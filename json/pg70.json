Man the Machine. b. Personal Merit\r\n\r\n[The Old Man and the Young Man had been conversing. The Old Man had\r\nasserted that the human being is merely a machine, and nothing more. The\r\nYoung Man objected, and asked him to go into particulars and furnish his\r\nreasons for his position.]\r\n\r\nOld Man. What are the materials of which a steam-engine is made?\r\n\r\nYoung Man. Iron, steel, brass, white-metal, and so on.\r\n\r\nO.M. Where are these found?\r\n\r\nY.M. In the rocks.\r\n\r\nO.M. In a pure state?\r\n\r\nY.M. No--in ores.\r\n\r\nO.M. Are the metals suddenly deposited in the ores?\r\n\r\nY.M. No--it is the patient work of countless ages.\r\n\r\nO.M. You could make the engine out of the rocks themselves?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes, a brittle one and not valuable.\r\n\r\nO.M. You would not require much, of such an engine as that?\r\n\r\nY.M. No--substantially nothing.\r\n\r\nO.M. To make a fine and capable engine, how would you proceed?\r\n\r\nY.M. Drive tunnels and shafts into the hills; blast out the iron ore;\r\ncrush it, smelt it, reduce it to pig-iron; put some of it through\r\nthe Bessemer process and make steel of it. Mine and treat and combine\r\nseveral metals of which brass is made.\r\n\r\nO.M. Then?\r\n\r\nY.M. Out of the perfected result, build the fine engine.\r\n\r\nO.M. You would require much of this one?\r\n\r\nY.M. Oh, indeed yes.\r\n\r\nO.M. It could drive lathes, drills, planers, punches, polishers, in a\r\nword all the cunning machines of a great factory?\r\n\r\nY.M. It could.\r\n\r\nO.M. What could the stone engine do?\r\n\r\nY.M. Drive a sewing-machine, possibly--nothing more, perhaps.\r\n\r\nO.M. Men would admire the other engine and rapturously praise it?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes.\r\n\r\nO.M. But not the stone one?\r\n\r\nY.M. No.\r\n\r\nO.M. The merits of the metal machine would be far above those of the\r\nstone one?\r\n\r\nY.M. Of course.\r\n\r\nO.M. Personal merits?\r\n\r\nY.M. _Personal_ merits? How do you mean?\r\n\r\nO.M. It would be personally entitled to the credit of its own\r\nperformance?\r\n\r\nY.M. The engine? Certainly not.\r\n\r\nO.M. Why not?\r\n\r\nY.M. Because its performance is not personal. It is the result of the\r\nlaw of construction. It is not a _merit_ that it does the things which\r\nit is set to do--it can't _help_ doing them.\r\n\r\nO.M. And it is not a personal demerit in the stone machine that it does\r\nso little?\r\n\r\nY.M. Certainly not. It does no more and no less than the law of its make\r\npermits and compels it to do. There is nothing _personal_ about it; it\r\ncannot choose. In this process of \"working up to the matter\" is it your\r\nidea to work up to the proposition that man and a machine are about the\r\nsame thing, and that there is no personal merit in the performance of\r\neither?\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes--but do not be offended; I am meaning no offense. What makes\r\nthe grand difference between the stone engine and the steel one? Shall\r\nwe call it training, education? Shall we call the stone engine a savage\r\nand the steel one a civilized man? The original rock contained the stuff\r\nof which the steel one was built--but along with a lot of sulphur and\r\nstone and other obstructing inborn heredities, brought down from the old\r\ngeologic ages--prejudices, let us call them. Prejudices which nothing\r\nwithin the rock itself had either _power_ to remove or any _desire_ to\r\nremove. Will you take note of that phrase?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes. I have written it down; \"Prejudices which nothing within the\r\nrock itself had either power to remove or any desire to remove.\" Go on.\r\n\r\nO.M. Prejudices must be removed by _outside influences_ or not at all.\r\nPut that down.\r\n\r\nY.M. Very well; \"Must be removed by outside influences or not at all.\"\r\nGo on.\r\n\r\nO.M. The iron's prejudice against ridding itself of the cumbering rock.\r\nTo make it more exact, the iron's absolute _indifference_ as to whether\r\nthe rock be removed or not. Then comes the _outside influence_ and\r\ngrinds the rock to powder and sets the ore free. The _iron_ in the ore\r\nis still captive. An _outside influence_ smelts it free of the clogging\r\nore. The iron is emancipated iron, now, but indifferent to further\r\nprogress. An _outside influence_ beguiles it into the Bessemer furnace\r\nand refines it into steel of the first quality. It is educated, now--its\r\ntraining is complete. And it has reached its limit. By no possible\r\nprocess can it be educated into _gold_. Will you set that down?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes. \"Everything has its limit--iron ore cannot be educated into\r\ngold.\"\r\n\r\nO.M. There are gold men, and tin men, and copper men, and leaden men,\r\nand steel men, and so on--and each has the limitations of his nature,\r\nhis heredities, his training, and his environment. You can build engines\r\nout of each of these metals, and they will all perform, but you must\r\nnot require the weak ones to do equal work with the strong ones. In\r\neach case, to get the best results, you must free the metal from its\r\nobstructing prejudicial ones by education--smelting, refining, and so\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nY.M. You have arrived at man, now?\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes. Man the machine--man the impersonal engine. Whatsoever a man\r\nis, is due to his _make_, and to the _influences_ brought to bear\r\nupon it by his heredities, his habitat, his associations. He is moved,\r\ndirected, COMMANDED, by _exterior_ influences--_solely_. He _originates_\r\nnothing, not even a thought.\r\n\r\nY.M. Oh, come! Where did I get my opinion that this which you are\r\ntalking is all foolishness?\r\n\r\nO.M. It is a quite natural opinion--indeed an inevitable opinion--but\r\n_you _did not create the materials out of which it is formed. They are\r\nodds and ends of thoughts, impressions, feelings, gathered unconsciously\r\nfrom a thousand books, a thousand conversations, and from streams of\r\nthought and feeling which have flowed down into your heart and brain out\r\nof the hearts and brains of centuries of ancestors. _Personally_ you did\r\nnot create even the smallest microscopic fragment of the materials out\r\nof which your opinion is made; and personally you cannot claim even the\r\nslender merit of _putting the borrowed materials together_. That was\r\ndone _automatically_--by your mental machinery, in strict accordance\r\nwith the law of that machinery's construction. And you not only did not\r\nmake that machinery yourself, but you have _not even any command over\r\nit_.\r\n\r\nY.M. This is too much. You think I could have formed no opinion but that\r\none?\r\n\r\nO.M. Spontaneously? No. And _you did not form that one_; your machinery\r\ndid it for you--automatically and instantly, without reflection or the\r\nneed of it.\r\n\r\nY.M. Suppose I had reflected? How then?\r\n\r\nO.M. Suppose you try?\r\n\r\nY.M. (_After a quarter of an hour_.) I have reflected.\r\n\r\nO.M. You mean you have tried to change your opinion--as an experiment?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes.\r\n\r\nO.M. With success?\r\n\r\nY.M. No. It remains the same; it is impossible to change it.\r\n\r\nO.M. I am sorry, but you see, yourself, that your mind is merely a\r\nmachine, nothing more. You have no command over it, it has no command\r\nover itself--it is worked _solely from the outside_. That is the law of\r\nits make; it is the law of all machines.\r\n\r\nY.M. Can't I _ever_ change one of these automatic opinions?\r\n\r\nO.M. No. You can't yourself, but _exterior influences_ can do it.\r\n\r\nY.M. And exterior ones _only_?\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes--exterior ones only.\r\n\r\nY.M. That position is untenable--I may say ludicrously untenable.\r\n\r\nO.M. What makes you think so?\r\n\r\nY.M. I don't merely think it, I know it. Suppose I resolve to enter upon\r\na course of thought, and study, and reading, with the deliberate purpose\r\nof changing that opinion; and suppose I succeed. _That _is not the work\r\nof an exterior impulse, the whole of it is mine and personal; for I\r\noriginated the project.\r\n\r\nO.M. Not a shred of it. _It grew out of this talk with me_. But for that\r\nit would not have occurred to you. No man ever originates anything. All\r\nhis thoughts, all his impulses, come _from the outside_.\r\n\r\nY.M. It's an exasperating subject. The _first_ man had original\r\nthoughts, anyway; there was nobody to draw from.\r\n\r\nO.M. It is a mistake. Adam's thoughts came to him from the outside.\r\n_You_ have a fear of death. You did not invent that--you got it from\r\noutside, from talking and teaching. Adam had no fear of death--none in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes, he had.\r\n\r\nO.M. When he was created?\r\n\r\nY.M. No.\r\n\r\nO.M. When, then?\r\n\r\nY.M. When he was threatened with it.\r\n\r\nO.M. Then it came from _outside_. Adam is quite big enough; let us not\r\ntry to make a god of him. _None but gods have ever had a thought which\r\ndid not come from the outside_. Adam probably had a good head, but it\r\nwas of no sort of use to him until it was filled up _from the outside_.\r\nHe was not able to invent the triflingest little thing with it. He had\r\nnot a shadow of a notion of the difference between good and evil--he\r\nhad to get the idea _from the outside_. Neither he nor Eve was able to\r\noriginate the idea that it was immodest to go naked; the knowledge came\r\nin with the apple _from the outside_. A man's brain is so constructed\r\nthat _it can originate nothing whatsoever_. It can only use material\r\nobtained _outside_. It is merely a machine; and it works automatically,\r\nnot by will-power. _It has no command over itself, its owner has no\r\ncommand over it_.\r\n\r\nY.M. Well, never mind Adam: but certainly Shakespeare's creations--\r\n\r\nO.M. No, you mean Shakespeare's _imitations_. Shakespeare created\r\nnothing. He correctly observed, and he marvelously painted. He exactly\r\nportrayed people whom _God_ had created; but he created none himself.\r\nLet us spare him the slander of charging him with trying. Shakespeare\r\ncould not create. _He was a machine, and machines do not create_.\r\n\r\nY.M. Where _was_ his excellence, then?\r\n\r\nO.M. In this. He was not a sewing-machine, like you and me; he was\r\na Gobelin loom. The threads and the colors came into him _from the\r\noutside_; outside influences, suggestions, _experiences_ (reading,\r\nseeing plays, playing plays, borrowing ideas, and so on), framed the\r\npatterns in his mind and started up his complex and admirable machinery,\r\nand _it automatically_ turned out that pictured and gorgeous fabric\r\nwhich still compels the astonishment of the world. If Shakespeare had\r\nbeen born and bred on a barren and unvisited rock in the ocean his\r\nmighty intellect would have had no _outside material_ to work with,\r\nand could have invented none; and _no outside influences_, teachings,\r\nmoldings, persuasions, inspirations, of a valuable sort, and could have\r\ninvented none; and so Shakespeare would have produced nothing. In Turkey\r\nhe would have produced something--something up to the highest limit of\r\nTurkish influences, associations, and training. In France he would have\r\nproduced something better--something up to the highest limit of the\r\nFrench influences and training. In England he rose to the highest limit\r\nattainable through the _outside helps afforded by that land's ideals,\r\ninfluences, and training_. You and I are but sewing-machines. We must\r\nturn out what we can; we must do our endeavor and care nothing at all\r\nwhen the unthinking reproach us for not turning out Gobelins.\r\n\r\nY.M. And so we are mere machines! And machines may not boast, nor\r\nfeel proud of their performance, nor claim personal merit for it, nor\r\napplause and praise. It is an infamous doctrine.\r\n\r\nO.M. It isn't a doctrine, it is merely a fact.\r\n\r\nY.M. I suppose, then, there is no more merit in being brave than in\r\nbeing a coward?\r\n\r\nO.M. _Personal_ merit? No. A brave man does not _create_ his bravery. He\r\nis entitled to no personal credit for possessing it. It is born to him.\r\nA baby born with a billion dollars--where is the personal merit in that?\r\nA baby born with nothing--where is the personal demerit in that? The\r\none is fawned upon, admired, worshiped, by sycophants, the other is\r\nneglected and despised--where is the sense in it?\r\n\r\nY.M. Sometimes a timid man sets himself the task of conquering his\r\ncowardice and becoming brave--and succeeds. What do you say to that?\r\n\r\nO.M. That it shows the value of _training in right directions over\r\ntraining in wrong ones_. Inestimably valuable is training, influence,\r\neducation, in right directions--_training one's self-approbation to\r\nelevate its ideals_.\r\n\r\nY.M. But as to merit--the personal merit of the victorious coward's\r\nproject and achievement?\r\n\r\nO.M. There isn't any. In the world's view he is a worthier man than he\r\nwas before, but _he_ didn't achieve the change--the merit of it is not\r\nhis.\r\n\r\nY.M. Whose, then?\r\n\r\nO.M. His _make_, and the influences which wrought upon it from the\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nY.M. His make?\r\n\r\nO.M. To start with, he was _not_ utterly and completely a coward, or the\r\ninfluences would have had nothing to work upon. He was not afraid of a\r\ncow, though perhaps of a bull: not afraid of a woman, but afraid of a\r\nman. There was something to build upon. There was a _seed_. No seed, no\r\nplant. Did he make that seed himself, or was it born in him? It was no\r\nmerit of _his_ that the seed was there.\r\n\r\nY.M. Well, anyway, the idea of _cultivating_ it, the resolution to\r\ncultivate it, was meritorious, and he originated that.\r\n\r\nO.M. He did nothing of the kind. It came whence _all_ impulses, good or\r\nbad, come--from _outside_. If that timid man had lived all his life in\r\na community of human rabbits, had never read of brave deeds, had never\r\nheard speak of them, had never heard any one praise them nor express\r\nenvy of the heroes that had done them, he would have had no more idea of\r\nbravery than Adam had of modesty, and it could never by any possibility\r\nhave occurred to him to _resolve_ to become brave. He _could not\r\noriginate the idea_--it had to come to him from the _outside_. And so,\r\nwhen he heard bravery extolled and cowardice derided, it woke him up. He\r\nwas ashamed. Perhaps his sweetheart turned up her nose and said, \"I am\r\ntold that you are a coward!\" It was not _he_ that turned over the new\r\nleaf--she did it for him. _He_ must not strut around in the merit of it\r\n--it is not his.\r\n\r\nY.M. But, anyway, he reared the plant after she watered the seed.\r\n\r\nO.M. No. _Outside influences_ reared it. At the command--and\r\ntrembling--he marched out into the field--with other soldiers and in the\r\ndaytime, not alone and in the dark. He had the _influence of example_,\r\nhe drew courage from his comrades' courage; he was afraid, and wanted\r\nto run, but he did not dare; he was _afraid_ to run, with all those\r\nsoldiers looking on. He was progressing, you see--the moral fear of\r\nshame had risen superior to the physical fear of harm. By the end of\r\nthe campaign experience will have taught him that not _all_ who go into\r\nbattle get hurt--an outside influence which will be helpful to him; and\r\nhe will also have learned how sweet it is to be praised for courage and\r\nbe huzza'd at with tear-choked voices as the war-worn regiment marches\r\npast the worshiping multitude with flags flying and the drums beating.\r\nAfter that he will be as securely brave as any veteran in the army--and\r\nthere will not be a shade nor suggestion of _personal merit_ in it\r\nanywhere; it will all have come from the _outside_. The Victoria Cross\r\nbreeds more heroes than--\r\n\r\nY.M. Hang it, where is the sense in his becoming brave if he is to get\r\nno credit for it?\r\n\r\nO.M. Your question will answer itself presently. It involves an\r\nimportant detail of man's make which we have not yet touched upon.\r\n\r\nY.M. What detail is that?\r\n\r\nO.M. The impulse which moves a person to do things--the only impulse\r\nthat ever moves a person to do a thing.\r\n\r\nY.M. The _only_ one! Is there but one?\r\n\r\nO.M. That is all. There is only one.\r\n\r\nY.M. Well, certainly that is a strange enough doctrine. What is the sole\r\nimpulse that ever moves a person to do a thing?\r\n\r\nO.M. The impulse to _content his own spirit_--the _necessity_ of\r\ncontenting his own spirit and _winning its approval_.\r\n\r\nY.M. Oh, come, that won't do!\r\n\r\nO.M. Why won't it?\r\n\r\nY.M. Because it puts him in the attitude of always looking out for his\r\nown comfort and advantage; whereas an unselfish man often does a thing\r\nsolely for another person's good when it is a positive disadvantage to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nO.M. It is a mistake. The act must do _him_ good, _first_; otherwise\r\nhe will not do it. He may _think_ he is doing it solely for the other\r\nperson's sake, but it is not so; he is contenting his own spirit\r\nfirst--the other's person's benefit has to always take _second_ place.\r\n\r\nY.M. What a fantastic idea! What becomes of self--sacrifice? Please\r\nanswer me that.\r\n\r\nO.M. What is self-sacrifice?\r\n\r\nY.M. The doing good to another person where no shadow nor suggestion of\r\nbenefit to one's self can result from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nMan's Sole Impulse--the Securing of His Own Approval\r\n\r\nOld Man. There have been instances of it--you think?\r\n\r\nYoung Man. _Instances_? Millions of them!\r\n\r\nO.M. You have not jumped to conclusions? You have examined\r\nthem--critically?\r\n\r\nY.M. They don't need it: the acts themselves reveal the golden impulse\r\nback of them.\r\n\r\nO.M. For instance?\r\n\r\nY.M. Well, then, for instance. Take the case in the book here. The man\r\nlives three miles up-town. It is bitter cold, snowing hard, midnight.\r\nHe is about to enter the horse-car when a gray and ragged old woman, a\r\ntouching picture of misery, puts out her lean hand and begs for rescue\r\nfrom hunger and death. The man finds that he has a quarter in his\r\npocket, but he does not hesitate: he gives it her and trudges home\r\nthrough the storm. There--it is noble, it is beautiful; its grace is\r\nmarred by no fleck or blemish or suggestion of self-interest.\r\n\r\nO.M. What makes you think that?\r\n\r\nY.M. Pray what else could I think? Do you imagine that there is some\r\nother way of looking at it?\r\n\r\nO.M. Can you put yourself in the man's place and tell me what he felt\r\nand what he thought?\r\n\r\nY.M. Easily. The sight of that suffering old face pierced his generous\r\nheart with a sharp pain. He could not bear it. He could endure the\r\nthree-mile walk in the storm, but he could not endure the tortures his\r\nconscience would suffer if he turned his back and left that poor old\r\ncreature to perish. He would not have been able to sleep, for thinking\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nO.M. What was his state of mind on his way home?\r\n\r\nY.M. It was a state of joy which only the self-sacrificer knows. His\r\nheart sang, he was unconscious of the storm.\r\n\r\nO.M. He felt well?\r\n\r\nY.M. One cannot doubt it.\r\n\r\nO.M. Very well. Now let us add up the details and see how much he got\r\nfor his twenty-five cents. Let us try to find out the _real_ why of his\r\nmaking the investment. In the first place _he_ couldn't bear the pain\r\nwhich the old suffering face gave him. So he was thinking of _his_\r\npain--this good man. He must buy a salve for it. If he did not succor\r\nthe old woman _his_ conscience would torture him all the way home.\r\nThinking of _his_ pain again. He must buy relief for that. If he didn't\r\nrelieve the old woman _he_ would not get any sleep. He must buy some\r\nsleep--still thinking of _himself_, you see. Thus, to sum up, he bought\r\nhimself free of a sharp pain in his heart, he bought himself free of the\r\ntortures of a waiting conscience, he bought a whole night's sleep--all\r\nfor twenty-five cents! It should make Wall Street ashamed of itself. On\r\nhis way home his heart was joyful, and it sang--profit on top of profit!\r\nThe impulse which moved the man to succor the old woman was--_first_--to\r\n_content his own spirit_; secondly to relieve _her_ sufferings. Is it\r\nyour opinion that men's acts proceed from one central and unchanging and\r\ninalterable impulse, or from a variety of impulses?\r\n\r\nY.M. From a variety, of course--some high and fine and noble, others\r\nnot. What is your opinion?\r\n\r\nO.M. Then there is but _one_ law, one source.\r\n\r\nY.M. That both the noblest impulses and the basest proceed from that one\r\nsource?\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes.\r\n\r\nY.M. Will you put that law into words?\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes. This is the law, keep it in your mind. _From his cradle to his\r\ngrave a man never does a single thing which has any_ FIRST AND FOREMOST\r\n_object_ _but one_--_to secure peace of mind, spiritual comfort_,\r\n_for_ HIMSELF.\r\n\r\nY.M. Come! He never does anything for any one else's comfort, spiritual\r\nor physical?\r\n\r\nO.M. No. _except on those distinct terms_--that it shall _first_ secure\r\n_his own_ spiritual comfort. Otherwise he will not do it.\r\n\r\nY.M. It will be easy to expose the falsity of that proposition.\r\n\r\nO.M. For instance?\r\n\r\nY.M. Take that noble passion, love of country, patriotism. A man who\r\nloves peace and dreads pain, leaves his pleasant home and his weeping\r\nfamily and marches out to manfully expose himself to hunger, cold,\r\nwounds, and death. Is that seeking spiritual comfort?\r\n\r\nO.M. He loves peace and dreads pain?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes.\r\n\r\nO.M. Then perhaps there is something that he loves _more_ than he loves\r\npeace--_the approval of his neighbors and the public_. And perhaps there\r\nis something which he dreads more than he dreads pain--the _disapproval_\r\nof his neighbors and the public. If he is sensitive to shame he will\r\ngo to the field--not because his spirit will be _entirely_ comfortable\r\nthere, but because it will be more comfortable there than it would be\r\nif he remained at home. He will always do the thing which will bring him\r\nthe _most_ mental comfort--for that is _the sole law of his life_.\r\nHe leaves the weeping family behind; he is sorry to make them\r\nuncomfortable, but not sorry enough to sacrifice his _own_ comfort to\r\nsecure theirs.\r\n\r\nY.M. Do you really believe that mere public opinion could force a timid\r\nand peaceful man to--\r\n\r\nO.M. Go to war? Yes--public opinion can force some men to do _anything_.\r\n\r\nY.M. _Anything_?\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes--anything.\r\n\r\nY.M. I don't believe that. Can it force a right-principled man to do a\r\nwrong thing?\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes.\r\n\r\nY.M. Can it force a kind man to do a cruel thing?\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes.\r\n\r\nY.M. Give an instance.\r\n\r\nO.M. Alexander Hamilton was a conspicuously high-principled man.\r\nHe regarded dueling as wrong, and as opposed to the teachings of\r\nreligion--but in deference to _public opinion_ he fought a duel. He\r\ndeeply loved his family, but to buy public approval he treacherously\r\ndeserted them and threw his life away, ungenerously leaving them to\r\nlifelong sorrow in order that he might stand well with a foolish world.\r\nIn the then condition of the public standards of honor he could not have\r\nbeen comfortable with the stigma upon him of having refused to fight.\r\nThe teachings of religion, his devotion to his family, his kindness of\r\nheart, his high principles, all went for nothing when they stood in the\r\nway of his spiritual comfort. A man will do _anything_, no matter what\r\nit is, _to secure his spiritual comfort_; and he can neither be forced\r\nnor persuaded to any act which has not that goal for its object.\r\nHamilton's act was compelled by the inborn necessity of contenting his\r\nown spirit; in this it was like all the other acts of his life, and\r\nlike all the acts of all men's lives. Do you see where the kernel of the\r\nmatter lies? A man cannot be comfortable without _his own_ approval.\r\nHe will secure the largest share possible of that, at all costs, all\r\nsacrifices.\r\n\r\nY.M. A minute ago you said Hamilton fought that duel to get _public_\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nO.M. I did. By refusing to fight the duel he would have secured his\r\nfamily's approval and a large share of his own; but the public approval\r\nwas more valuable in his eyes than all other approvals put together--in\r\nthe earth or above it; to secure that would furnish him the _most_\r\ncomfort of mind, the most _self_--approval; so he sacrificed all other\r\nvalues to get it.\r\n\r\nY.M. Some noble souls have refused to fight duels, and have manfully\r\nbraved the public contempt.\r\n\r\nO.M. They acted _according to their make_. They valued their principles\r\nand the approval of their families _above_ the public approval. They\r\ntook the thing they valued _most_ and let the rest go. They took\r\nwhat would give them the _largest_ share of _personal contentment and\r\napproval_--a man _always_ does. Public opinion cannot force that kind\r\nof men to go to the wars. When they go it is for other reasons. Other\r\nspirit-contenting reasons.\r\n\r\nY.M. Always spirit-contenting reasons?\r\n\r\nO.M. There are no others.\r\n\r\nY.M. When a man sacrifices his life to save a little child from a\r\nburning building, what do you call that?\r\n\r\nO.M. When he does it, it is the law of _his_ make. _He_ can't bear to\r\nsee the child in that peril (a man of a different make _could_), and so\r\nhe tries to save the child, and loses his life. But he has got what he\r\nwas after--_his own approval_.\r\n\r\nY.M. What do you call Love, Hate, Charity, Revenge, Humanity,\r\nMagnanimity, Forgiveness?\r\n\r\nO.M. Different results of the one Master Impulse: the necessity of\r\nsecuring one's self approval. They wear diverse clothes and are subject\r\nto diverse moods, but in whatsoever ways they masquerade they are the\r\n_same person_ all the time. To change the figure, the _compulsion_ that\r\nmoves a man--and there is but the one--is the necessity of securing the\r\ncontentment of his own spirit. When it stops, the man is dead.\r\n\r\nY.M. That is foolishness. Love--\r\n\r\nO.M. Why, love is that impulse, that law, in its most uncompromising\r\nform. It will squander life and everything else on its object. Not\r\n_primarily_ for the object's sake, but for _its own_. When its object is\r\nhappy _it_ is happy--and that is what it is unconsciously after.\r\n\r\nY.M. You do not even except the lofty and gracious passion of\r\nmother-love?\r\n\r\nO.M. No, _it _is the absolute slave of that law. The mother will go\r\nnaked to clothe her child; she will starve that it may have food; suffer\r\ntorture to save it from pain; die that it may live. She takes a\r\nliving _pleasure_ in making these sacrifices. _She does it for that\r\nreward_--that self-approval, that contentment, that peace, that comfort.\r\n_She would do it for your child_ IF SHE COULD GET THE SAME PAY.\r\n\r\nY.M. This is an infernal philosophy of yours.\r\n\r\nO.M. It isn't a philosophy, it is a fact.\r\n\r\nY.M. Of course you must admit that there are some acts which--\r\n\r\nO.M. No. There is _no_ act, large or small, fine or mean, which springs\r\nfrom any motive but the one--the necessity of appeasing and contenting\r\none's own spirit.\r\n\r\nY.M. The world's philanthropists--\r\n\r\nO.M. I honor them, I uncover my head to them--from habit and training;\r\nand _they_ could not know comfort or happiness or self-approval if they\r\ndid not work and spend for the unfortunate. It makes _them_ happy to\r\nsee others happy; and so with money and labor they buy what they are\r\nafter--_happiness, self-approval_. Why don't miners do the same thing?\r\nBecause they can get a thousandfold more happiness by _not_ doing it.\r\nThere is no other reason. They follow the law of their make.\r\n\r\nY.M. What do you say of duty for duty's sake?\r\n\r\nO.M. That _it does not exist_. Duties are not performed for duty's\r\n_sake_, but because their _neglect_ would make the man _uncomfortable_.\r\nA man performs but _one_ duty--the duty of contenting his spirit, the\r\nduty of making himself agreeable to himself. If he can most satisfyingly\r\nperform this sole and only duty by _helping_ his neighbor, he will do\r\nit; if he can most satisfyingly perform it by _swindling_ his neighbor,\r\nhe will do it. But he always looks out for Number One--_first_;\r\nthe effects upon others are a _secondary_ matter. Men pretend to\r\nself-sacrifices, but this is a thing which, in the ordinary value of\r\nthe phrase, _does not exist and has not existed_. A man often honestly\r\n_thinks_ he is sacrificing himself merely and solely for some one else,\r\nbut he is deceived; his bottom impulse is to content a requirement of\r\nhis nature and training, and thus acquire peace for his soul.\r\n\r\nY.M. Apparently, then, all men, both good and bad ones, devote their\r\nlives to contenting their consciences.\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes. That is a good enough name for it: Conscience--that\r\nindependent Sovereign, that insolent absolute Monarch inside of a man\r\nwho is the man's Master. There are all kinds of consciences, because\r\nthere are all kinds of men. You satisfy an assassin's conscience in one\r\nway, a philanthropist's in another, a miser's in another, a burglar's\r\nin still another. As a _guide_ or _incentive_ to any authoritatively\r\nprescribed line of morals or conduct (leaving _training_ out of the\r\naccount), a man's conscience is totally valueless. I know a kind-hearted\r\nKentuckian whose self-approval was lacking--whose conscience was\r\ntroubling him, to phrase it with exactness--_because he had neglected\r\nto kill a certain man_--a man whom he had never seen. The stranger had\r\nkilled this man's friend in a fight, this man's Kentucky training made\r\nit a duty to kill the stranger for it. He neglected his duty--kept\r\ndodging it, shirking it, putting it off, and his unrelenting conscience\r\nkept persecuting him for this conduct. At last, to get ease of mind,\r\ncomfort, self-approval, he hunted up the stranger and took his life. It\r\nwas an immense act of _self-sacrifice_ (as per the usual definition),\r\nfor he did not want to do it, and he never would have done it if he\r\ncould have bought a contented spirit and an unworried mind at\r\nsmaller cost. But we are so made that we will pay _anything_ for that\r\ncontentment--even another man's life.\r\n\r\nY.M. You spoke a moment ago of _trained_ consciences. You mean that we\r\nare not _born_ with consciences competent to guide us aright?\r\n\r\nO.M. If we were, children and savages would know right from wrong, and\r\nnot have to be taught it.\r\n\r\nY.M. But consciences can be _trained_?\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes.\r\n\r\nY.M. Of course by parents, teachers, the pulpit, and books.\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes--they do their share; they do what they can.\r\n\r\nY.M. And the rest is done by--\r\n\r\nO.M. Oh, a million unnoticed influences--for good or bad: influences\r\nwhich work without rest during every waking moment of a man's life, from\r\ncradle to grave.\r\n\r\nY.M. You have tabulated these?\r\n\r\nO.M. Many of them--yes.\r\n\r\nY.M. Will you read me the result?\r\n\r\nO.M. Another time, yes. It would take an hour.\r\n\r\nY.M. A conscience can be trained to shun evil and prefer good?\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes.\r\n\r\nY.M. But will it for spirit-contenting reasons only?\r\n\r\nO.M. It _can't_ be trained to do a thing for any _other_ reason. The\r\nthing is impossible.\r\n\r\nY.M. There _must_ be a genuinely and utterly self-sacrificing act\r\nrecorded in human history somewhere.\r\n\r\nO.M. You are young. You have many years before you. Search one out.\r\n\r\nY.M. It does seem to me that when a man sees a fellow-being struggling\r\nin the water and jumps in at the risk of his life to save him--\r\n\r\nO.M. Wait. Describe the _man_. Describe the _fellow-being_. State if\r\nthere is an _audience_ present; or if they are _alone_.\r\n\r\nY.M. What have these things to do with the splendid act?\r\n\r\nO.M. Very much. Shall we suppose, as a beginning, that the two are\r\nalone, in a solitary place, at midnight?\r\n\r\nY.M. If you choose.\r\n\r\nO.M. And that the fellow-being is the man's daughter?\r\n\r\nY.M. Well, n-no--make it someone else.\r\n\r\nO.M. A filthy, drunken ruffian, then?\r\n\r\nY.M. I see. Circumstances alter cases. I suppose that if there was no\r\naudience to observe the act, the man wouldn't perform it.\r\n\r\nO.M. But there is here and there a man who _would_. People, for\r\ninstance, like the man who lost his life trying to save the child from\r\nthe fire; and the man who gave the needy old woman his twenty-five cents\r\nand walked home in the storm--there are here and there men like that who\r\nwould do it. And why? Because they couldn't _bear_ to see a fellow-being\r\nstruggling in the water and not jump in and help. It would give _them_\r\npain. They would save the fellow-being on that account. _They wouldn't\r\ndo it otherwise_. They strictly obey the law which I have been insisting\r\nupon. You must remember and always distinguish the people who _can't\r\nbear_ things from people who _can_. It will throw light upon a number of\r\napparently \"self-sacrificing\" cases.\r\n\r\nY.M. Oh, dear, it's all so disgusting.\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes. And so true.\r\n\r\nY.M. Come--take the good boy who does things he doesn't want to do, in\r\norder to gratify his mother.\r\n\r\nO.M. He does seven-tenths of the act because it gratifies _him_ to\r\ngratify his mother. Throw the bulk of advantage the other way and the\r\ngood boy would not do the act. He _must_ obey the iron law. None can\r\nescape it.\r\n\r\nY.M. Well, take the case of a bad boy who--\r\n\r\nO.M. You needn't mention it, it is a waste of time. It is no matter\r\nabout the bad boy's act. Whatever it was, he had a spirit-contenting\r\nreason for it. Otherwise you have been misinformed, and he didn't do it.\r\n\r\nY.M. It is very exasperating. A while ago you said that man's conscience\r\nis not a born judge of morals and conduct, but has to be taught and\r\ntrained. Now I think a conscience can get drowsy and lazy, but I don't\r\nthink it can go wrong; if you wake it up--\r\n\r\n_A Little Story_\r\n\r\nO.M. I will tell you a little story:\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time an Infidel was guest in the house of a Christian widow\r\nwhose little boy was ill and near to death. The Infidel often watched\r\nby the bedside and entertained the boy with talk, and he used these\r\nopportunities to satisfy a strong longing in his nature--that desire\r\nwhich is in us all to better other people's condition by having them\r\nthink as we think. He was successful. But the dying boy, in his last\r\nmoments, reproached him and said:\r\n\r\n\"_I believed, and was happy in it; you have taken my belief away, and\r\nmy comfort. Now I have nothing left, and I die miserable; for the\r\nthings which you have told me do not take the place of that which I have\r\nlost_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the mother, also, reproached the Infidel, and said:\r\n\r\n\"_My child is forever lost, and my heart is broken. How could you do\r\nthis cruel thing? We have done you no harm, but only kindness; we made\r\nour house your home, you were welcome to all we had, and this is our\r\nreward.\"_\r\n\r\nThe heart of the Infidel was filled with remorse for what he had done,\r\nand he said:\r\n\r\n\"_It was wrong--I see it now; but I was only trying to do him good. In\r\nmy view he was in error; it seemed my duty to teach him the truth_.\"\r\n\r\nThen the mother said:\r\n\r\n\"_I had taught him, all his little life, what I believed to be the\r\ntruth, and in his believing faith both of us were happy. Now he is\r\ndead,--and lost; and I am miserable. Our faith came down to us through\r\ncenturies of believing ancestors; what right had you, or any one, to\r\ndisturb it? Where was your honor, where was your shame_?\"\r\n\r\nY.M. He was a miscreant, and deserved death!\r\n\r\nO.M. He thought so himself, and said so.\r\n\r\nY.M. Ah--you see, _his conscience was awakened_!\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes, his Self-Disapproval was. It _pained_ him to see the mother\r\nsuffer. He was sorry he had done a thing which brought _him_ pain. It\r\ndid not occur to him to think of the mother when he was misteaching\r\nthe boy, for he was absorbed in providing _pleasure_ for himself, then.\r\nProviding it by satisfying what he believed to be a call of duty.\r\n\r\nY.M. Call it what you please, it is to me a case of _awakened\r\nconscience_. That awakened conscience could never get itself into that\r\nspecies of trouble again. A cure like that is a _permanent_ cure.\r\n\r\nO.M. Pardon--I had not finished the story. We are creatures of _outside\r\ninfluences_--we originate _nothing_ within. Whenever we take a new line\r\nof thought and drift into a new line of belief and action, the impulse\r\nis _always_ suggested from the _outside_. Remorse so preyed upon the\r\nInfidel that it dissolved his harshness toward the boy's religion and\r\nmade him come to regard it with tolerance, next with kindness, for the\r\nboy's sake and the mother's. Finally he found himself examining it.\r\nFrom that moment his progress in his new trend was steady and rapid. He\r\nbecame a believing Christian. And now his remorse for having robbed the\r\ndying boy of his faith and his salvation was bitterer than ever. It gave\r\nhim no rest, no peace. He _must_ have rest and peace--it is the law of\r\nnature. There seemed but one way to get it; he must devote himself to\r\nsaving imperiled souls. He became a missionary. He landed in a pagan\r\ncountry ill and helpless. A native widow took him into her humble home\r\nand nursed him back to convalescence. Then her young boy was taken\r\nhopelessly ill, and the grateful missionary helped her tend him. Here\r\nwas his first opportunity to repair a part of the wrong done to the\r\nother boy by doing a precious service for this one by undermining his\r\nfoolish faith in his false gods. He was successful. But the dying boy in\r\nhis last moments reproached him and said:\r\n\r\n\"_I believed, and was happy in it; you have taken my belief away, and\r\nmy comfort. Now I have nothing left, and I die miserable; for the\r\nthings which you have told me do not take the place of that which I have\r\nlost_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the mother, also, reproached the missionary, and said:\r\n\r\n\"_My child is forever lost, and my heart is broken. How could you do\r\nthis cruel thing? We had done you no harm, but only kindness; we made\r\nour house your home, you were welcome to all we had, and this is our\r\nreward_.\"\r\n\r\nThe heart of the missionary was filled with remorse for what he had\r\ndone, and he said:\r\n\r\n\"_It was wrong--I see it now; but I was only trying to do him good. In\r\nmy view he was in error; it seemed my duty to teach him the truth_.\"\r\n\r\nThen the mother said:\r\n\r\n\"_I had taught him, all his little life, what I believed to be the\r\ntruth, and in his believing faith both of us were happy. Now he is\r\ndead--and lost; and I am miserable. Our faith came down to us through\r\ncenturies of believing ancestors; what right had you, or any one, to\r\ndisturb it? Where was your honor, where was your shame_?\"\r\n\r\nThe missionary's anguish of remorse and sense of treachery were as\r\nbitter and persecuting and unappeasable, now, as they had been in the\r\nformer case. The story is finished. What is your comment?\r\n\r\nY.M. The man's conscience is a fool! It was morbid. It didn't know right\r\nfrom wrong.\r\n\r\nO.M. I am not sorry to hear you say that. If you grant that _one_ man's\r\nconscience doesn't know right from wrong, it is an admission that there\r\nare others like it. This single admission pulls down the whole doctrine\r\nof infallibility of judgment in consciences. Meantime there is one thing\r\nwhich I ask you to notice.\r\n\r\nY.M. What is that?\r\n\r\nO.M. That in both cases the man's _act_ gave him no spiritual\r\ndiscomfort, and that he was quite satisfied with it and got pleasure out\r\nof it. But afterward when it resulted in _pain_ to _him_, he was sorry.\r\nSorry it had inflicted pain upon the others, _but for no reason under\r\nthe sun except that their pain gave him pain_. Our consciences take _no_\r\nnotice of pain inflicted upon others until it reaches a point where it\r\ngives pain to _us_. In _all_ cases without exception we are absolutely\r\nindifferent to another person's pain until his sufferings make us\r\nuncomfortable. Many an infidel would not have been troubled by that\r\nChristian mother's distress. Don't you believe that?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes. You might almost say it of the _average_ infidel, I think.\r\n\r\nO.M. And many a missionary, sternly fortified by his sense of duty,\r\nwould not have been troubled by the pagan mother's distress--Jesuit\r\nmissionaries in Canada in the early French times, for instance; see\r\nepisodes quoted by Parkman.\r\n\r\nY.M. Well, let us adjourn. Where have we arrived?\r\n\r\nO.M. At this. That we (mankind) have ticketed ourselves with a number of\r\nqualities to which we have given misleading names. Love, Hate, Charity,\r\nCompassion, Avarice, Benevolence, and so on. I mean we attach misleading\r\n_meanings_ to the names. They are all forms of self-contentment,\r\nself-gratification, but the names so disguise them that they distract\r\nour attention from the fact. Also we have smuggled a word into the\r\ndictionary which ought not to be there at all--Self-Sacrifice. It\r\ndescribes a thing which does not exist. But worst of all, we ignore and\r\nnever mention the Sole Impulse which dictates and compels a man's every\r\nact: the imperious necessity of securing his own approval, in every\r\nemergency and at all costs. To it we owe all that we are. It is our\r\nbreath, our heart, our blood. It is our only spur, our whip, our goad,\r\nour only impelling power; we have no other. Without it we should be\r\nmere inert images, corpses; no one would do anything, there would be\r\nno progress, the world would stand still. We ought to stand reverently\r\nuncovered when the name of that stupendous power is uttered.\r\n\r\nY.M. I am not convinced.\r\n\r\nO.M. You will be when you think.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nInstances in Point\r\n\r\nOld Man. Have you given thought to the Gospel of Self--Approval since we\r\ntalked?\r\n\r\nYoung Man. I have.\r\n\r\nO.M. It was I that moved you to it. That is to say an _outside\r\ninfluence_ moved you to it--not one that originated in your head. Will\r\nyou try to keep that in mind and not forget it?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes. Why?\r\n\r\nO.M. Because by and by in one of our talks, I wish to further impress\r\nupon you that neither you, nor I, nor any man ever originates a thought\r\nin his own head. _The utterer of a thought always utters a second-hand\r\none_.\r\n\r\nY.M. Oh, now--\r\n\r\nO.M. Wait. Reserve your remark till we get to that part of our\r\ndiscussion--tomorrow or next day, say. Now, then, have you been\r\nconsidering the proposition that no act is ever born of any but a\r\nself-contenting impulse--(primarily). You have sought. What have you\r\nfound?\r\n\r\nY.M. I have not been very fortunate. I have examined many fine and\r\napparently self-sacrificing deeds in romances and biographies, but--\r\n\r\nO.M. Under searching analysis the ostensible self-sacrifice disappeared?\r\nIt naturally would.\r\n\r\nY.M. But here in this novel is one which seems to promise. In the\r\nAdirondack woods is a wage-earner and lay preacher in the lumber-camps\r\nwho is of noble character and deeply religious. An earnest and practical\r\nlaborer in the New York slums comes up there on vacation--he is leader\r\nof a section of the University Settlement. Holme, the lumberman, is\r\nfired with a desire to throw away his excellent worldly prospects and\r\ngo down and save souls on the East Side. He counts it happiness to make\r\nthis sacrifice for the glory of God and for the cause of Christ. He\r\nresigns his place, makes the sacrifice cheerfully, and goes to the East\r\nSide and preaches Christ and Him crucified every day and every night to\r\nlittle groups of half-civilized foreign paupers who scoff at him. But he\r\nrejoices in the scoffings, since he is suffering them in the great\r\ncause of Christ. You have so filled my mind with suspicions that I was\r\nconstantly expecting to find a hidden questionable impulse back of all\r\nthis, but I am thankful to say I have failed. This man saw his duty, and\r\nfor _duty's sake_ he sacrificed self and assumed the burden it imposed.\r\n\r\nO.M. Is that as far as you have read?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes.\r\n\r\nO.M. Let us read further, presently. Meantime, in sacrificing\r\nhimself--_not_ for the glory of God, _primarily_, as _he_ imagined, but\r\n_first_ to content that exacting and inflexible master within him--_did\r\nhe sacrifice anybody else_?\r\n\r\nY.M. How do you mean?\r\n\r\nO.M. He relinquished a lucrative post and got mere food and lodging in\r\nplace of it. Had he dependents?\r\n\r\nY.M. Well--yes.\r\n\r\nO.M. In what way and to what extend did his self-sacrifice affect\r\n_them_?\r\n\r\nY.M. He was the support of a superannuated father. He had a young sister\r\nwith a remarkable voice--he was giving her a musical education, so that\r\nher longing to be self-supporting might be gratified. He was furnishing\r\nthe money to put a young brother through a polytechnic school and\r\nsatisfy his desire to become a civil engineer.\r\n\r\nO.M. The old father's comforts were now curtailed?\r\n\r\nY.M. Quite seriously. Yes.\r\n\r\nO.M. The sister's music-lessens had to stop?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes.\r\n\r\nO.M. The young brother's education--well, an extinguishing blight fell\r\nupon that happy dream, and he had to go to sawing wood to support the\r\nold father, or something like that?\r\n\r\nY.M. It is about what happened. Yes.\r\n\r\nO.M. What a handsome job of self-sacrificing he did do! It seems to me\r\nthat he sacrificed everybody _except_ himself. Haven't I told you that\r\nno man _ever_ sacrifices himself; that there is no instance of it upon\r\nrecord anywhere; and that when a man's Interior Monarch requires a thing\r\nof its slave for either its _momentary_ or its _permanent_ contentment,\r\nthat thing must and will be furnished and that command obeyed, no matter\r\nwho may stand in the way and suffer disaster by it? That man _ruined his\r\nfamily_ to please and content his Interior Monarch--\r\n\r\nY.M. And help Christ's cause.\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes--_secondly_. Not firstly. _He_ thought it was firstly.\r\n\r\nY.M. Very well, have it so, if you will. But it could be that he argued\r\nthat if he saved a hundred souls in New York--\r\n\r\nO.M. The sacrifice of the _family_ would be justified by that great\r\nprofit upon the--the--what shall we call it?\r\n\r\nY.M. Investment?\r\n\r\nO.M. Hardly. How would _speculation_ do? How would _gamble_ do? Not\r\na solitary soul-capture was sure. He played for a possible\r\nthirty-three-hundred-per-cent profit. It was _gambling_--with his\r\nfamily for \"chips.\" However let us see how the game came out. Maybe we\r\ncan get on the track of the secret original impulse, the _real_ impulse,\r\nthat moved him to so nobly self--sacrifice his family in the Savior's\r\ncause under the superstition that he was sacrificing himself. I will\r\nread a chapter or so.... Here we have it! It was bound to expose itself\r\nsooner or later. He preached to the East-Side rabble a season, then went\r\nback to his old dull, obscure life in the lumber-camps \"_hurt to the\r\nheart, his pride humbled_.\" Why? Were not his efforts acceptable to the\r\nSavior, for Whom alone they were made? Dear me, that detail is _lost\r\nsight of_, is not even referred to, the fact that it started out as a\r\nmotive is entirely forgotten! Then what is the trouble? The authoress\r\nquite innocently and unconsciously gives the whole business away. The\r\ntrouble was this: this man merely _preached_ to the poor; that is not\r\nthe University Settlement's way; it deals in larger and better things\r\nthan that, and it did not enthuse over that crude Salvation-Army\r\neloquence. It was courteous to Holme--but cool. It did not pet him,\r\ndid not take him to its bosom. \"_Perished were all his dreams of\r\ndistinction, the praise and grateful approval_--\" Of whom? The\r\nSavior? No; the Savior is not mentioned. Of whom, then? Of \"his\r\n_fellow-workers_.\" Why did he want that? Because the Master inside of\r\nhim wanted it, and would not be content without it. That emphasized\r\nsentence quoted above, reveals the secret we have been seeking, the\r\noriginal impulse, the _real_ impulse, which moved the obscure and\r\nunappreciated Adirondack lumberman to sacrifice his family and go on\r\nthat crusade to the East Side--which said original impulse was this,\r\nto wit: without knowing it _he went there to show a neglected world the\r\nlarge talent that was in him, and rise to distinction_. As I have warned\r\nyou before, _no_ act springs from any but the one law, the one motive.\r\nBut I pray you, do not accept this law upon my say-so; but diligently\r\nexamine for yourself. Whenever you read of a self-sacrificing act or\r\nhear of one, or of a duty done for _duty's sake_, take it to pieces and\r\nlook for the _real_ motive. It is always there.\r\n\r\nY.M. I do it every day. I cannot help it, now that I have gotten\r\nstarted upon the degrading and exasperating quest. For it is hatefully\r\ninteresting!--in fact, fascinating is the word. As soon as I come across\r\na golden deed in a book I have to stop and take it apart and examine it,\r\nI cannot help myself.\r\n\r\nO.M. Have you ever found one that defeated the rule?\r\n\r\nY.M. No--at least, not yet. But take the case of servant--tipping in\r\nEurope. You pay the _hotel_ for service; you owe the servants _nothing_,\r\nyet you pay them besides. Doesn't that defeat it?\r\n\r\nO.M. In what way?\r\n\r\nY.M. You are not _obliged_ to do it, therefore its source is compassion\r\nfor their ill-paid condition, and--\r\n\r\nO.M. Has that custom ever vexed you, annoyed you, irritated you?\r\n\r\nY.M. Well, yes.\r\n\r\nO.M. Still you succumbed to it?\r\n\r\nY.M. Of course.\r\n\r\nO.M. Why of course?\r\n\r\nY.M. Well, custom is law, in a way, and laws must be submitted\r\nto--everybody recognizes it as a _duty_.\r\n\r\nO.M. Then you pay for the irritating tax for _duty's_ sake?\r\n\r\nY.M. I suppose it amounts to that.\r\n\r\nO.M. Then the impulse which moves you to submit to the tax is not _all_\r\ncompassion, charity, benevolence?\r\n\r\nY.M. Well--perhaps not.\r\n\r\nO.M. Is _any_ of it?\r\n\r\nY.M. I--perhaps I was too hasty in locating its source.\r\n\r\nO.M. Perhaps so. In case you ignored the custom would you get prompt and\r\neffective service from the servants?\r\n\r\nY.M. Oh, hear yourself talk! Those European servants? Why, you wouldn't\r\nget any at all, to speak of.\r\n\r\nO.M. Couldn't _that_ work as an impulse to move you to pay the tax?\r\n\r\nY.M. I am not denying it.\r\n\r\nO.M. Apparently, then, it is a case of for-duty's-sake with a little\r\nself-interest added?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes, it has the look of it. But here is a point: we pay that tax\r\nknowing it to be unjust and an extortion; yet we go away with a pain at\r\nthe heart if we think we have been stingy with the poor fellows; and we\r\nheartily wish we were back again, so that we could do the right thing,\r\nand _more_ than the right thing, the _generous_ thing. I think it will\r\nbe difficult for you to find any thought of self in that impulse.\r\n\r\nO.M. I wonder why you should think so. When you find service charged in\r\nthe _hotel_ bill does it annoy you?\r\n\r\nY.M. No.\r\n\r\nO.M. Do you ever complain of the amount of it?\r\n\r\nY.M. No, it would not occur to me.\r\n\r\nO.M. The _expense_, then, is not the annoying detail. It is a fixed\r\ncharge, and you pay it cheerfully, you pay it without a murmur. When you\r\ncame to pay the servants, how would you like it if each of the men and\r\nmaids had a fixed charge?\r\n\r\nY.M. Like it? I should rejoice!\r\n\r\nO.M. Even if the fixed tax were a shade _more_ than you had been in the\r\nhabit of paying in the form of tips?\r\n\r\nY.M. Indeed, yes!\r\n\r\nO.M. Very well, then. As I understand it, it isn't really compassion nor\r\nyet duty that moves you to pay the tax, and it isn't the _amount_ of the\r\ntax that annoys you. Yet _something_ annoys you. What is it?\r\n\r\nY.M. Well, the trouble is, you never know _what_ to pay, the tax varies\r\nso, all over Europe.\r\n\r\nO.M. So you have to guess?\r\n\r\nY.M. There is no other way. So you go on thinking and thinking, and\r\ncalculating and guessing, and consulting with other people and getting\r\ntheir views; and it spoils your sleep nights, and makes you distraught\r\nin the daytime, and while you are pretending to look at the sights you\r\nare only guessing and guessing and guessing all the time, and being\r\nworried and miserable.\r\n\r\nO.M. And all about a debt which you don't owe and don't have to pay\r\nunless you want to! Strange. What is the purpose of the guessing?\r\n\r\nY.M. To guess out what is right to give them, and not be unfair to any\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nO.M. It has quite a noble look--taking so much pains and using up so\r\nmuch valuable time in order to be just and fair to a poor servant to\r\nwhom you owe nothing, but who needs money and is ill paid.\r\n\r\nY.M. I think, myself, that if there is any ungracious motive back of it\r\nit will be hard to find.\r\n\r\nO.M. How do you know when you have not paid a servant fairly?\r\n\r\nY.M. Why, he is silent; does not thank you. Sometimes he gives you a\r\nlook that makes you ashamed. You are too proud to rectify your mistake\r\nthere, with people looking, but afterward you keep on wishing and\r\nwishing you _had_ done it. My, the shame and the pain of it! Sometimes\r\nyou see, by the signs, that you have it _just right_, and you go away\r\nmightily satisfied. Sometimes the man is so effusively thankful that you\r\nknow you have given him a good deal _more_ than was necessary.\r\n\r\nO.M. _Necessary_? Necessary for what?\r\n\r\nY.M. To content him.\r\n\r\nO.M. How do you feel _then_?\r\n\r\nY.M. Repentant.\r\n\r\nO.M. It is my belief that you have _not_ been concerning yourself\r\nin guessing out his just dues, but only in ciphering out what would\r\n_content_ him. And I think you have a self-deluding reason for that.\r\n\r\nY.M. What was it?\r\n\r\nO.M. If you fell short of what he was expecting and wanting, you would\r\nget a look which would _shame you before folk_. That would give you\r\n_pain_. _You_--for you are only working for yourself, not _him_. If you\r\ngave him too much you would be _ashamed of yourself_ for it, and\r\nthat would give _you_ pain--another case of thinking of _yourself_,\r\nprotecting yourself, _saving yourself from discomfort_. You never think\r\nof the servant once--except to guess out how to get _his approval_. If\r\nyou get that, you get your _own _approval, and that is the sole and\r\nonly thing you are after. The Master inside of you is then satisfied,\r\ncontented, comfortable; there was _no other_ thing at stake, as a matter\r\nof _first_ interest, anywhere in the transaction.\r\n\r\n_Further Instances_\r\n\r\nY.M. Well, to think of it; Self-Sacrifice for others, the grandest thing\r\nin man, ruled out! non-existent!\r\n\r\nO.M. Are you accusing me of saying that?\r\n\r\nY.M. Why, certainly.\r\n\r\nO.M. I haven't said it.\r\n\r\nY.M. What did you say, then?\r\n\r\nO.M. That no man has ever sacrificed himself in the common meaning of\r\nthat phrase--which is, self-sacrifice for another _alone_. Men make\r\ndaily sacrifices for others, but it is for their own sake _first_. The\r\nact must content their own spirit _first_. The other beneficiaries come\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nY.M. And the same with duty for duty's sake?\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes. No man performs a duty for mere duty's sake; the act must\r\ncontent his spirit _first_. He must feel better for _doing_ the duty\r\nthan he would for shirking it. Otherwise he will not do it.\r\n\r\nY.M. Take the case of the _Berkeley Castle_.\r\n\r\nO.M. It was a noble duty, greatly performed. Take it to pieces and\r\nexamine it, if you like.\r\n\r\nY.M. A British troop-ship crowded with soldiers and their wives and\r\nchildren. She struck a rock and began to sink. There was room in the\r\nboats for the women and children only. The colonel lined up his regiment\r\non the deck and said \"it is our duty to die, that they may be saved.\"\r\nThere was no murmur, no protest. The boats carried away the women and\r\nchildren. When the death-moment was come, the colonel and his officers\r\ntook their several posts, the men stood at shoulder-arms, and so, as on\r\ndress-parade, with their flag flying and the drums beating, they went\r\ndown, a sacrifice to duty for duty's sake. Can you view it as other than\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nO.M. It was something as fine as that, as exalted as that. Could\r\nyou have remained in those ranks and gone down to your death in that\r\nunflinching way?\r\n\r\nY.M. Could I? No, I could not.\r\n\r\nO.M. Think. Imagine yourself there, with that watery doom creeping\r\nhigher and higher around you.\r\n\r\nY.M. I can imagine it. I feel all the horror of it. I could not have\r\nendured it, I could not have remained in my place. I know it.\r\n\r\nO.M. Why?\r\n\r\nY.M. There is no why about it: I know myself, and I know I couldn't _do_\r\nit.\r\n\r\nO.M. But it would be your _duty_ to do it.\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes, I know--but I couldn't.\r\n\r\nO.M. It was more than thousand men, yet not one of them flinched. Some\r\nof them must have been born with your temperament; if they could do that\r\ngreat duty for duty's _sake_, why not you? Don't you know that you could\r\ngo out and gather together a thousand clerks and mechanics and put them\r\non that deck and ask them to die for duty's sake, and not two dozen of\r\nthem would stay in the ranks to the end?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes, I know that.\r\n\r\nO.M. But you _train_ them, and put them through a campaign or two; then\r\nthey would be soldiers; soldiers, with a soldier's pride, a soldier's\r\nself-respect, a soldier's ideals. They would have to content a\r\n_soldier's_ spirit then, not a clerk's, not a mechanic's. They could not\r\ncontent that spirit by shirking a soldier's duty, could they?\r\n\r\nY.M. I suppose not.\r\n\r\nO.M. Then they would do the duty not for the _duty's_ sake, but for\r\ntheir _own _sake--primarily. The _duty_ was _just the same_, and just\r\nas imperative, when they were clerks, mechanics, raw recruits, but they\r\nwouldn't perform it for that. As clerks and mechanics they had other\r\nideals, another spirit to satisfy, and they satisfied it. They _had_ to;\r\nit is the law. _Training _is potent. Training toward higher and\r\nhigher, and ever higher ideals is worth any man's thought and labor and\r\ndiligence.\r\n\r\nY.M. Consider the man who stands by his duty and goes to the stake\r\nrather than be recreant to it.\r\n\r\nO.M. It is his make and his training. He has to content the spirit that\r\nis in him, though it cost him his life. Another man, just as sincerely\r\nreligious, but of different temperament, will fail of that duty, though\r\nrecognizing it as a duty, and grieving to be unequal to it: but he\r\nmust content the spirit that is in him--he cannot help it. He could\r\nnot perform that duty for duty's _sake_, for that would not content his\r\nspirit, and the contenting of his spirit must be looked to _first_. It\r\ntakes precedence of all other duties.\r\n\r\nY.M. Take the case of a clergyman of stainless private morals who votes\r\nfor a thief for public office, on his own party's ticket, and against an\r\nhonest man on the other ticket.\r\n\r\nO.M. He has to content his spirit. He has no public morals; he has no\r\nprivate ones, where his party's prosperity is at stake. He will always\r\nbe true to his make and training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nYoung Man. You keep using that word--training. By it do you particularly\r\nmean--\r\n\r\nOld Man. Study, instruction, lectures, sermons? That is a part of\r\nit--but not a large part. I mean _all _the outside influences. There are\r\na million of them. From the cradle to the grave, during all his waking\r\nhours, the human being is under training. In the very first rank of\r\nhis trainers stands _association_. It is his human environment which\r\ninfluences his mind and his feelings, furnishes him his ideals, and sets\r\nhim on his road and keeps him in it. If he leave[s] that road he will\r\nfind himself shunned by the people whom he most loves and esteems, and\r\nwhose approval he most values. He is a chameleon; by the law of his\r\nnature he takes the color of his place of resort. The influences about\r\nhim create his preferences, his aversions, his politics, his tastes, his\r\nmorals, his religion. He creates none of these things for himself.\r\nHe _thinks _he does, but that is because he has not examined into the\r\nmatter. You have seen Presbyterians?\r\n\r\nY.M. Many.\r\n\r\nO.M. How did they happen to be Presbyterians and not Congregationalists?\r\nAnd why were the Congregationalists not Baptists, and the Baptists Roman\r\nCatholics, and the Roman Catholics Buddhists, and the Buddhists Quakers,\r\nand the Quakers Episcopalians, and the Episcopalians Millerites and\r\nthe Millerites Hindus, and the Hindus Atheists, and the Atheists\r\nSpiritualists, and the Spiritualists Agnostics, and the Agnostics\r\nMethodists, and the Methodists Confucians, and the Confucians\r\nUnitarians, and the Unitarians Mohammedans, and the Mohammedans\r\nSalvation Warriors, and the Salvation Warriors Zoroastrians, and\r\nthe Zoroastrians Christian Scientists, and the Christian Scientists\r\nMormons--and so on?\r\n\r\nY.M. You may answer your question yourself.\r\n\r\nO.M. That list of sects is not a record of _studies_, searchings,\r\nseekings after light; it mainly (and sarcastically) indicates what\r\n_association _can do. If you know a man's nationality you can come\r\nwithin a split hair of guessing the complexion of his religion:\r\nEnglish--Protestant; American--ditto; Spaniard, Frenchman, Irishman,\r\nItalian, South American--Roman Catholic; Russian--Greek Catholic;\r\nTurk--Mohammedan; and so on. And when you know the man's religious\r\ncomplexion, you know what sort of religious books he reads when he wants\r\nsome more light, and what sort of books he avoids, lest by accident he\r\nget more light than he wants. In America if you know which party-collar\r\na voter wears, you know what his associations are, and how he came by\r\nhis politics, and which breed of newspaper he reads to get light, and\r\nwhich breed he diligently avoids, and which breed of mass-meetings he\r\nattends in order to broaden his political knowledge, and which breed\r\nof mass-meetings he doesn't attend, except to refute its doctrines with\r\nbrickbats. We are always hearing of people who are around _seeking after\r\ntruth_. I have never seen a (permanent) specimen. I think he had never\r\nlived. But I have seen several entirely sincere people who _thought\r\n_they were (permanent) Seekers after Truth. They sought diligently,\r\npersistently, carefully, cautiously, profoundly, with perfect honesty\r\nand nicely adjusted judgment--until they believed that without doubt or\r\nquestion they had found the Truth. _That was the end of the search. _The\r\nman spent the rest of his life hunting up shingles wherewith to protect\r\nhis Truth from the weather. If he was seeking after political Truth he\r\nfound it in one or another of the hundred political gospels which govern\r\nmen in the earth; if he was seeking after the Only True Religion he\r\nfound it in one or another of the three thousand that are on the market.\r\nIn any case, when he found the Truth _he sought no further; _but from\r\nthat day forth, with his soldering-iron in one hand and his bludgeon in\r\nthe other he tinkered its leaks and reasoned with objectors. There have\r\nbeen innumerable Temporary Seekers of Truth--have you ever heard of a\r\npermanent one? In the very nature of man such a person is impossible.\r\nHowever, to drop back to the text--training: all training is one form\r\nor another of _outside influence, _and _association _is the largest part\r\nof it. A man is never anything but what his outside influences have made\r\nhim. They train him downward or they train him upward--but they _train\r\n_him; they are at work upon him all the time.\r\n\r\nY.M. Then if he happen by the accidents of life to be evilly placed\r\nthere is no help for him, according to your notions--he must train\r\ndownward.\r\n\r\nO.M. No help for him? No help for this chameleon? It is a mistake. It is\r\nin his chameleonship that his greatest good fortune lies. He has only\r\nto change his habitat--his _associations_. But the impulse to do it\r\nmust come from the _outside _--he cannot originate it himself, with that\r\npurpose in view. Sometimes a very small and accidental thing can furnish\r\nhim the initiatory impulse and start him on a new road, with a new idea.\r\nThe chance remark of a sweetheart, \"I hear that you are a coward,\" may\r\nwater a seed that shall sprout and bloom and flourish, and ended in\r\nproducing a surprising fruitage--in the fields of war. The history of\r\nman is full of such accidents. The accident of a broken leg brought a\r\nprofane and ribald soldier under religious influences and furnished him\r\na new ideal. From that accident sprang the Order of the Jesuits, and it\r\nhas been shaking thrones, changing policies, and doing other tremendous\r\nwork for two hundred years--and will go on. The chance reading of a book\r\nor of a paragraph in a newspaper can start a man on a new track and\r\nmake him renounce his old associations and seek new ones that are _in\r\nsympathy with his new ideal_: and the result, for that man, can be an\r\nentire change of his way of life.\r\n\r\nY.M. Are you hinting at a scheme of procedure?\r\n\r\nO.M. Not a new one--an old one. Old as mankind.\r\n\r\nY.M. What is it?\r\n\r\nO.M. Merely the laying of traps for people. Traps baited\r\nwith _initiatory impulses toward high ideals. _It is what the\r\ntract-distributor does. It is what the missionary does. It is what\r\ngovernments ought to do.\r\n\r\nY.M. Don't they?\r\n\r\nO.M. In one way they do, in another they don't. They separate the\r\nsmallpox patients from the healthy people, but in dealing with crime\r\nthey put the healthy into the pest-house along with the sick. That is to\r\nsay, they put the beginners in with the confirmed criminals. This would\r\nbe well if man were naturally inclined to good, but he isn't, and so\r\n_association _makes the beginners worse than they were when they\r\nwent into captivity. It is putting a very severe punishment upon the\r\ncomparatively innocent at times. They hang a man--which is a trifling\r\npunishment; this breaks the hearts of his family--which is a heavy one.\r\nThey comfortably jail and feed a wife-beater, and leave his innocent\r\nwife and family to starve.\r\n\r\nY.M. Do you believe in the doctrine that man is equipped with an\r\nintuitive perception of good and evil?\r\n\r\nO.M. Adam hadn't it.\r\n\r\nY.M. But has man acquired it since?\r\n\r\nO.M. No. I think he has no intuitions of any kind. He gets _all _his\r\nideas, all his impressions, from the outside. I keep repeating this, in\r\nthe hope that I may impress it upon you that you will be interested to\r\nobserve and examine for yourself and see whether it is true or false.\r\n\r\nY.M. Where did you get your own aggravating notions?\r\n\r\nO.M. From the _outside_. I did not invent them. They are gathered from a\r\nthousand unknown sources. Mainly _unconsciously _gathered.\r\n\r\nY.M. Don't you believe that God could make an inherently honest man?\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes, I know He could. I also know that He never did make one.\r\n\r\nY.M. A wiser observer than you has recorded the fact that \"an honest\r\nman's the noblest work of God.\"\r\n\r\nO.M. He didn't record a fact, he recorded a falsity. It is windy,\r\nand sounds well, but it is not true. God makes a man with honest\r\nand dishonest _possibilities _in him and stops there. The man's\r\n_associations _develop the possibilities--the one set or the other. The\r\nresult is accordingly an honest man or a dishonest one.\r\n\r\nY.M. And the honest one is not entitled to--\r\n\r\nO.M. Praise? No. How often must I tell you that? _He _is not the\r\narchitect of his honesty.\r\n\r\nY.M. Now then, I will ask you where there is any sense in training\r\npeople to lead virtuous lives. What is gained by it?\r\n\r\nO.M. The man himself gets large advantages out of it, and that is the\r\nmain thing--to _him_. He is not a peril to his neighbors, he is not a\r\ndamage to them--and so _they _get an advantage out of his virtues.\r\nThat is the main thing to _them_. It can make this life comparatively\r\ncomfortable to the parties concerned; the _neglect _of this training can\r\nmake this life a constant peril and distress to the parties concerned.\r\n\r\nY.M. You have said that training is everything; that training is the man\r\n_himself_, for it makes him what he is.\r\n\r\nO.M. I said training and _another _thing. Let that other thing pass, for\r\nthe moment. What were you going to say?\r\n\r\nY.M. We have an old servant. She has been with us twenty--two years. Her\r\nservice used to be faultless, but now she has become very forgetful. We\r\nare all fond of her; we all recognize that she cannot help the infirmity\r\nwhich age has brought her; the rest of the family do not scold her for\r\nher remissnesses, but at times I do--I can't seem to control myself.\r\nDon't I try? I do try. Now, then, when I was ready to dress, this\r\nmorning, no clean clothes had been put out. I lost my temper; I lose it\r\neasiest and quickest in the early morning. I rang; and immediately began\r\nto warn myself not to show temper, and to be careful and speak gently.\r\nI safe-guarded myself most carefully. I even chose the very word I would\r\nuse: \"You've forgotten the clean clothes, Jane.\" When she appeared in\r\nthe door I opened my mouth to say that phrase--and out of it, moved by\r\nan instant surge of passion which I was not expecting and hadn't time to\r\nput under control, came the hot rebuke, \"You've forgotten them again!\"\r\nYou say a man always does the thing which will best please his Interior\r\nMaster. Whence came the impulse to make careful preparation to save the\r\ngirl the humiliation of a rebuke? Did that come from the Master, who is\r\nalways primarily concerned about _himself_?\r\n\r\nO.M. Unquestionably. There is no other source for any impulse.\r\n_Secondarily _you made preparation to save the girl, but _primarily _its\r\nobject was to save yourself, by contenting the Master.\r\n\r\nY.M. How do you mean?\r\n\r\nO.M. Has any member of the family ever implored you to watch your temper\r\nand not fly out at the girl?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes. My mother.\r\n\r\nO.M. You love her?\r\n\r\nY.M. Oh, more than that!\r\n\r\nO.M. You would always do anything in your power to please her?\r\n\r\nY.M. It is a delight to me to do anything to please her!\r\n\r\nO.M. Why? _You would do it for pay, solely _--for _profit_. What profit\r\nwould you expect and certainly receive from the investment?\r\n\r\nY.M. Personally? None. To please _her _is enough.\r\n\r\nO.M. It appears, then, that your object, primarily, _wasn't _to save the\r\ngirl a humiliation, but to _please your mother. _It also appears that to\r\nplease your mother gives _you _a strong pleasure. Is not that the profit\r\nwhich you get out of the investment? Isn't that the _real _profits and\r\n_first _profit?\r\n\r\nY.M. Oh, well? Go on.\r\n\r\nO.M. In _all _transactions, the Interior Master looks to it that _you\r\nget the first profit. _Otherwise there is no transaction.\r\n\r\nY.M. Well, then, if I was so anxious to get that profit and so intent\r\nupon it, why did I throw it away by losing my temper?\r\n\r\nO.M. In order to get _another _profit which suddenly superseded it in\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nY.M. Where was it?\r\n\r\nO.M. Ambushed behind your born temperament, and waiting for a chance.\r\nYour native warm temper suddenly jumped to the front, and _for the\r\nmoment its influence _was more powerful than your mother's, and\r\nabolished it. In that instance you were eager to flash out a hot rebuke\r\nand enjoy it. You did enjoy it, didn't you?\r\n\r\nY.M. For--for a quarter of a second. Yes--I did.\r\n\r\nO.M. Very well, it is as I have said: the thing which will give you the\r\n_most _pleasure, the most satisfaction, in any moment or _fraction _of\r\na moment, is the thing you will always do. You must content the Master's\r\n_latest _whim, whatever it may be.\r\n\r\nY.M. But when the tears came into the old servant's eyes I could have\r\ncut my hand off for what I had done.\r\n\r\nO.M. Right. You had humiliated _yourself_, you see, you had given\r\nyourself _pain_. Nothing is of _first _importance to a man except\r\nresults which damage _him _or profit him--all the rest is _secondary_.\r\nYour Master was displeased with you, although you had obeyed him. He\r\nrequired a prompt _repentance_; you obeyed again; you_ had _to--there is\r\nnever any escape from his commands. He is a hard master and fickle; he\r\nchanges his mind in the fraction of a second, but you must be ready\r\nto obey, and you will obey, _always_. If he requires repentance, you\r\ncontent him, you will always furnish it. He must be nursed, petted,\r\ncoddled, and kept contented, let the terms be what they may.\r\n\r\nY.M. Training! Oh, what's the use of it? Didn't I, and didn't my mother\r\ntry to train me up to where I would no longer fly out at that girl?\r\n\r\nO.M. Have you never managed to keep back a scolding?\r\n\r\nY.M. Oh, certainly--many times.\r\n\r\nO.M. More times this year than last?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes, a good many more.\r\n\r\nO.M. More times last year than the year before?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes.\r\n\r\nO.M. There is a large improvement, then, in the two years?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes, undoubtedly.\r\n\r\nO.M. Then your question is answered. You see there _is _use in training.\r\nKeep on. Keeping faithfully on. You are doing well.\r\n\r\nY.M. Will my reform reach perfection?\r\n\r\nO.M. It will. Up to _your _limit.\r\n\r\nY.M. My limit? What do you mean by that?\r\n\r\nO.M. You remember that you said that I said training was _everything_. I\r\ncorrected you, and said \"training and _another _thing.\" That other thing\r\nis _temperament _--that is, the disposition you were born with. _You\r\ncan't eradicate your disposition nor any rag of it _--you can only put a\r\npressure on it and keep it down and quiet. You have a warm temper?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes.\r\n\r\nO.M. You will never get rid of it; but by watching it you can keep it\r\ndown nearly all the time. _Its presence is your limit. _Your reform\r\nwill never quite reach perfection, for your temper will beat you now and\r\nthen, but you come near enough. You have made valuable progress and can\r\nmake more. There _is _use in training. Immense use. Presently you will\r\nreach a new stage of development, then your progress will be easier;\r\nwill proceed on a simpler basis, anyway.\r\n\r\nY.M. Explain.\r\n\r\nO.M. You keep back your scoldings now, to please _yourself _by pleasing\r\nyour _mother_; presently the mere triumphing over your temper\r\nwill delight your vanity and confer a more delicious pleasure and\r\nsatisfaction upon you than even the approbation of your _mother _confers\r\nupon you now. You will then labor for yourself directly and at _first\r\nhand, _not by the roundabout way through your mother. It simplifies the\r\nmatter, and it also strengthens the impulse.\r\n\r\nY.M. Ah, dear! But I sha'n't ever reach the point where I will spare the\r\ngirl for _her _sake _primarily_, not mine?\r\n\r\nO.M. Why--yes. In heaven.\r\n\r\nY.M. (_After a reflective pause) _Temperament. Well, I see one must\r\nallow for temperament. It is a large factor, sure enough. My mother is\r\nthoughtful, and not hot-tempered. When I was dressed I went to her room;\r\nshe was not there; I called, she answered from the bathroom. I heard the\r\nwater running. I inquired. She answered, without temper, that Jane had\r\nforgotten her bath, and she was preparing it herself. I offered to\r\nring, but she said, \"No, don't do that; it would only distress her to\r\nbe confronted with her lapse, and would be a rebuke; she doesn't deserve\r\nthat--she is not to blame for the tricks her memory serves her.\" I\r\nsay--has my mother an Interior Master?--and where was he?\r\n\r\nO.M. He was there. There, and looking out for his own peace and pleasure\r\nand contentment. The girl's distress would have pained _your mother.\r\n_Otherwise the girl would have been rung up, distress and all. I know\r\nwomen who would have gotten a No. 1 _pleasure _out of ringing Jane\r\nup--and so they would infallibly have pushed the button and obeyed the\r\nlaw of their make and training, which are the servants of their Interior\r\nMasters. It is quite likely that a part of your mother's forbearance\r\ncame from training. The _good _kind of training--whose best and highest\r\nfunction is to see to it that every time it confers a satisfaction upon\r\nits pupil a benefit shall fall at second hand upon others.\r\n\r\nY.M. If you were going to condense into an admonition your plan for the\r\ngeneral betterment of the race's condition, how would you word it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Admonition_\r\n\r\nO.M. Diligently train your ideals _upward _and _still upward _toward\r\na summit where you will find your chiefest pleasure in conduct which,\r\nwhile contenting you, will be sure to confer benefits upon your neighbor\r\nand the community.\r\n\r\nY.M. Is that a new gospel?\r\n\r\nO.M. No.\r\n\r\nY.M. It has been taught before?\r\n\r\nO.M. For ten thousand years.\r\n\r\nY.M. By whom?\r\n\r\nO.M. All the great religions--all the great gospels.\r\n\r\nY.M. Then there is nothing new about it?\r\n\r\nO.M. Oh yes, there is. It is candidly stated, this time. That has not\r\nbeen done before.\r\n\r\nY.M. How do you mean?\r\n\r\nO.M. Haven't I put _you first, _and your neighbor and the community\r\nafterward?\r\n\r\nY.M. Well, yes, that is a difference, it is true.\r\n\r\nO.M. The difference between straight speaking and crooked; the\r\ndifference between frankness and shuffling.\r\n\r\nY.M. Explain.\r\n\r\nO.M. The others offer you a hundred bribes to be good, thus conceding\r\nthat the Master inside of you must be conciliated and contented first,\r\nand that you will do nothing at _first hand _but for his sake; then\r\nthey turn square around and require you to do good for _other's _sake\r\n_chiefly_; and to do your duty for duty's _sake_, chiefly; and to do\r\nacts of _self_-_sacrifice_. Thus at the outset we all stand upon the\r\nsame ground--recognition of the supreme and absolute Monarch that\r\nresides in man, and we all grovel before him and appeal to him; then\r\nthose others dodge and shuffle, and face around and unfrankly and\r\ninconsistently and illogically change the form of their appeal and\r\ndirect its persuasions to man's _second-place _powers and to powers\r\nwhich have _no existence _in him, thus advancing them to _first _place;\r\nwhereas in my Admonition I stick logically and consistently to the\r\noriginal position: I place the Interior Master's requirements _first_,\r\nand keep them there.\r\n\r\nY.M. If we grant, for the sake of argument, that your scheme and the\r\nother schemes aim at and produce the same result--_right living--_has\r\nyours an advantage over the others?\r\n\r\nO.M. One, yes--a large one. It has no concealments, no deceptions. When\r\na man leads a right and valuable life under it he is not deceived as to\r\nthe _real _chief motive which impels him to it--in those other cases he\r\nis.\r\n\r\nY.M. Is that an advantage? Is it an advantage to live a lofty life for\r\na mean reason? In the other cases he lives the lofty life under the\r\n_impression _that he is living for a lofty reason. Is not that an\r\nadvantage?\r\n\r\nO.M. Perhaps so. The same advantage he might get out of thinking\r\nhimself a duke, and living a duke's life and parading in ducal fuss\r\nand feathers, when he wasn't a duke at all, and could find it out if he\r\nwould only examine the herald's records.\r\n\r\nY.M. But anyway, he is obliged to do a duke's part; he puts his hand in\r\nhis pocket and does his benevolences on as big a scale as he can stand,\r\nand that benefits the community.\r\n\r\nO.M. He could do that without being a duke.\r\n\r\nY.M. But would he?\r\n\r\nO.M. Don't you see where you are arriving?\r\n\r\nY.M. Where?\r\n\r\nO.M. At the standpoint of the other schemes: That it is good morals\r\nto let an ignorant duke do showy benevolences for his pride's sake, a\r\npretty low motive, and go on doing them unwarned, lest if he were made\r\nacquainted with the actual motive which prompted them he might shut up\r\nhis purse and cease to be good?\r\n\r\nY.M. But isn't it best to leave him in ignorance, as long as he _thinks\r\n_he is doing good for others' sake?\r\n\r\nO.M. Perhaps so. It is the position of the other schemes. They think\r\nhumbug is good enough morals when the dividend on it is good deeds and\r\nhandsome conduct.\r\n\r\nY.M. It is my opinion that under your scheme of a man's doing a good\r\ndeed for his _own _sake first-off, instead of first for the _good deed's\r\n_sake, no man would ever do one.\r\n\r\nO.M. Have you committed a benevolence lately?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes. This morning.\r\n\r\nO.M. Give the particulars.\r\n\r\nY.M. The cabin of the old negro woman who used to nurse me when I was a\r\nchild and who saved my life once at the risk of her own, was burned last\r\nnight, and she came mourning this morning, and pleading for money to\r\nbuild another one.\r\n\r\nO.M. You furnished it?\r\n\r\nY.M. Certainly.\r\n\r\nO.M. You were glad you had the money?\r\n\r\nY.M. Money? I hadn't. I sold my horse.\r\n\r\nO.M. You were glad you had the horse?\r\n\r\nY.M. Of course I was; for if I hadn't had the horse I should have been\r\nincapable, and my _mother _would have captured the chance to set old\r\nSally up.\r\n\r\nO.M. You were cordially glad you were not caught out and incapable?\r\n\r\nY.M. Oh, I just was!\r\n\r\nO.M. Now, then--\r\n\r\nY.M. Stop where you are! I know your whole catalog of questions, and\r\nI could answer every one of them without your wasting the time to ask\r\nthem; but I will summarize the whole thing in a single remark: I did\r\nthe charity knowing it was because the act would give _me _a splendid\r\npleasure, and because old Sally's moving gratitude and delight would\r\ngive _me _another one; and because the reflection that she would be\r\nhappy now and out of her trouble would fill _me _full of happiness. I\r\ndid the whole thing with my eyes open and recognizing and realizing that\r\nI was looking out for _my _share of the profits _first_. Now then, I\r\nhave confessed. Go on.\r\n\r\nO.M. I haven't anything to offer; you have covered the whole ground.\r\nCan you have been any _more _strongly moved to help Sally out of her\r\ntrouble--could you have done the deed any more eagerly--if you had been\r\nunder the delusion that you were doing it for _her _sake and profit\r\nonly?\r\n\r\nY.M. No! Nothing in the world could have made the impulse which moved\r\nme more powerful, more masterful, more thoroughly irresistible. I played\r\nthe limit!\r\n\r\nO.M. Very well. You begin to suspect--and I claim to _know _--that when\r\na man is a shade _more strongly moved _to do _one _of two things or\r\nof two dozen things than he is to do any one of the _others_, he will\r\ninfallibly do that _one _thing, be it good or be it evil; and if it be\r\ngood, not all the beguilements of all the casuistries can increase the\r\nstrength of the impulse by a single shade or add a shade to the comfort\r\nand contentment he will get out of the act.\r\n\r\nY.M. Then you believe that such tendency toward doing good as is in\r\nmen's hearts would not be diminished by the removal of the delusion that\r\ngood deeds are done primarily for the sake of No. 2 instead of for the\r\nsake of No. 1?\r\n\r\nO.M. That is what I fully believe.\r\n\r\nY.M. Doesn't it somehow seem to take from the dignity of the deed?\r\n\r\nO.M. If there is dignity in falsity, it does. It removes that.\r\n\r\nY.M. What is left for the moralists to do?\r\n\r\nO.M. Teach unreservedly what he already teaches with one side of his\r\nmouth and takes back with the other: Do right _for your own sake, _and\r\nbe happy in knowing that your _neighbor _will certainly share in the\r\nbenefits resulting.\r\n\r\nY.M. Repeat your Admonition.\r\n\r\nO.M. _Diligently train your ideals upward and still upward toward a\r\nsummit where you will find your chiefest pleasure in conduct which,\r\nwhile contenting you, will be sure to confer benefits upon your neighbor\r\nand the community._\r\n\r\nY.M. One's _every _act proceeds from _exterior influences_, you think?\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes.\r\n\r\nY.M. If I conclude to rob a person, I am not the _originator _of the\r\nidea, but it comes in from the _outside_? I see him handling money--for\r\ninstance--and _that _moves me to the crime?\r\n\r\nO.M. That, by itself? Oh, certainly not. It is merely the _latest\r\n_outside influence of a procession of preparatory influences stretching\r\nback over a period of years. No _single _outside influence can make a\r\nman do a thing which is at war with his training. The most it can do is\r\nto start his mind on a new tract and open it to the reception of _new\r\n_influences--as in the case of Ignatius Loyola. In time these influences\r\ncan train him to a point where it will be consonant with his new\r\ncharacter to yield to the _final _influence and do that thing. I will\r\nput the case in a form which will make my theory clear to you, I think.\r\nHere are two ingots of virgin gold. They shall represent a couple of\r\ncharacters which have been refined and perfected in the virtues by\r\nyears of diligent right training. Suppose you wanted to break down these\r\nstrong and well-compacted characters--what influence would you bring to\r\nbear upon the ingots?\r\n\r\nY.M. Work it out yourself. Proceed.\r\n\r\nO.M. Suppose I turn upon one of them a steam-jet during a long\r\nsuccession of hours. Will there be a result?\r\n\r\nY.M. None that I know of.\r\n\r\nO.M. Why?\r\n\r\nY.M. A steam-jet cannot break down such a substance.\r\n\r\nO.M. Very well. The steam is an _outside influence, _but it is\r\nineffective because the gold _takes no interest in it. _The ingot\r\nremains as it was. Suppose we add to the steam some quicksilver in a\r\nvaporized condition, and turn the jet upon the ingot, will there be an\r\ninstantaneous result?\r\n\r\nY.M. No.\r\n\r\nO.M. The _quicksilver _is an outside influence which gold (by its\r\npeculiar nature--say _temperament, disposition) cannot be indifferent\r\nto. _It stirs up the interest of the gold, although we do not perceive\r\nit; but a _single _application of the influence works no damage. Let\r\nus continue the application in a steady stream, and call each minute\r\na year. By the end of ten or twenty minutes--ten or twenty years--the\r\nlittle ingot is sodden with quicksilver, its virtues are gone, its\r\ncharacter is degraded. At last it is ready to yield to a temptation\r\nwhich it would have taken no notice of, ten or twenty years ago. We will\r\napply that temptation in the form of a pressure of my finger. You note\r\nthe result?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes; the ingot has crumbled to sand. I understand, now. It is not\r\nthe _single _outside influence that does the work, but only the _last\r\n_one of a long and disintegrating accumulation of them. I see, now, how\r\nmy _single _impulse to rob the man is not the one that makes me do it,\r\nbut only the _last _one of a preparatory series. You might illustrate\r\nwith a parable.\r\n\r\n_A Parable_\r\n\r\nO.M. I will. There was once a pair of New England boys--twins.\r\nThey were alike in good dispositions, feckless morals, and personal\r\nappearance. They were the models of the Sunday--school. At fifteen\r\nGeorge had the opportunity to go as cabin-boy in a whale-ship, and\r\nsailed away for the Pacific. Henry remained at home in the village. At\r\neighteen George was a sailor before the mast, and Henry was teacher of\r\nthe advanced Bible class. At twenty-two George, through fighting-habits\r\nand drinking-habits acquired at sea and in the sailor boarding-houses\r\nof the European and Oriental ports, was a common rough in Hong-Kong,\r\nand out of a job; and Henry was superintendent of the Sunday-school. At\r\ntwenty-six George was a wanderer, a tramp, and Henry was pastor of\r\nthe village church. Then George came home, and was Henry's guest. One\r\nevening a man passed by and turned down the lane, and Henry said, with\r\na pathetic smile, \"Without intending me a discomfort, that man is always\r\nkeeping me reminded of my pinching poverty, for he carries heaps of\r\nmoney about him, and goes by here every evening of his life.\" That\r\n_outside influence _--that remark--was enough for George, but _it\r\n_was not the one that made him ambush the man and rob him, it merely\r\nrepresented the eleven years' accumulation of such influences, and gave\r\nbirth to the act for which their long gestation had made preparation. It\r\nhad never entered the head of Henry to rob the man--his ingot had\r\nbeen subjected to clean steam only; but George's had been subjected to\r\nvaporized quicksilver.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nMore About the Machine\r\n\r\nNote.--When Mrs. W. asks how can a millionaire give a single dollar to\r\ncolleges and museums while one human being is destitute of bread, she\r\nhas answered her question herself. Her feeling for the poor shows\r\nthat she has a standard of benevolence; there she has conceded the\r\nmillionaire's privilege of having a standard; since she evidently\r\nrequires him to adopt her standard, she is by that act requiring herself\r\nto adopt his. The human being always looks down when he is examining\r\nanother person's standard; he never find one that he has to examine by\r\nlooking up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Man-Machine Again_\r\n\r\nYoung Man. You really think man is a mere machine?\r\n\r\nOld Man. I do.\r\n\r\nY.M. And that his mind works automatically and is independent of his\r\ncontrol--carries on thought on its own hook?\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes. It is diligently at work, unceasingly at work, during every\r\nwaking moment. Have you never tossed about all night, imploring,\r\nbeseeching, commanding your mind to stop work and let you go to\r\nsleep?--you who perhaps imagine that your mind is your servant and must\r\nobey your orders, think what you tell it to think, and stop when you\r\ntell it to stop. When it chooses to work, there is no way to keep it\r\nstill for an instant. The brightest man would not be able to supply it\r\nwith subjects if he had to hunt them up. If it needed the man's help it\r\nwould wait for him to give it work when he wakes in the morning.\r\n\r\nY.M. Maybe it does.\r\n\r\nO.M. No, it begins right away, before the man gets wide enough awake to\r\ngive it a suggestion. He may go to sleep saying, \"The moment I wake I\r\nwill think upon such and such a subject,\" but he will fail. His mind\r\nwill be too quick for him; by the time he has become nearly enough\r\nawake to be half conscious, he will find that it is already at work upon\r\nanother subject. Make the experiment and see.\r\n\r\nY.M. At any rate, he can make it stick to a subject if he wants to.\r\n\r\nO.M. Not if it find another that suits it better. As a rule it will\r\nlisten to neither a dull speaker nor a bright one. It refuses all\r\npersuasion. The dull speaker wearies it and sends it far away in idle\r\ndreams; the bright speaker throws out stimulating ideas which it goes\r\nchasing after and is at once unconscious of him and his talk. You cannot\r\nkeep your mind from wandering, if it wants to; it is master, not you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_After an Interval of Days_\r\n\r\nO.M. Now, dreams--but we will examine that later. Meantime, did you\r\ntry commanding your mind to wait for orders from you, and not do any\r\nthinking on its own hook?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes, I commanded it to stand ready to take orders when I should\r\nwake in the morning.\r\n\r\nO.M. Did it obey?\r\n\r\nY.M. No. It went to thinking of something of its own initiation, without\r\nwaiting for me. Also--as you suggested--at night I appointed a theme for\r\nit to begin on in the morning, and commanded it to begin on that one and\r\nno other.\r\n\r\nO.M. Did it obey?\r\n\r\nY.M. No.\r\n\r\nO.M. How many times did you try the experiment?\r\n\r\nY.M. Ten.\r\n\r\nO.M. How many successes did you score?\r\n\r\nY.M. Not one.\r\n\r\nO.M. It is as I have said: the mind is independent of the man. He has\r\nno control over it; it does as it pleases. It will take up a subject\r\nin spite of him; it will stick to it in spite of him; it will throw it\r\naside in spite of him. It is entirely independent of him.\r\n\r\nY.M. Go on. Illustrate.\r\n\r\nO.M. Do you know chess?\r\n\r\nY.M. I learned it a week ago.\r\n\r\nO.M. Did your mind go on playing the game all night that first night?\r\n\r\nY.M. Don't mention it!\r\n\r\nO.M. It was eagerly, unsatisfiably interested; it rioted in the\r\ncombinations; you implored it to drop the game and let you get some\r\nsleep?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes. It wouldn't listen; it played right along. It wore me out and\r\nI got up haggard and wretched in the morning.\r\n\r\nO.M. At some time or other you have been captivated by a ridiculous\r\nrhyme-jingle?\r\n\r\nY.M. Indeed, yes!\r\n\r\n \"I saw Esau kissing Kate,\r\n\r\n And she saw I saw Esau;\r\n\r\n I saw Esau, he saw Kate,\r\n\r\n And she saw--\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so on. My mind went mad with joy over it. It repeated it all day\r\nand all night for a week in spite of all I could do to stop it, and it\r\nseemed to me that I must surely go crazy.\r\n\r\nO.M. And the new popular song?\r\n\r\nY.M. Oh yes! \"In the Swee-eet By and By\"; etc. Yes, the new popular song\r\nwith the taking melody sings through one's head day and night, asleep\r\nand awake, till one is a wreck. There is no getting the mind to let it\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes, asleep as well as awake. The mind is quite independent. It is\r\nmaster. You have nothing to do with it. It is so apart from you that\r\nit can conduct its affairs, sing its songs, play its chess, weave its\r\ncomplex and ingeniously constructed dreams, while you sleep. It has\r\nno use for your help, no use for your guidance, and never uses either,\r\nwhether you be asleep or awake. You have imagined that you could\r\noriginate a thought in your mind, and you have sincerely believed you\r\ncould do it.\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes, I have had that idea.\r\n\r\nO.M. Yet you can't originate a dream-thought for it to work out, and get\r\nit accepted?\r\n\r\nY.M. No.\r\n\r\nO.M. And you can't dictate its procedure after it has originated a\r\ndream-thought for itself?\r\n\r\nY.M. No. No one can do it. Do you think the waking mind and the dream\r\nmind are the same machine?\r\n\r\nO.M. There is argument for it. We have wild and fantastic day-thoughts?\r\nThings that are dream-like?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes--like Mr. Wells's man who invented a drug that made him\r\ninvisible; and like the Arabian tales of the Thousand Nights.\r\n\r\nO.M. And there are dreams that are rational, simple, consistent, and\r\nunfantastic?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes. I have dreams that are like that. Dreams that are just like\r\nreal life; dreams in which there are several persons with distinctly\r\ndifferentiated characters--inventions of my mind and yet strangers\r\nto me: a vulgar person; a refined one; a wise person; a fool; a\r\ncruel person; a kind and compassionate one; a quarrelsome person; a\r\npeacemaker; old persons and young; beautiful girls and homely ones. They\r\ntalk in character, each preserves his own characteristics. There are\r\nvivid fights, vivid and biting insults, vivid love-passages; there are\r\ntragedies and comedies, there are griefs that go to one's heart, there\r\nare sayings and doings that make you laugh: indeed, the whole thing is\r\nexactly like real life.\r\n\r\nO.M. Your dreaming mind originates the scheme, consistently and\r\nartistically develops it, and carries the little drama creditably\r\nthrough--all without help or suggestion from you?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes.\r\n\r\nO.M. It is argument that it could do the like awake without help or\r\nsuggestion from you--and I think it does. It is argument that it is the\r\nsame old mind in both cases, and never needs your help. I think the\r\nmind is purely a machine, a thoroughly independent machine, an automatic\r\nmachine. Have you tried the other experiment which I suggested to you?\r\n\r\nY.M. Which one?\r\n\r\nO.M. The one which was to determine how much influence you have over\r\nyour mind--if any.\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes, and got more or less entertainment out of it. I did as you\r\nordered: I placed two texts before my eyes--one a dull one and barren\r\nof interest, the other one full of interest, inflamed with it, white-hot\r\nwith it. I commanded my mind to busy itself solely with the dull one.\r\n\r\nO.M. Did it obey?\r\n\r\nY.M. Well, no, it didn't. It busied itself with the other one.\r\n\r\nO.M. Did you try hard to make it obey?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes, I did my honest best.\r\n\r\nO.M. What was the text which it refused to be interested in or think\r\nabout?\r\n\r\nY.M. It was this question: If A owes B a dollar and a half, and B owes\r\nC two and three-quarter, and C owes A thirty--five cents, and D and A\r\ntogether owe E and B three-sixteenths of--of--I don't remember the\r\nrest, now, but anyway it was wholly uninteresting, and I could not force\r\nmy mind to stick to it even half a minute at a time; it kept flying off\r\nto the other text.\r\n\r\nO.M. What was the other text?\r\n\r\nY.M. It is no matter about that.\r\n\r\nO.M. But what was it?\r\n\r\nY.M. A photograph.\r\n\r\nO.M. Your own?\r\n\r\nY.M. No. It was hers.\r\n\r\nO.M. You really made an honest good test. Did you make a second trial?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes. I commanded my mind to interest itself in the morning paper's\r\nreport of the pork-market, and at the same time I reminded it of an\r\nexperience of mine of sixteen years ago. It refused to consider the pork\r\nand gave its whole blazing interest to that ancient incident.\r\n\r\nO.M. What was the incident?\r\n\r\nY.M. An armed desperado slapped my face in the presence of twenty\r\nspectators. It makes me wild and murderous every time I think of it.\r\n\r\nO.M. Good tests, both; very good tests. Did you try my other suggestion?\r\n\r\nY.M. The one which was to prove to me that if I would leave my mind to\r\nits own devices it would find things to think about without any of my\r\nhelp, and thus convince me that it was a machine, an automatic machine,\r\nset in motion by exterior influences, and as independent of me as it\r\ncould be if it were in some one else's skull. Is that the one?\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes.\r\n\r\nY.M. I tried it. I was shaving. I had slept well, and my mind was very\r\nlively, even gay and frisky. It was reveling in a fantastic and joyful\r\nepisode of my remote boyhood which had suddenly flashed up in my\r\nmemory--moved to this by the spectacle of a yellow cat picking its\r\nway carefully along the top of the garden wall. The color of this\r\ncat brought the bygone cat before me, and I saw her walking along the\r\nside-step of the pulpit; saw her walk on to a large sheet of sticky\r\nfly-paper and get all her feet involved; saw her struggle and fall\r\ndown, helpless and dissatisfied, more and more urgent, more and more\r\nunreconciled, more and more mutely profane; saw the silent congregation\r\nquivering like jelly, and the tears running down their faces. I saw\r\nit all. The sight of the tears whisked my mind to a far distant and a\r\nsadder scene--in Terra del Fuego--and with Darwin's eyes I saw a naked\r\ngreat savage hurl his little boy against the rocks for a trifling fault;\r\nsaw the poor mother gather up her dying child and hug it to her breast\r\nand weep, uttering no word. Did my mind stop to mourn with that nude\r\nblack sister of mine? No--it was far away from that scene in an instant,\r\nand was busying itself with an ever-recurring and disagreeable dream of\r\nmine. In this dream I always find myself, stripped to my shirt, cringing\r\nand dodging about in the midst of a great drawing-room throng of finely\r\ndressed ladies and gentlemen, and wondering how I got there. And so on\r\nand so on, picture after picture, incident after incident, a drifting\r\npanorama of ever-changing, ever-dissolving views manufactured by my mind\r\nwithout any help from me--why, it would take me two hours to merely name\r\nthe multitude of things my mind tallied off and photographed in fifteen\r\nminutes, let alone describe them to you.\r\n\r\nO.M. A man's mind, left free, has no use for his help. But there is one\r\nway whereby he can get its help when he desires it.\r\n\r\nY.M. What is that way?\r\n\r\nO.M. When your mind is racing along from subject to subject and\r\nstrikes an inspiring one, open your mouth and begin talking upon that\r\nmatter--or--take your pen and use that. It will interest your mind and\r\nconcentrate it, and it will pursue the subject with satisfaction. It\r\nwill take full charge, and furnish the words itself.\r\n\r\nY.M. But don't I tell it what to say?\r\n\r\nO.M. There are certainly occasions when you haven't time. The words leap\r\nout before you know what is coming.\r\n\r\nY.M. For instance?\r\n\r\nO.M. Well, take a \"flash of wit\"--repartee. Flash is the right word.\r\nIt is out instantly. There is no time to arrange the words. There is no\r\nthinking, no reflecting. Where there is a wit-mechanism it is automatic\r\nin its action and needs no help. Where the wit-mechanism is lacking, no\r\namount of study and reflection can manufacture the product.\r\n\r\nY.M. You really think a man originates nothing, creates nothing.\r\n\r\n_The Thinking-Process_\r\n\r\nO.M. I do. Men perceive, and their brain-machines automatically combine\r\nthe things perceived. That is all.\r\n\r\nY.M. The steam-engine?\r\n\r\nO.M. It takes fifty men a hundred years to invent it. One meaning of\r\ninvent is discover. I use the word in that sense. Little by little they\r\ndiscover and apply the multitude of details that go to make the perfect\r\nengine. Watt noticed that confined steam was strong enough to lift the\r\nlid of the teapot. He didn't create the idea, he merely discovered the\r\nfact; the cat had noticed it a hundred times. From the teapot he evolved\r\nthe cylinder--from the displaced lid he evolved the piston-rod. To\r\nattach something to the piston-rod to be moved by it, was a simple\r\nmatter--crank and wheel. And so there was a working engine.\r\n\r\nOne by one, improvements were discovered by men who used their eyes,\r\nnot their creating powers--for they hadn't any--and now, after a hundred\r\nyears the patient contributions of fifty or a hundred observers stand\r\ncompacted in the wonderful machine which drives the ocean liner.\r\n\r\nY.M. A Shakespearean play?\r\n\r\nO.M. The process is the same. The first actor was a savage. He\r\nreproduced in his theatrical war-dances, scalp--dances, and so on,\r\nincidents which he had seen in real life. A more advanced civilization\r\nproduced more incidents, more episodes; the actor and the story-teller\r\nborrowed them. And so the drama grew, little by little, stage by stage.\r\nIt is made up of the facts of life, not creations. It took centuries to\r\ndevelop the Greek drama. It borrowed from preceding ages; it lent to the\r\nages that came after. Men observe and combine, that is all. So does a\r\nrat.\r\n\r\nY.M. How?\r\n\r\nO.M. He observes a smell, he infers a cheese, he seeks and finds.\r\nThe astronomer observes this and that; adds his this and that to the\r\nthis-and-thats of a hundred predecessors, infers an invisible planet,\r\nseeks it and finds it. The rat gets into a trap; gets out with trouble;\r\ninfers that cheese in traps lacks value, and meddles with that trap no\r\nmore. The astronomer is very proud of his achievement, the rat is proud\r\nof his. Yet both are machines; they have done machine work, they have\r\noriginated nothing, they have no right to be vain; the whole credit\r\nbelongs to their Maker. They are entitled to no honors, no praises, no\r\nmonuments when they die, no remembrance. One is a complex and elaborate\r\nmachine, the other a simple and limited machine, but they are alike in\r\nprinciple, function, and process, and neither of them works otherwise\r\nthan automatically, and neither of them may righteously claim a\r\n_personal _superiority or a personal dignity above the other.\r\n\r\nY.M. In earned personal dignity, then, and in personal merit for what he\r\ndoes, it follows of necessity that he is on the same level as a rat?\r\n\r\nO.M. His brother the rat; yes, that is how it seems to me. Neither of\r\nthem being entitled to any personal merit for what he does, it follows\r\nof necessity that neither of them has a right to arrogate to himself\r\n(personally created) superiorities over his brother.\r\n\r\nY.M. Are you determined to go on believing in these insanities? Would\r\nyou go on believing in them in the face of able arguments backed by\r\ncollated facts and instances?\r\n\r\nO.M. I have been a humble, earnest, and sincere Truth-Seeker.\r\n\r\nY.M. Very well?\r\n\r\nO.M. The humble, earnest, and sincere Truth-Seeker is always convertible\r\nby such means.\r\n\r\nY.M. I am thankful to God to hear you say this, for now I know that your\r\nconversion--\r\n\r\nO.M. Wait. You misunderstand. I said I have _been _a Truth-Seeker.\r\n\r\nY.M. Well?\r\n\r\nO.M. I am not that now. Have your forgotten? I told you that there\r\nare none but temporary Truth-Seekers; that a permanent one is a human\r\nimpossibility; that as soon as the Seeker finds what he is thoroughly\r\nconvinced is the Truth, he seeks no further, but gives the rest of his\r\ndays to hunting junk to patch it and caulk it and prop it with, and\r\nmake it weather-proof and keep it from caving in on him. Hence the\r\nPresbyterian remains a Presbyterian, the Mohammedan a Mohammedan, the\r\nSpiritualist a Spiritualist, the Democrat a Democrat, the Republican a\r\nRepublican, the Monarchist a Monarchist; and if a humble, earnest, and\r\nsincere Seeker after Truth should find it in the proposition that the\r\nmoon is made of green cheese nothing could ever budge him from that\r\nposition; for he is nothing but an automatic machine, and must obey the\r\nlaws of his construction.\r\n\r\nY.M. And so--\r\n\r\nO.M. Having found the Truth; perceiving that beyond question man has but\r\none moving impulse--the contenting of his own spirit--and is merely a\r\nmachine and entitled to no personal merit for anything he does, it is\r\nnot humanly possible for me to seek further. The rest of my days will\r\nbe spent in patching and painting and puttying and caulking my priceless\r\npossession and in looking the other way when an imploring argument or a\r\ndamaging fact approaches.\r\n\r\n1. The Marquess of Worcester had done all of this more than a century\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nInstinct and Thought\r\n\r\nYoung Man. It is odious. Those drunken theories of yours, advanced a\r\nwhile ago--concerning the rat and all that--strip Man bare of all his\r\ndignities, grandeurs, sublimities.\r\n\r\nOld Man. He hasn't any to strip--they are shams, stolen clothes. He\r\nclaims credits which belong solely to his Maker.\r\n\r\nY.M. But you have no right to put him on a level with a rat.\r\n\r\nO.M. I don't--morally. That would not be fair to the rat. The rat is\r\nwell above him, there.\r\n\r\nY.M. Are you joking?\r\n\r\nO.M. No, I am not.\r\n\r\nY.M. Then what do you mean?\r\n\r\nO.M. That comes under the head of the Moral Sense. It is a large\r\nquestion. Let us finish with what we are about now, before we take it\r\nup.\r\n\r\nY.M. Very well. You have seemed to concede that you place Man and the\r\nrat on a level. What is it? The intellectual?\r\n\r\nO.M. In form--not a degree.\r\n\r\nY.M. Explain.\r\n\r\nO.M. I think that the rat's mind and the man's mind are the same\r\nmachine, but of unequal capacities--like yours and Edison's; like the\r\nAfrican pygmy's and Homer's; like the Bushman's and Bismarck's.\r\n\r\nY.M. How are you going to make that out, when the lower animals have no\r\nmental quality but instinct, while man possesses reason?\r\n\r\nO.M. What is instinct?\r\n\r\nY.M. It is merely unthinking and mechanical exercise of inherited habit.\r\n\r\nO.M. What originated the habit?\r\n\r\nY.M. The first animal started it, its descendants have inherited it.\r\n\r\nO.M. How did the first one come to start it?\r\n\r\nY.M. I don't know; but it didn't _think _it out.\r\n\r\nO.M. How do you know it didn't?\r\n\r\nY.M. Well--I have a right to suppose it didn't, anyway.\r\n\r\nO.M. I don't believe you have. What is thought?\r\n\r\nY.M. I know what you call it: the mechanical and automatic putting\r\ntogether of impressions received from outside, and drawing an inference\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nO.M. Very good. Now my idea of the meaningless term \"instinct\" is,\r\nthat it is merely _petrified thought; _solidified and made inanimate\r\nby habit; thought which was once alive and awake, but is become\r\nunconscious--walks in its sleep, so to speak.\r\n\r\nY.M. Illustrate it.\r\n\r\nO.M. Take a herd of cows, feeding in a pasture. Their heads are all\r\nturned in one direction. They do that instinctively; they gain nothing\r\nby it, they have no reason for it, they don't know why they do it. It\r\nis an inherited habit which was originally thought--that is to say,\r\nobservation of an exterior fact, and a valuable inference drawn from\r\nthat observation and confirmed by experience. The original wild ox\r\nnoticed that with the wind in his favor he could smell his enemy in time\r\nto escape; then he inferred that it was worth while to keep his nose\r\nto the wind. That is the process which man calls reasoning. Man's\r\nthought-machine works just like the other animals', but it is a better\r\none and more Edisonian. Man, in the ox's place, would go further, reason\r\nwider: he would face part of the herd the other way and protect both\r\nfront and rear.\r\n\r\nY.M. Did you stay the term instinct is meaningless?\r\n\r\nO.M. I think it is a bastard word. I think it confuses us; for as a rule\r\nit applies itself to habits and impulses which had a far-off origin in\r\nthought, and now and then breaks the rule and applies itself to habits\r\nwhich can hardly claim a thought-origin.\r\n\r\nY.M. Give an instance.\r\n\r\nO.M. Well, in putting on trousers a man always inserts the same old leg\r\nfirst--never the other one. There is no advantage in that, and no sense\r\nin it. All men do it, yet no man thought it out and adopted it of set\r\npurpose, I imagine. But it is a habit which is transmitted, no doubt,\r\nand will continue to be transmitted.\r\n\r\nY.M. Can you prove that the habit exists?\r\n\r\nO.M. You can prove it, if you doubt. If you will take a man to a\r\nclothing-store and watch him try on a dozen pairs of trousers, you will\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nY.M. The cow illustration is not--\r\n\r\nO.M. Sufficient to show that a dumb animal's mental machine is just the\r\nsame as a man's and its reasoning processes the same? I will illustrate\r\nfurther. If you should hand Mr. Edison a box which you caused to fly\r\nopen by some concealed device he would infer a spring, and would hunt\r\nfor it and find it. Now an uncle of mine had an old horse who used to\r\nget into the closed lot where the corn-crib was and dishonestly take\r\nthe corn. I got the punishment myself, as it was supposed that I had\r\nheedlessly failed to insert the wooden pin which kept the gate closed.\r\nThese persistent punishments fatigued me; they also caused me to infer\r\nthe existence of a culprit, somewhere; so I hid myself and watched the\r\ngate. Presently the horse came and pulled the pin out with his teeth and\r\nwent in. Nobody taught him that; he had observed--then thought it out\r\nfor himself. His process did not differ from Edison's; he put this and\r\nthat together and drew an inference--and the peg, too; but I made him\r\nsweat for it.\r\n\r\nY.M. It has something of the seeming of thought about it. Still it is\r\nnot very elaborate. Enlarge.\r\n\r\nO.M. Suppose Mr. Edison has been enjoying some one's hospitalities. He\r\ncomes again by and by, and the house is vacant. He infers that his host\r\nhas moved. A while afterward, in another town, he sees the man enter\r\na house; he infers that that is the new home, and follows to inquire.\r\nHere, now, is the experience of a gull, as related by a naturalist. The\r\nscene is a Scotch fishing village where the gulls were kindly treated.\r\nThis particular gull visited a cottage; was fed; came next day and was\r\nfed again; came into the house, next time, and ate with the family; kept\r\non doing this almost daily, thereafter. But, once the gull was away on\r\na journey for a few days, and when it returned the house was vacant.\r\nIts friends had removed to a village three miles distant. Several months\r\nlater it saw the head of the family on the street there, followed him\r\nhome, entered the house without excuse or apology, and became a daily\r\nguest again. Gulls do not rank high mentally, but this one had memory\r\nand the reasoning faculty, you see, and applied them Edisonially.\r\n\r\nY.M. Yet it was not an Edison and couldn't be developed into one.\r\n\r\nO.M. Perhaps not. Could you?\r\n\r\nY.M. That is neither here nor there. Go on.\r\n\r\nO.M. If Edison were in trouble and a stranger helped him out of it and\r\nnext day he got into the same difficulty again, he would infer the wise\r\nthing to do in case he knew the stranger's address. Here is a case of a\r\nbird and a stranger as related by a naturalist. An Englishman saw a bird\r\nflying around about his dog's head, down in the grounds, and uttering\r\ncries of distress. He went there to see about it. The dog had a young\r\nbird in his mouth--unhurt. The gentleman rescued it and put it on a bush\r\nand brought the dog away. Early the next morning the mother bird came\r\nfor the gentleman, who was sitting on his veranda, and by its maneuvers\r\npersuaded him to follow it to a distant part of the grounds--flying a\r\nlittle way in front of him and waiting for him to catch up, and so on;\r\nand keeping to the winding path, too, instead of flying the near way\r\nacross lots. The distance covered was four hundred yards. The same dog\r\nwas the culprit; he had the young bird again, and once more he had\r\nto give it up. Now the mother bird had reasoned it all out: since the\r\nstranger had helped her once, she inferred that he would do it\r\nagain; she knew where to find him, and she went upon her errand with\r\nconfidence. Her mental processes were what Edison's would have been. She\r\nput this and that together--and that is all that thought _is _--and out\r\nof them built her logical arrangement of inferences. Edison couldn't\r\nhave done it any better himself.\r\n\r\nY.M. Do you believe that many of the dumb animals can think?\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes--the elephant, the monkey, the horse, the dog, the parrot, the\r\nmacaw, the mocking-bird, and many others. The elephant whose mate fell\r\ninto a pit, and who dumped dirt and rubbish into the pit till bottom was\r\nraised high enough to enable the captive to step out, was equipped with\r\nthe reasoning quality. I conceive that all animals that can learn things\r\nthrough teaching and drilling have to know how to observe, and put this\r\nand that together and draw an inference--the process of thinking. Could\r\nyou teach an idiot the manual of arms, and to advance, retreat, and go\r\nthrough complex field maneuvers at the word of command?\r\n\r\nY.M. Not if he were a thorough idiot.\r\n\r\nO.M. Well, canary-birds can learn all that; dogs and elephants learn all\r\nsorts of wonderful things. They must surely be able to notice, and to\r\nput things together, and say to themselves, \"I get the idea, now: when I\r\ndo so and so, as per order, I am praised and fed; when I do differently\r\nI am punished.\" Fleas can be taught nearly anything that a Congressman\r\ncan.\r\n\r\nY.M. Granting, then, that dumb animals are able to think upon a low\r\nplane, is there any that can think upon a high one? Is there one that is\r\nwell up toward man?\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes. As a thinker and planner the ant is the equal of any savage\r\nrace of men; as a self-educated specialist in several arts she is\r\nthe superior of any savage race of men; and in one or two high mental\r\nqualities she is above the reach of any man, savage or civilized!\r\n\r\nY.M. Oh, come! you are abolishing the intellectual frontier which\r\nseparates man and beast.\r\n\r\nO.M. I beg your pardon. One cannot abolish what does not exist.\r\n\r\nY.M. You are not in earnest, I hope. You cannot mean to seriously say\r\nthere is no such frontier.\r\n\r\nO.M. I do say it seriously. The instances of the horse, the gull, the\r\nmother bird, and the elephant show that those creatures put their this's\r\nand thats together just as Edison would have done it and drew the same\r\ninferences that he would have drawn. Their mental machinery was just\r\nlike his, also its manner of working. Their equipment was as inferior\r\nto the Strasburg clock, but that is the only difference--there is no\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\nY.M. It looks exasperatingly true; and is distinctly offensive. It\r\nelevates the dumb beasts to--to--\r\n\r\nO.M. Let us drop that lying phrase, and call them the Unrevealed\r\nCreatures; so far as we can know, there is no such thing as a dumb\r\nbeast.\r\n\r\nY.M. On what grounds do you make that assertion?\r\n\r\nO.M. On quite simple ones. \"Dumb\" beast suggests an animal that has no\r\nthought-machinery, no understanding, no speech, no way of communicating\r\nwhat is in its mind. We know that a hen _has _speech. We cannot\r\nunderstand everything she says, but we easily learn two or three of her\r\nphrases. We know when she is saying, \"I have laid an egg\"; we know when\r\nshe is saying to the chicks, \"Run here, dears, I've found a worm\"; we\r\nknow what she is saying when she voices a warning: \"Quick! hurry! gather\r\nyourselves under mamma, there's a hawk coming!\" We understand the cat\r\nwhen she stretches herself out, purring with affection and contentment\r\nand lifts up a soft voice and says, \"Come, kitties, supper's ready\"; we\r\nunderstand her when she goes mourning about and says, \"Where can they\r\nbe? They are lost. Won't you help me hunt for them?\" and we understand\r\nthe disreputable Tom when he challenges at midnight from his shed, \"You\r\ncome over here, you product of immoral commerce, and I'll make your fur\r\nfly!\" We understand a few of a dog's phrases and we learn to understand\r\na few of the remarks and gestures of any bird or other animal that we\r\ndomesticate and observe. The clearness and exactness of the few of the\r\nhen's speeches which we understand is argument that she can communicate\r\nto her kind a hundred things which we cannot comprehend--in a word, that\r\nshe can converse. And this argument is also applicable in the case of\r\nothers of the great army of the Unrevealed. It is just like man's vanity\r\nand impertinence to call an animal dumb because it is dumb to his dull\r\nperceptions. Now as to the ant--\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes, go back to the ant, the creature that--as you seem to\r\nthink--sweeps away the last vestige of an intellectual frontier between\r\nman and the Unrevealed.\r\n\r\nO.M. That is what she surely does. In all his history the aboriginal\r\nAustralian never thought out a house for himself and built it. The ant\r\nis an amazing architect. She is a wee little creature, but she builds a\r\nstrong and enduring house eight feet high--a house which is as large\r\nin proportion to her size as is the largest capitol or cathedral in the\r\nworld compared to man's size. No savage race has produced architects\r\nwho could approach the ant in genius or culture. No civilized race has\r\nproduced architects who could plan a house better for the uses proposed\r\nthan can hers. Her house contains a throne-room; nurseries for her\r\nyoung; granaries; apartments for her soldiers, her workers, etc.; and\r\nthey and the multifarious halls and corridors which communicate with\r\nthem are arranged and distributed with an educated and experienced eye\r\nfor convenience and adaptability.\r\n\r\nY.M. That could be mere instinct.\r\n\r\nO.M. It would elevate the savage if he had it. But let us look further\r\nbefore we decide. The ant has soldiers--battalions, regiments, armies;\r\nand they have their appointed captains and generals, who lead them to\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nY.M. That could be instinct, too.\r\n\r\nO.M. We will look still further. The ant has a system of government; it\r\nis well planned, elaborate, and is well carried on.\r\n\r\nY.M. Instinct again.\r\n\r\nO.M. She has crowds of slaves, and is a hard and unjust employer of\r\nforced labor.\r\n\r\nY.M. Instinct.\r\n\r\nO.M. She has cows, and milks them.\r\n\r\nY.M. Instinct, of course.\r\n\r\nO.M. In Texas she lays out a farm twelve feet square, plants it, weeds\r\nit, cultivates it, gathers the crop and stores it away.\r\n\r\nY.M. Instinct, all the same.\r\n\r\nO.M. The ant discriminates between friend and stranger. Sir John Lubbock\r\ntook ants from two different nests, made them drunk with whiskey and\r\nlaid them, unconscious, by one of the nests, near some water. Ants from\r\nthe nest came and examined and discussed these disgraced creatures, then\r\ncarried their friends home and threw the strangers overboard. Sir John\r\nrepeated the experiment a number of times. For a time the sober ants\r\ndid as they had done at first--carried their friends home and threw the\r\nstrangers overboard. But finally they lost patience, seeing that\r\ntheir reformatory efforts went for nothing, and threw both friends and\r\nstrangers overboard. Come--is this instinct, or is it thoughtful\r\nand intelligent discussion of a thing new--absolutely new--to their\r\nexperience; with a verdict arrived at, sentence passed, and judgment\r\nexecuted? Is it instinct?--thought petrified by ages of habit--or\r\nisn't it brand-new thought, inspired by the new occasion, the new\r\ncircumstances?\r\n\r\nY.M. I have to concede it. It was not a result of habit; it has all\r\nthe look of reflection, thought, putting this and that together, as you\r\nphrase it. I believe it was thought.\r\n\r\nO.M. I will give you another instance of thought. Franklin had a cup\r\nof sugar on a table in his room. The ants got at it. He tried several\r\npreventives; and ants rose superior to them. Finally he contrived one\r\nwhich shut off access--probably set the table's legs in pans of water,\r\nor drew a circle of tar around the cup, I don't remember. At any\r\nrate, he watched to see what they would do. They tried various\r\nschemes--failures, every one. The ants were badly puzzled. Finally they\r\nheld a consultation, discussed the problem, arrived at a decision--and\r\nthis time they beat that great philosopher. They formed in procession,\r\ncross the floor, climbed the wall, marched across the ceiling to a point\r\njust over the cup, then one by one they let go and fell down into it!\r\nWas that instinct--thought petrified by ages of inherited habit?\r\n\r\nY.M. No, I don't believe it was. I believe it was a newly reasoned\r\nscheme to meet a new emergency.\r\n\r\nO.M. Very well. You have conceded the reasoning power in two instances.\r\nI come now to a mental detail wherein the ant is a long way the superior\r\nof any human being. Sir John Lubbock proved by many experiments that an\r\nant knows a stranger ant of her own species in a moment, even when the\r\nstranger is disguised--with paint. Also he proved that an ant knows\r\nevery individual in her hive of five hundred thousand souls. Also, after\r\na year's absence one of the five hundred thousand she will straightway\r\nrecognize the returned absentee and grace the recognition with an\r\naffectionate welcome. How are these recognitions made? Not by color,\r\nfor painted ants were recognized. Not by smell, for ants that had been\r\ndipped in chloroform were recognized. Not by speech and not by antennae\r\nsigns nor contacts, for the drunken and motionless ants were recognized\r\nand the friend discriminated from the stranger. The ants were all of\r\nthe same species, therefore the friends had to be recognized by form and\r\nfeature--friends who formed part of a hive of five hundred thousand!\r\nHas any man a memory for form and feature approaching that?\r\n\r\nY.M. Certainly not.\r\n\r\nO.M. Franklin's ants and Lubbuck's ants show fine capacities of putting\r\nthis and that together in new and untried emergencies and deducting\r\nsmart conclusions from the combinations--a man's mental process\r\nexactly. With memory to help, man preserves his observations and\r\nreasonings, reflects upon them, adds to them, recombines, and so\r\nproceeds, stage by stage, to far results--from the teakettle to the\r\nocean greyhound's complex engine; from personal labor to slave labor;\r\nfrom wigwam to palace; from the capricious chase to agriculture and\r\nstored food; from nomadic life to stable government and concentrated\r\nauthority; from incoherent hordes to massed armies. The ant has\r\nobservation, the reasoning faculty, and the preserving adjunct of\r\na prodigious memory; she has duplicated man's development and the\r\nessential features of his civilization, and you call it all instinct!\r\n\r\nY.M. Perhaps I lacked the reasoning faculty myself.\r\n\r\nO.M. Well, don't tell anybody, and don't do it again.\r\n\r\nY.M. We have come a good way. As a result--as I understand it--I am\r\nrequired to concede that there is absolutely no intellectual frontier\r\nseparating Man and the Unrevealed Creatures?\r\n\r\nO.M. That is what you are required to concede. There is no such\r\nfrontier--there is no way to get around that. Man has a finer and more\r\ncapable machine in him than those others, but it is the same machine and\r\nworks in the same way. And neither he nor those others can command the\r\nmachine--it is strictly automatic, independent of control, works when it\r\npleases, and when it doesn't please, it can't be forced.\r\n\r\nY.M. Then man and the other animals are all alike, as to mental\r\nmachinery, and there isn't any difference of any stupendous magnitude\r\nbetween them, except in quality, not in kind.\r\n\r\nO.M. That is about the state of it--intellectuality. There are\r\npronounced limitations on both sides. We can't learn to understand much\r\nof their language, but the dog, the elephant, etc., learn to understand\r\na very great deal of ours. To that extent they are our superiors. On the\r\nother hand, they can't learn reading, writing, etc., nor any of our fine\r\nand high things, and there we have a large advantage over them.\r\n\r\nY.M. Very well, let them have what they've got, and welcome; there is\r\nstill a wall, and a lofty one. They haven't got the Moral Sense; we have\r\nit, and it lifts us immeasurably above them.\r\n\r\nO.M. What makes you think that?\r\n\r\nY.M. Now look here--let's call a halt. I have stood the other infamies\r\nand insanities and that is enough; I am not going to have man and the\r\nother animals put on the same level morally.\r\n\r\nO.M. I wasn't going to hoist man up to that.\r\n\r\nY.M. This is too much! I think it is not right to jest about such\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nO.M. I am not jesting, I am merely reflecting a plain and simple\r\ntruth--and without uncharitableness. The fact that man knows right from\r\nwrong proves his _intellectual _superiority to the other creatures; but\r\nthe fact that he can _do _wrong proves his _moral _inferiority to\r\nany creature that _cannot_. It is my belief that this position is not\r\nassailable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Free Will_\r\n\r\nY.M. What is your opinion regarding Free Will?\r\n\r\nO.M. That there is no such thing. Did the man possess it who gave the\r\nold woman his last shilling and trudged home in the storm?\r\n\r\nY.M. He had the choice between succoring the old woman and leaving her\r\nto suffer. Isn't it so?\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes, there was a choice to be made, between bodily comfort on the\r\none hand and the comfort of the spirit on the other. The body made a\r\nstrong appeal, of course--the body would be quite sure to do that; the\r\nspirit made a counter appeal. A choice had to be made between the two\r\nappeals, and was made. Who or what determined that choice?\r\n\r\nY.M. Any one but you would say that the man determined it, and that in\r\ndoing it he exercised Free Will.\r\n\r\nO.M. We are constantly assured that every man is endowed with Free\r\nWill, and that he can and must exercise it where he is offered a choice\r\nbetween good conduct and less-good conduct. Yet we clearly saw that\r\nin that man's case he really had no Free Will: his temperament, his\r\ntraining, and the daily influences which had molded him and made him\r\nwhat he was, _compelled _him to rescue the old woman and thus save\r\n_himself _--save himself from spiritual pain, from unendurable\r\nwretchedness. He did not make the choice, it was made _for _him by\r\nforces which he could not control. Free Will has always existed in\r\n_words_, but it stops there, I think--stops short of _fact_. I would not\r\nuse those words--Free Will--but others.\r\n\r\nY.M. What others?\r\n\r\nO.M. Free Choice.\r\n\r\nY.M. What is the difference?\r\n\r\nO.M. The one implies untrammeled power to _act _as you please, the other\r\nimplies nothing beyond a mere _mental process: _the critical ability to\r\ndetermine which of two things is nearest right and just.\r\n\r\nY.M. Make the difference clear, please.\r\n\r\nO.M. The mind can freely _select, choose, point out _the right and just\r\none--its function stops there. It can go no further in the matter. It\r\nhas no authority to say that the right one shall be acted upon and the\r\nwrong one discarded. That authority is in other hands.\r\n\r\nY.M. The man's?\r\n\r\nO.M. In the machine which stands for him. In his born disposition\r\nand the character which has been built around it by training and\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nY.M. It will act upon the right one of the two?\r\n\r\nO.M. It will do as it pleases in the matter. George Washington's machine\r\nwould act upon the right one; Pizarro would act upon the wrong one.\r\n\r\nY.M. Then as I understand it a bad man's mental machinery calmly and\r\njudicially points out which of two things is right and just--\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes, and his _moral _machinery will freely act upon the one\r\nor the other, according to its make, and be quite indifferent to the\r\n_mind's _feeling concerning the matter--that is, _would _be, if the\r\nmind had any feelings; which it hasn't. It is merely a thermometer: it\r\nregisters the heat and the cold, and cares not a farthing about either.\r\n\r\nY.M. Then we must not claim that if a man _knows _which of two things is\r\nright he is absolutely _bound _to do that thing?\r\n\r\nO.M. His temperament and training will decide what he shall do, and he\r\nwill do it; he cannot help himself, he has no authority over the matter.\r\nWasn't it right for David to go out and slay Goliath?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes.\r\n\r\nO.M. Then it would have been equally _right _for any one else to do it?\r\n\r\nY.M. Certainly.\r\n\r\nO.M. Then it would have been _right _for a born coward to attempt it?\r\n\r\nY.M. It would--yes.\r\n\r\nO.M. You know that no born coward ever would have attempted it, don't\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes.\r\n\r\nO.M. You know that a born coward's make and temperament would be an\r\nabsolute and insurmountable bar to his ever essaying such a thing, don't\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes, I know it.\r\n\r\nO.M. He clearly perceives that it would be _right _to try it?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes.\r\n\r\nO.M. His mind has Free Choice in determining that it would be _right _to\r\ntry it?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes.\r\n\r\nO.M. Then if by reason of his inborn cowardice he simply can _not _essay\r\nit, what becomes of his Free Will? Where is his Free Will? Why claim\r\nthat he has Free Will when the plain facts show that he hasn't? Why\r\ncontend that because he and David _see _the right alike, both must _act\r\n_alike? Why impose the same laws upon goat and lion?\r\n\r\nY.M. There is really no such thing as Free Will?\r\n\r\nO.M. It is what I think. There is _will_. But it has nothing to do with\r\n_intellectual perceptions of right and wrong, _and is not under their\r\ncommand. David's temperament and training had Will, and it was a\r\ncompulsory force; David had to obey its decrees, he had no choice. The\r\ncoward's temperament and training possess Will, and _it _is compulsory;\r\nit commands him to avoid danger, and he obeys, he has no choice. But\r\nneither the Davids nor the cowards possess Free Will--will that may do\r\nthe right or do the wrong, as their _mental _verdict shall decide.\r\n\r\n_Not Two Values, But Only One_\r\n\r\nY.M. There is one thing which bothers me: I can't tell where you draw\r\nthe line between _material _covetousness and _spiritual _covetousness.\r\n\r\nO.M. I don't draw any.\r\n\r\nY.M. How do you mean?\r\n\r\nO.M. There is no such thing as _material _covetousness. All covetousness\r\nis spiritual.\r\n\r\nY.M. _All _longings, desires, ambitions _spiritual, _never material?\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes. The Master in you requires that in _all _cases you shall\r\ncontent his _spirit _--that alone. He never requires anything else, he\r\nnever interests himself in any other matter.\r\n\r\nY.M. Ah, come! When he covets somebody's money--isn't that rather\r\ndistinctly material and gross?\r\n\r\nO.M. No. The money is merely a symbol--it represents in visible and\r\nconcrete form a _spiritual desire. _Any so-called material thing that\r\nyou want is merely a symbol: you want it not for _itself_, but because\r\nit will content your spirit for the moment.\r\n\r\nY.M. Please particularize.\r\n\r\nO.M. Very well. Maybe the thing longed for is a new hat. You get it\r\nand your vanity is pleased, your spirit contented. Suppose your friends\r\nderide the hat, make fun of it: at once it loses its value; you are\r\nashamed of it, you put it out of your sight, you never want to see it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nY.M. I think I see. Go on.\r\n\r\nO.M. It is the same hat, isn't it? It is in no way altered. But it\r\nwasn't the _hat _you wanted, but only what it stood for--a something to\r\nplease and content your _spirit_. When it failed of that, the whole\r\nof its value was gone. There are no _material _values; there are only\r\nspiritual ones. You will hunt in vain for a material value that is\r\n_actual, real--_there is no such thing. The only value it possesses, for\r\neven a moment, is the spiritual value back of it: remove that end and it\r\nis at once worthless--like the hat.\r\n\r\nY.M. Can you extend that to money?\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes. It is merely a symbol, it has no _material _value; you think\r\nyou desire it for its own sake, but it is not so. You desire it for the\r\nspiritual content it will bring; if it fail of that, you discover that\r\nits value is gone. There is that pathetic tale of the man who labored\r\nlike a slave, unresting, unsatisfied, until he had accumulated a\r\nfortune, and was happy over it, jubilant about it; then in a single week\r\na pestilence swept away all whom he held dear and left him desolate. His\r\nmoney's value was gone. He realized that his joy in it came not from\r\nthe money itself, but from the spiritual contentment he got out of his\r\nfamily's enjoyment of the pleasures and delights it lavished upon them.\r\nMoney has no _material _value; if you remove its spiritual value nothing\r\nis left but dross. It is so with all things, little or big, majestic\r\nor trivial--there are no exceptions. Crowns, scepters, pennies, paste\r\njewels, village notoriety, world-wide fame--they are all the same,\r\nthey have no _material _value: while they content the _spirit _they are\r\nprecious, when this fails they are worthless.\r\n\r\n_A Difficult Question_\r\n\r\nY.M. You keep me confused and perplexed all the time by your elusive\r\nterminology. Sometimes you divide a man up into two or three\r\nseparate personalities, each with authorities, jurisdictions, and\r\nresponsibilities of its own, and when he is in that condition I can't\r\ngrasp it. Now when _I_ speak of a man, he is _the whole thing in one,\r\n_and easy to hold and contemplate.\r\n\r\nO.M. That is pleasant and convenient, if true. When you speak of \"my\r\nbody\" who is the \"my\"?\r\n\r\nY.M. It is the \"me.\"\r\n\r\nO.M. The body is a property then, and the Me owns it. Who is the Me?\r\n\r\nY.M. The Me is _the whole thing; _it is a common property; an undivided\r\nownership, vested in the whole entity.\r\n\r\nO.M. If the Me admires a rainbow, is it the whole Me that admires it,\r\nincluding the hair, hands, heels, and all?\r\n\r\nY.M. Certainly not. It is my _mind _that admires it.\r\n\r\nO.M. So _you _divide the Me yourself. Everybody does; everybody must.\r\nWhat, then, definitely, is the Me?\r\n\r\nY.M. I think it must consist of just those two parts--the body and the\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nO.M. You think so? If you say \"I believe the world is round,\" who is the\r\n\"I\" that is speaking?\r\n\r\nY.M. The mind.\r\n\r\nO.M. If you say \"I grieve for the loss of my father,\" who is the \"I\"?\r\n\r\nY.M. The mind.\r\n\r\nO.M. Is the mind exercising an intellectual function when it examines\r\nand accepts the evidence that the world is round?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes.\r\n\r\nO.M. Is it exercising an intellectual function when it grieves for the\r\nloss of your father?\r\n\r\nY.M. That is not cerebration, brain-work, it is a matter of _feeling_.\r\n\r\nO.M. Then its source is not in your mind, but in your _moral _territory?\r\n\r\nY.M. I have to grant it.\r\n\r\nO.M. Is your mind a part of your _physical _equipment?\r\n\r\nY.M. No. It is independent of it; it is spiritual.\r\n\r\nO.M. Being spiritual, it cannot be affected by physical influences?\r\n\r\nY.M. No.\r\n\r\nO.M. Does the mind remain sober with the body is drunk?\r\n\r\nY.M. Well--no.\r\n\r\nO.M. There _is _a physical effect present, then?\r\n\r\nY.M. It looks like it.\r\n\r\nO.M. A cracked skull has resulted in a crazy mind. Why should it happen\r\nif the mind is spiritual, and _independent _of physical influences?\r\n\r\nY.M. Well--I don't know.\r\n\r\nO.M. When you have a pain in your foot, how do you know it?\r\n\r\nY.M. I feel it.\r\n\r\nO.M. But you do not feel it until a nerve reports the hurt to the brain.\r\nYet the brain is the seat of the mind, is it not?\r\n\r\nY.M. I think so.\r\n\r\nO.M. But isn't spiritual enough to learn what is happening in the\r\noutskirts without the help of the _physical _messenger? You perceive\r\nthat the question of who or what the Me is, is not a simple one at all.\r\nYou say \"I admire the rainbow,\" and \"I believe the world is round,\" and\r\nin these cases we find that the Me is not speaking, but only the _mental\r\n_part. You say, \"I grieve,\" and again the Me is not all speaking, but\r\nonly the _moral _part. You say the mind is wholly spiritual; then\r\nyou say \"I have a pain\" and find that this time the Me is mental _and\r\n_spiritual combined. We all use the \"I\" in this indeterminate fashion,\r\nthere is no help for it. We imagine a Master and King over what you call\r\nThe Whole Thing, and we speak of him as \"I,\" but when we try to define\r\nhim we find we cannot do it. The intellect and the feelings can act\r\nquite _independently _of each other; we recognize that, and we look\r\naround for a Ruler who is master over both, and can serve as a _definite\r\nand indisputable \"I,\" _and enable us to know what we mean and who or\r\nwhat we are talking about when we use that pronoun, but we have to give\r\nit up and confess that we cannot find him. To me, Man is a machine, made\r\nup of many mechanisms, the moral and mental ones acting automatically in\r\naccordance with the impulses of an interior Master who is built out of\r\nborn-temperament and an accumulation of multitudinous outside influences\r\nand trainings; a machine whose _one _function is to secure the spiritual\r\ncontentment of the Master, be his desires good or be they evil; a\r\nmachine whose Will is absolute and must be obeyed, and always _is\r\n_obeyed.\r\n\r\nY.M. Maybe the Me is the Soul?\r\n\r\nO.M. Maybe it is. What is the Soul?\r\n\r\nY.M. I don't know.\r\n\r\nO.M. Neither does any one else.\r\n\r\n_The Master Passion_\r\n\r\nY.M. What is the Master?--or, in common speech, the Conscience? Explain\r\nit.\r\n\r\nO.M. It is that mysterious autocrat, lodged in a man, which compels the\r\nman to content its desires. It may be called the Master Passion--the\r\nhunger for Self-Approval.\r\n\r\nY.M. Where is its seat?\r\n\r\nO.M. In man's moral constitution.\r\n\r\nY.M. Are its commands for the man's good?\r\n\r\nO.M. It is indifferent to the man's good; it never concerns itself about\r\nanything but the satisfying of its own desires. It can be _trained _to\r\nprefer things which will be for the man's good, but it will prefer them\r\nonly because they will content _it _better than other things would.\r\n\r\nY.M. Then even when it is trained to high ideals it is still looking out\r\nfor its own contentment, and not for the man's good.\r\n\r\nO.M. True. Trained or untrained, it cares nothing for the man's good,\r\nand never concerns itself about it.\r\n\r\nY.M. It seems to be an _immoral _force seated in the man's moral\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nO.M. It is a _colorless _force seated in the man's moral constitution.\r\nLet us call it an instinct--a blind, unreasoning instinct, which cannot\r\nand does not distinguish between good morals and bad ones, and cares\r\nnothing for results to the man provided its own contentment be secured;\r\nand it will _always _secure that.\r\n\r\nY.M. It seeks money, and it probably considers that that is an advantage\r\nfor the man?\r\n\r\nO.M. It is not always seeking money, it is not always seeking power, nor\r\noffice, nor any other _material _advantage. In _all _cases it seeks a\r\n_spiritual _contentment, let the _means _be what they may. Its desires\r\nare determined by the man's temperament--and it is lord over that.\r\nTemperament, Conscience, Susceptibility, Spiritual Appetite, are, in\r\nfact, the same thing. Have you ever heard of a person who cared nothing\r\nfor money?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes. A scholar who would not leave his garret and his books to take\r\na place in a business house at a large salary.\r\n\r\nO.M. He had to satisfy his master--that is to say, his temperament, his\r\nSpiritual Appetite--and it preferred books to money. Are there other\r\ncases?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes, the hermit.\r\n\r\nO.M. It is a good instance. The hermit endures solitude, hunger, cold,\r\nand manifold perils, to content his autocrat, who prefers these things,\r\nand prayer and contemplation, to money or to any show or luxury that\r\nmoney can buy. Are there others?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes. The artist, the poet, the scientist.\r\n\r\nO.M. Their autocrat prefers the deep pleasures of these occupations,\r\neither well paid or ill paid, to any others in the market, at any\r\nprice. You _realize _that the Master Passion--the contentment of the\r\nspirit--concerns itself with many things besides so-called material\r\nadvantage, material prosperity, cash, and all that?\r\n\r\nY.M. I think I must concede it.\r\n\r\nO.M. I believe you must. There are perhaps as many Temperaments that\r\nwould refuse the burdens and vexations and distinctions of public office\r\nas there are that hunger after them. The one set of Temperaments seek\r\nthe contentment of the spirit, and that alone; and this is exactly\r\nthe case with the other set. Neither set seeks anything _but _the\r\ncontentment of the spirit. If the one is sordid, both are sordid; and\r\nequally so, since the end in view is precisely the same in both cases.\r\nAnd in both cases Temperament decides the preference--and Temperament is\r\n_born_, not made.\r\n\r\n_Conclusion_\r\n\r\nO.M. You have been taking a holiday?\r\n\r\nY.M. Yes; a mountain tramp covering a week. Are you ready to talk?\r\n\r\nO.M. Quite ready. What shall we begin with?\r\n\r\nY.M. Well, lying abed resting up, two days and nights, I have thought\r\nover all these talks, and passed them carefully in review. With this\r\nresult: that... that... are you intending to publish your notions about\r\nMan some day?\r\n\r\nO.M. Now and then, in these past twenty years, the Master inside of me\r\nhas half-intended to order me to set them to paper and publish them.\r\nDo I have to tell you why the order has remained unissued, or can you\r\nexplain so simple a thing without my help?\r\n\r\nY.M. By your doctrine, it is simplicity itself: outside influences moved\r\nyour interior Master to give the order; stronger outside influences\r\ndeterred him. Without the outside influences, neither of these impulses\r\ncould ever have been born, since a person's brain is incapable or\r\noriginating an idea within itself.\r\n\r\nO.M. Correct. Go on.\r\n\r\nY.M. The matter of publishing or withholding is still in your Master's\r\nhands. If some day an outside influence shall determine him to publish,\r\nhe will give the order, and it will be obeyed.\r\n\r\nO.M. That is correct. Well?\r\n\r\nY.M. Upon reflection I have arrived at the conviction that the\r\npublication of your doctrines would be harmful. Do you pardon me?\r\n\r\nO.M. Pardon _you_? You have done nothing. You are an instrument--a\r\nspeaking-trumpet. Speaking-trumpets are not responsible for what is said\r\nthrough them. Outside influences--in the form of lifelong teachings,\r\ntrainings, notions, prejudices, and other second-hand importations--have\r\npersuaded the Master within you that the publication of these doctrines\r\nwould be harmful. Very well, this is quite natural, and was to be\r\nexpected; in fact, was inevitable. Go on; for the sake of ease and\r\nconvenience, stick to habit: speak in the first person, and tell me what\r\nyour Master thinks about it.\r\n\r\nY.M. Well, to begin: it is a desolating doctrine; it is not inspiring,\r\nenthusing, uplifting. It takes the glory out of man, it takes the pride\r\nout of him, it takes the heroism out of him, it denies him all personal\r\ncredit, all applause; it not only degrades him to a machine, but allows\r\nhim no control over the machine; makes a mere coffee-mill of him, and\r\nneither permits him to supply the coffee nor turn the crank, his sole\r\nand piteously humble function being to grind coarse or fine, according\r\nto his make, outside impulses doing the rest.\r\n\r\nO.M. It is correctly stated. Tell me--what do men admire most in each\r\nother?\r\n\r\nY.M. Intellect, courage, majesty of build, beauty of countenance,\r\ncharity, benevolence, magnanimity, kindliness, heroism, and--and--\r\n\r\nO.M. I would not go any further. These are _elementals_. Virtue,\r\nfortitude, holiness, truthfulness, loyalty, high ideals--these, and all\r\nthe related qualities that are named in the dictionary, are _made of the\r\nelementals, _by blendings, combinations, and shadings of the elementals,\r\njust as one makes green by blending blue and yellow, and makes several\r\nshades and tints of red by modifying the elemental red. There are\r\nseveral elemental colors; they are all in the rainbow; out of them we\r\nmanufacture and name fifty shades of them. You have named the elementals\r\nof the human rainbow, and also one _blend _--heroism, which is made out\r\nof courage and magnanimity. Very well, then; which of these elements\r\ndoes the possessor of it manufacture for himself? Is it intellect?\r\n\r\nY.M. No.\r\n\r\nO.M. Why?\r\n\r\nY.M. He is born with it.\r\n\r\nO.M. Is it courage?\r\n\r\nY.M. No. He is born with it.\r\n\r\nO.M. Is it majesty of build, beauty of countenance?\r\n\r\nY.M. No. They are birthrights.\r\n\r\nO.M. Take those others--the elemental moral qualities--charity,\r\nbenevolence, magnanimity, kindliness; fruitful seeds, out of which\r\nspring, through cultivation by outside influences, all the manifold\r\nblends and combinations of virtues named in the dictionaries: does man\r\nmanufacture any of those seeds, or are they all born in him?\r\n\r\nY.M. Born in him.\r\n\r\nO.M. Who manufactures them, then?\r\n\r\nY.M. God.\r\n\r\nO.M. Where does the credit of it belong?\r\n\r\nY.M. To God.\r\n\r\nO.M. And the glory of which you spoke, and the applause?\r\n\r\nY.M. To God.\r\n\r\nO.M. Then it is _you _who degrade man. You make him claim glory, praise,\r\nflattery, for every valuable thing he possesses--_borrowed _finery, the\r\nwhole of it; no rag of it earned by himself, not a detail of it produced\r\nby his own labor. _You _make man a humbug; have I done worse by him?\r\n\r\nY.M. You have made a machine of him.\r\n\r\nO.M. Who devised that cunning and beautiful mechanism, a man's hand?\r\n\r\nY.M. God.\r\n\r\nO.M. Who devised the law by which it automatically hammers out of a\r\npiano an elaborate piece of music, without error, while the man is\r\nthinking about something else, or talking to a friend?\r\n\r\nY.M. God.\r\n\r\nO.M. Who devised the blood? Who devised the wonderful machinery which\r\nautomatically drives its renewing and refreshing streams through the\r\nbody, day and night, without assistance or advice from the man? Who\r\ndevised the man's mind, whose machinery works automatically, interests\r\nitself in what it pleases, regardless of its will or desire, labors\r\nall night when it likes, deaf to his appeals for mercy? God devised all\r\nthese things. _I_ have not made man a machine, God made him a machine.\r\nI am merely calling attention to the fact, nothing more. Is it wrong to\r\ncall attention to the fact? Is it a crime?\r\n\r\nY.M. I think it is wrong to _expose _a fact when harm can come of it.\r\n\r\nO.M. Go on.\r\n\r\nY.M. Look at the matter as it stands now. Man has been taught that he is\r\nthe supreme marvel of the Creation; he believes it; in all the ages\r\nhe has never doubted it, whether he was a naked savage, or clothed in\r\npurple and fine linen, and civilized. This has made his heart buoyant,\r\nhis life cheery. His pride in himself, his sincere admiration of\r\nhimself, his joy in what he supposed were his own and unassisted\r\nachievements, and his exultation over the praise and applause which they\r\nevoked--these have exalted him, enthused him, ambitioned him to higher\r\nand higher flights; in a word, made his life worth the living. But by\r\nyour scheme, all this is abolished; he is degraded to a machine, he is\r\na nobody, his noble prides wither to mere vanities; let him strive as\r\nhe may, he can never be any better than his humblest and stupidest\r\nneighbor; he would never be cheerful again, his life would not be worth\r\nthe living.\r\n\r\nO.M. You really think that?\r\n\r\nY.M. I certainly do.\r\n\r\nO.M. Have you ever seen me uncheerful, unhappy.\r\n\r\nY.M. No.\r\n\r\nO.M. Well, _I_ believe these things. Why have they not made me unhappy?\r\n\r\nY.M. Oh, well--temperament, of course! You never let _that _escape from\r\nyour scheme.\r\n\r\nO.M. That is correct. If a man is born with an unhappy temperament,\r\nnothing can make him happy; if he is born with a happy temperament,\r\nnothing can make him unhappy.\r\n\r\nY.M. What--not even a degrading and heart-chilling system of beliefs?\r\n\r\nO.M. Beliefs? Mere beliefs? Mere convictions? They are powerless. They\r\nstrive in vain against inborn temperament.\r\n\r\nY.M. I can't believe that, and I don't.\r\n\r\nO.M. Now you are speaking hastily. It shows that you have not studiously\r\nexamined the facts. Of all your intimates, which one is the happiest?\r\nIsn't it Burgess?\r\n\r\nY.M. Easily.\r\n\r\nO.M. And which one is the unhappiest? Henry Adams?\r\n\r\nY.M. Without a question!\r\n\r\nO.M. I know them well. They are extremes, abnormals; their temperaments\r\nare as opposite as the poles. Their life-histories are about alike--but\r\nlook at the results! Their ages are about the same--about around fifty.\r\nBurgess had always been buoyant, hopeful, happy; Adams has always been\r\ncheerless, hopeless, despondent. As young fellows both tried country\r\njournalism--and failed. Burgess didn't seem to mind it; Adams couldn't\r\nsmile, he could only mourn and groan over what had happened and torture\r\nhimself with vain regrets for not having done so and so instead of so\r\nand so--_then _he would have succeeded. They tried the law--and\r\nfailed. Burgess remained happy--because he couldn't help it. Adams was\r\nwretched--because he couldn't help it. From that day to this, those two\r\nmen have gone on trying things and failing: Burgess has come out happy\r\nand cheerful every time; Adams the reverse. And we do absolutely know\r\nthat these men's inborn temperaments have remained unchanged through all\r\nthe vicissitudes of their material affairs. Let us see how it is with\r\ntheir immaterials. Both have been zealous Democrats; both have been\r\nzealous Republicans; both have been zealous Mugwumps. Burgess has always\r\nfound happiness and Adams unhappiness in these several political\r\nbeliefs and in their migrations out of them. Both of these men have been\r\nPresbyterians, Universalists, Methodists, Catholics--then Presbyterians\r\nagain, then Methodists again. Burgess has always found rest in these\r\nexcursions, and Adams unrest. They are trying Christian Science, now,\r\nwith the customary result, the inevitable result. No political or\r\nreligious belief can make Burgess unhappy or the other man happy.\r\nI assure you it is purely a matter of temperament. Beliefs are\r\n_acquirements_, temperaments are _born_; beliefs are subject to change,\r\nnothing whatever can change temperament.\r\n\r\nY.M. You have instanced extreme temperaments.\r\n\r\nO.M. Yes, the half-dozen others are modifications of the extremes.\r\nBut the law is the same. Where the temperament is two-thirds happy, or\r\ntwo-thirds unhappy, no political or religious beliefs can change the\r\nproportions. The vast majority of temperaments are pretty equally\r\nbalanced; the intensities are absent, and this enables a nation to learn\r\nto accommodate itself to its political and religious circumstances and\r\nlike them, be satisfied with them, at last prefer them. Nations do\r\nnot _think_, they only _feel_. They get their feelings at second\r\nhand through their temperaments, not their brains. A nation can be\r\nbrought--by force of circumstances, not argument--to reconcile itself\r\nto _any kind of government or religion that can be devised; _in time it\r\nwill fit itself to the required conditions; later, it will prefer them\r\nand will fiercely fight for them. As instances, you have all history:\r\nthe Greeks, the Romans, the Persians, the Egyptians, the Russians, the\r\nGermans, the French, the English, the Spaniards, the Americans, the\r\nSouth Americans, the Japanese, the Chinese, the Hindus, the Turks--a\r\nthousand wild and tame religions, every kind of government that can be\r\nthought of, from tiger to house-cat, each nation _knowing _it has\r\nthe only true religion and the only sane system of government, each\r\ndespising all the others, each an ass and not suspecting it, each proud\r\nof its fancied supremacy, each perfectly sure it is the pet of God, each\r\nwithout undoubting confidence summoning Him to take command in time of\r\nwar, each surprised when He goes over to the enemy, but by habit able\r\nto excuse it and resume compliments--in a word, the whole human race\r\ncontent, always content, persistently content, indestructibly content,\r\nhappy, thankful, proud, _no matter what its religion is, nor whether its\r\nmaster be tiger or house-cat. _Am I stating facts? You know I am. Is the\r\nhuman race cheerful? You know it is. Considering what it can stand, and\r\nbe happy, you do me too much honor when you think that _I_ can place\r\nbefore it a system of plain cold facts that can take the cheerfulness\r\nout of it. Nothing can do that. Everything has been tried. Without\r\nsuccess. I beg you not to be troubled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH OF JEAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of Jean Clemens occurred early in the morning of December 24,\r\n1909. Mr. Clemens was in great stress of mind when I first saw him, but\r\na few hours later I found him writing steadily.\r\n\r\n\"I am setting it down,\" he said, \"everything. It is a relief to me to\r\nwrite it. It furnishes me an excuse for thinking.\" At intervals during\r\nthat day and the next I looked in, and usually found him writing. Then\r\non the evening of the 26th, when he knew that Jean had been laid to rest\r\nin Elmira, he came to my room with the manuscript in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"I have finished it,\" he said; \"read it. I can form no opinion of it\r\nmyself. If you think it worthy, some day--at the proper time--it can end\r\nmy autobiography. It is the final chapter.\"\r\n\r\nFour months later--almost to the day--(April 21st) he was with Jean.\r\n\r\nAlbert Bigelow Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStormfield, Christmas Eve, 11 A.M., 1909.\r\n\r\nJEAN IS DEAD!\r\n\r\nHas any one ever tried to put upon paper all the little happenings\r\nconnected with a dear one--happenings of the twenty-four hours preceding\r\nthe sudden and unexpected death of that dear one? Would a book contain\r\nthem? Would two books contain them? I think not. They pour into the mind\r\nin a flood. They are little things that have been always happening every\r\nday, and were always so unimportant and easily forgettable before--but\r\nnow! Now, how different! how precious they are, how dear, how\r\nunforgettable, how pathetic, how sacred, how clothed with dignity!\r\n\r\nLast night Jean, all flushed with splendid health, and I the same, from\r\nthe wholesome effects of my Bermuda holiday, strolled hand in hand from\r\nthe dinner-table and sat down in the library and chatted, and planned,\r\nand discussed, cheerily and happily (and how unsuspectingly!)--until\r\nnine--which is late for us--then went upstairs, Jean's friendly German\r\ndog following. At my door Jean said, \"I can't kiss you good night,\r\nfather: I have a cold, and you could catch it.\" I bent and kissed her\r\nhand. She was moved--I saw it in her eyes--and she impulsively kissed my\r\nhand in return. Then with the usual gay \"Sleep well, dear!\" from both,\r\nwe parted.\r\n\r\nAt half past seven this morning I woke, and heard voices outside my\r\ndoor. I said to myself, \"Jean is starting on her usual horseback flight\r\nto the station for the mail.\" Then Katy (1) entered, stood quaking and\r\ngasping at my bedside a moment, then found her tongue:\r\n\r\n\"MISS JEAN IS DEAD!\"\r\n\r\nPossibly I know now what the soldier feels when a bullet crashes through\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\nIn her bathroom there she lay, the fair young creature, stretched upon\r\nthe floor and covered with a sheet. And looking so placid, so natural,\r\nand as if asleep. We knew what had happened. She was an epileptic: she\r\nhad been seized with a convulsion and heart failure in her bath. The\r\ndoctor had to come several miles. His efforts, like our previous ones,\r\nfailed to bring her back to life.\r\n\r\nIt is noon, now. How lovable she looks, how sweet and how tranquil! It\r\nis a noble face, and full of dignity; and that was a good heart that\r\nlies there so still.\r\n\r\nIn England, thirteen years ago, my wife and I were stabbed to the heart\r\nwith a cablegram which said, \"Susy was mercifully released today.\" I\r\nhad to send a like shot to Clara, in Berlin, this morning. With the\r\nperemptory addition, \"You must not come home.\" Clara and her husband\r\nsailed from here on the 11th of this month. How will Clara bear it?\r\nJean, from her babyhood, was a worshiper of Clara.\r\n\r\nFour days ago I came back from a month's holiday in Bermuda in perfected\r\nhealth; but by some accident the reporters failed to perceive this. Day\r\nbefore yesterday, letters and telegrams began to arrive from friends\r\nand strangers which indicated that I was supposed to be dangerously\r\nill. Yesterday Jean begged me to explain my case through the Associated\r\nPress. I said it was not important enough; but she was distressed and\r\nsaid I must think of Clara. Clara would see the report in the German\r\npapers, and as she had been nursing her husband day and night for four\r\nmonths (2) and was worn out and feeble, the shock might be disastrous.\r\nThere was reason in that; so I sent a humorous paragraph by telephone to\r\nthe Associated Press denying the \"charge\" that I was \"dying,\" and saying\r\n\"I would not do such a thing at my time of life.\"\r\n\r\nJean was a little troubled, and did not like to see me treat the matter\r\nso lightly; but I said it was best to treat it so, for there was nothing\r\nserious about it. This morning I sent the sorrowful facts of this day's\r\nirremediable disaster to the Associated Press. Will both appear in this\r\nevening's papers?--the one so blithe, the other so tragic?\r\n\r\nI lost Susy thirteen years ago; I lost her mother--her incomparable\r\nmother!--five and a half years ago; Clara has gone away to live in\r\nEurope; and now I have lost Jean. How poor I am, who was once so rich!\r\nSeven months ago Mr. Rogers died--one of the best friends I ever had, and\r\nthe nearest perfect, as man and gentleman, I have yet met among my race;\r\nwithin the last six weeks Gilder has passed away, and Laffan--old, old\r\nfriends of mine. Jean lies yonder, I sit here; we are strangers under\r\nour own roof; we kissed hands good-by at this door last night--and\r\nit was forever, we never suspecting it. She lies there, and I sit\r\nhere--writing, busying myself, to keep my heart from breaking. How\r\ndazzlingly the sunshine is flooding the hills around! It is like a\r\nmockery.\r\n\r\nSeventy-four years old twenty-four days ago. Seventy-four years old\r\nyesterday. Who can estimate my age today?\r\n\r\nI have looked upon her again. I wonder I can bear it. She looks just\r\nas her mother looked when she lay dead in that Florentine villa so long\r\nago. The sweet placidity of death! it is more beautiful than sleep.\r\n\r\nI saw her mother buried. I said I would never endure that horror again;\r\nthat I would never again look into the grave of any one dear to me. I\r\nhave kept to that. They will take Jean from this house tomorrow, and\r\nbear her to Elmira, New York, where lie those of us that have been\r\nreleased, but I shall not follow.\r\n\r\nJean was on the dock when the ship came in, only four days ago. She\r\nwas at the door, beaming a welcome, when I reached this house the next\r\nevening. We played cards, and she tried to teach me a new game called\r\n\"Mark Twain.\" We sat chatting cheerily in the library last night, and\r\nshe wouldn't let me look into the loggia, where she was making Christmas\r\npreparations. She said she would finish them in the morning, and then\r\nher little French friend would arrive from New York--the surprise would\r\nfollow; the surprise she had been working over for days. While she was\r\nout for a moment I disloyally stole a look. The loggia floor was clothed\r\nwith rugs and furnished with chairs and sofas; and the uncompleted\r\nsurprise was there: in the form of a Christmas tree that was drenched\r\nwith silver film in a most wonderful way; and on a table was a prodigal\r\nprofusion of bright things which she was going to hang upon it today.\r\nWhat desecrating hand will ever banish that eloquent unfinished surprise\r\nfrom that place? Not mine, surely. All these little matters have\r\nhappened in the last four days. \"Little.\" Yes--THEN. But not now.\r\nNothing she said or thought or did is little now. And all the lavish\r\nhumor!--what is become of it? It is pathos, now. Pathos, and the thought\r\nof it brings tears.\r\n\r\nAll these little things happened such a few hours ago--and now she\r\nlies yonder. Lies yonder, and cares for nothing any more.\r\nStrange--marvelous--incredible! I have had this experience before; but\r\nit would still be incredible if I had had it a thousand times.\r\n\r\n\"MISS JEAN IS DEAD!\"\r\n\r\nThat is what Katy said. When I heard the door open behind the bed's head\r\nwithout a preliminary knock, I supposed it was Jean coming to kiss me\r\ngood morning, she being the only person who was used to entering without\r\nformalities.\r\n\r\nAnd so--\r\n\r\nI have been to Jean's parlor. Such a turmoil of Christmas presents for\r\nservants and friends! They are everywhere; tables, chairs, sofas, the\r\nfloor--everything is occupied, and over-occupied. It is many and many a\r\nyear since I have seen the like. In that ancient day Mrs. Clemens and\r\nI used to slip softly into the nursery at midnight on Christmas Eve and\r\nlook the array of presents over. The children were little then. And now\r\nhere is Jean's parlor looking just as that nursery used to look. The\r\npresents are not labeled--the hands are forever idle that would have\r\nlabeled them today. Jean's mother always worked herself down with her\r\nChristmas preparations. Jean did the same yesterday and the preceding\r\ndays, and the fatigue has cost her her life. The fatigue caused the\r\nconvulsion that attacked her this morning. She had had no attack for\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nJean was so full of life and energy that she was constantly in danger\r\nof overtaxing her strength. Every morning she was in the saddle by\r\nhalf past seven, and off to the station for her mail. She examined the\r\nletters and I distributed them: some to her, some to Mr. Paine, the\r\nothers to the stenographer and myself. She dispatched her share and then\r\nmounted her horse again and went around superintending her farm and\r\nher poultry the rest of the day. Sometimes she played billiards with me\r\nafter dinner, but she was usually too tired to play, and went early to\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nYesterday afternoon I told her about some plans I had been devising\r\nwhile absent in Bermuda, to lighten her burdens. We would get a\r\nhousekeeper; also we would put her share of the secretary-work into Mr.\r\nPaine's hands.\r\n\r\nNo--she wasn't willing. She had been making plans herself. The matter\r\nended in a compromise, I submitted. I always did. She wouldn't audit the\r\nbills and let Paine fill out the checks--she would continue to attend to\r\nthat herself. Also, she would continue to be housekeeper, and let Katy\r\nassist. Also, she would continue to answer the letters of personal\r\nfriends for me. Such was the compromise. Both of us called it by that\r\nname, though I was not able to see where any formidable change had been\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nHowever, Jean was pleased, and that was sufficient for me. She was proud\r\nof being my secretary, and I was never able to persuade her to give up\r\nany part of her share in that unlovely work.\r\n\r\nIn the talk last night I said I found everything going so smoothly\r\nthat if she were willing I would go back to Bermuda in February and get\r\nblessedly out of the clash and turmoil again for another month. She was\r\nurgent that I should do it, and said that if I would put off the trip\r\nuntil March she would take Katy and go with me. We struck hands upon\r\nthat, and said it was settled. I had a mind to write to Bermuda by\r\ntomorrow's ship and secure a furnished house and servants. I meant to\r\nwrite the letter this morning. But it will never be written, now.\r\n\r\nFor she lies yonder, and before her is another journey than that.\r\n\r\nNight is closing down; the rim of the sun barely shows above the\r\nsky-line of the hills.\r\n\r\nI have been looking at that face again that was growing dearer and\r\ndearer to me every day. I was getting acquainted with Jean in these last\r\nnine months. She had been long an exile from home when she came to us\r\nthree-quarters of a year ago. She had been shut up in sanitariums,\r\nmany miles from us. How eloquently glad and grateful she was to cross her\r\nfather's threshold again!\r\n\r\nWould I bring her back to life if I could do it? I would not. If a word\r\nwould do it, I would beg for strength to withhold the word. And I would\r\nhave the strength; I am sure of it. In her loss I am almost bankrupt,\r\nand my life is a bitterness, but I am content: for she has been enriched\r\nwith the most precious of all gifts--that gift which makes all other\r\ngifts mean and poor--death. I have never wanted any released friend of\r\nmine restored to life since I reached manhood. I felt in this way when\r\nSusy passed away; and later my wife, and later Mr. Rogers. When Clara\r\nmet me at the station in New York and told me Mr. Rogers had\r\ndied suddenly that morning, my thought was, Oh, favorite of\r\nfortune--fortunate all his long and lovely life--fortunate to his\r\nlatest moment! The reporters said there were tears of sorrow in my eyes.\r\nTrue--but they were for ME, not for him. He had suffered no loss. All\r\nthe fortunes he had ever made before were poverty compared with this\r\none.\r\n\r\nWhy did I build this house, two years ago? To shelter this vast\r\nemptiness? How foolish I was! But I shall stay in it. The spirits of\r\nthe dead hallow a house, for me. It was not so with other members of my\r\nfamily. Susy died in the house we built in Hartford. Mrs. Clemens would\r\nnever enter it again. But it made the house dearer to me. I have entered\r\nit once since, when it was tenantless and silent and forlorn, but to me\r\nit was a holy place and beautiful. It seemed to me that the spirits of\r\nthe dead were all about me, and would speak to me and welcome me if\r\nthey could: Livy, and Susy, and George, and Henry Robinson, and Charles\r\nDudley Warner. How good and kind they were, and how lovable their lives!\r\nIn fancy I could see them all again, I could call the children back\r\nand hear them romp again with George--that peerless black ex-slave and\r\nchildren's idol who came one day--a flitting stranger--to wash windows,\r\nand stayed eighteen years. Until he died. Clara and Jean would never\r\nenter again the New York hotel which their mother had frequented in\r\nearlier days. They could not bear it. But I shall stay in this house. It\r\nis dearer to me tonight than ever it was before. Jean's spirit will make\r\nit beautiful for me always. Her lonely and tragic death--but I will not\r\nthink of that now.\r\n\r\nJean's mother always devoted two or three weeks to Christmas shopping,\r\nand was always physically exhausted when Christmas Eve came. Jean was\r\nher very own child--she wore herself out present-hunting in New York\r\nthese latter days. Paine has just found on her desk a long list of\r\nnames--fifty, he thinks--people to whom she sent presents last night.\r\nApparently she forgot no one. And Katy found there a roll of bank-notes,\r\nfor the servants.\r\n\r\nHer dog has been wandering about the grounds today, comradeless and\r\nforlorn. I have seen him from the windows. She got him from Germany. He\r\nhas tall ears and looks exactly like a wolf. He was educated in Germany,\r\nand knows no language but the German. Jean gave him no orders save\r\nin that tongue. And so when the burglar-alarm made a fierce clamor at\r\nmidnight a fortnight ago, the butler, who is French and knows no German,\r\ntried in vain to interest the dog in the supposed burglar. Jean wrote\r\nme, to Bermuda, about the incident. It was the last letter I was ever to\r\nreceive from her bright head and her competent hand. The dog will not be\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nThere was never a kinder heart than Jean's. From her childhood up she\r\nalways spent the most of her allowance on charities of one kind and\r\nanother. After she became secretary and had her income doubled she spent\r\nher money upon these things with a free hand. Mine too, I am glad and\r\ngrateful to say.\r\n\r\nShe was a loyal friend to all animals, and she loved them all, birds,\r\nbeasts, and everything--even snakes--an inheritance from me. She knew\r\nall the birds; she was high up in that lore. She became a member of\r\nvarious humane societies when she was still a little girl--both here and\r\nabroad--and she remained an active member to the last. She founded two\r\nor three societies for the protection of animals, here and in Europe.\r\n\r\nShe was an embarrassing secretary, for she fished my correspondence out\r\nof the waste-basket and answered the letters. She thought all letters\r\ndeserved the courtesy of an answer. Her mother brought her up in that\r\nkindly error.\r\n\r\nShe could write a good letter, and was swift with her pen. She had but\r\nan indifferent ear for music, but her tongue took to languages with an easy\r\nfacility. She never allowed her Italian, French, and German to get rusty\r\nthrough neglect.\r\n\r\nThe telegrams of sympathy are flowing in, from far and wide, now, just\r\nas they did in Italy five years and a half ago, when this child's mother\r\nlaid down her blameless life. They cannot heal the hurt, but they take\r\naway some of the pain. When Jean and I kissed hands and parted at\r\nmy door last, how little did we imagine that in twenty-two hours the\r\ntelegraph would be bringing words like these:\r\n\r\n\"From the bottom of our hearts we send our sympathy, dearest of\r\nfriends.\"\r\n\r\nFor many and many a day to come, wherever I go in this house,\r\nremembrancers of Jean will mutely speak to me of her. Who can count the\r\nnumber of them?\r\n\r\nShe was in exile two years with the hope of healing her\r\nmalady--epilepsy. There are no words to express how grateful I am that\r\nshe did not meet her fate in the hands of strangers, but in the loving\r\nshelter of her own home.\r\n\r\n\"MISS JEAN IS DEAD!\"\r\n\r\nIt is true. Jean is dead.\r\n\r\nA month ago I was writing bubbling and hilarious articles for magazines\r\nyet to appear, and now I am writing--this.\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS DAY. NOON.--Last night I went to Jean's room at intervals, and\r\nturned back the sheet and looked at the peaceful face, and kissed the\r\ncold brow, and remembered that heartbreaking night in Florence so long\r\nago, in that cavernous and silent vast villa, when I crept downstairs so\r\nmany times, and turned back a sheet and looked at a face just like this\r\none--Jean's mother's face--and kissed a brow that was just like this\r\none. And last night I saw again what I had seen then--that strange and\r\nlovely miracle--the sweet, soft contours of early maidenhood restored\r\nby the gracious hand of death! When Jean's mother lay dead, all trace of\r\ncare, and trouble, and suffering, and the corroding years had vanished\r\nout of the face, and I was looking again upon it as I had known and\r\nworshiped it in its young bloom and beauty a whole generation before.\r\n\r\nAbout three in the morning, while wandering about the house in the deep\r\nsilences, as one does in times like these, when there is a dumb sense\r\nthat something has been lost that will never be found again, yet must\r\nbe sought, if only for the employment the useless seeking gives, I came\r\nupon Jean's dog in the hall downstairs, and noted that he did not\r\nspring to greet me, according to his hospitable habit, but came slow and\r\nsorrowfully; also I remembered that he had not visited Jean's apartment\r\nsince the tragedy. Poor fellow, did he know? I think so. Always when\r\nJean was abroad in the open he was with her; always when she was in the\r\nhouse he was with her, in the night as well as in the day. Her parlor\r\nwas his bedroom. Whenever I happened upon him on the ground floor he\r\nalways followed me about, and when I went upstairs he went too--in a\r\ntumultuous gallop. But now it was different: after patting him a little\r\nI went to the library--he remained behind; when I went upstairs he did\r\nnot follow me, save with his wistful eyes. He has wonderful eyes--big,\r\nand kind, and eloquent. He can talk with them. He is a beautiful\r\ncreature, and is of the breed of the New York police-dogs. I do not like\r\ndogs, because they bark when there is no occasion for it; but I have\r\nliked this one from the beginning, because he belonged to Jean, and\r\nbecause he never barks except when there is occasion--which is not\r\noftener than twice a week.\r\n\r\nIn my wanderings I visited Jean's parlor. On a shelf I found a pile of\r\nmy books, and I knew what it meant. She was waiting for me to come home\r\nfrom Bermuda and autograph them, then she would send them away. If I\r\nonly knew whom she intended them for! But I shall never know. I will\r\nkeep them. Her hand has touched them--it is an accolade--they are noble,\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nAnd in a closet she had hidden a surprise for me--a thing I have often\r\nwished I owned: a noble big globe. I couldn't see it for the tears.\r\nShe will never know the pride I take in it, and the pleasure. Today the\r\nmails are full of loving remembrances for her: full of those old, old\r\nkind words she loved so well, \"Merry Christmas to Jean!\" If she could\r\nonly have lived one day longer!\r\n\r\nAt last she ran out of money, and would not use mine. So she sent to\r\none of those New York homes for poor girls all the clothes she could\r\nspare--and more, most likely.\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS NIGHT.--This afternoon they took her away from her room. As\r\nsoon as I might, I went down to the library, and there she lay, in her\r\ncoffin, dressed in exactly the same clothes she wore when she stood at\r\nthe other end of the same room on the 6th of October last, as Clara's\r\nchief bridesmaid. Her face was radiant with happy excitement then; it\r\nwas the same face now, with the dignity of death and the peace of God\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nThey told me the first mourner to come was the dog. He came uninvited,\r\nand stood up on his hind legs and rested his fore paws upon the trestle,\r\nand took a last long look at the face that was so dear to him, then went\r\nhis way as silently as he had come. HE KNOWS.\r\n\r\nAt mid-afternoon it began to snow. The pity of it--that Jean could not\r\nsee it! She so loved the snow.\r\n\r\nThe snow continued to fall. At six o'clock the hearse drew up to the\r\ndoor to bear away its pathetic burden. As they lifted the casket, Paine\r\nbegan playing on the orchestrelle Schubert's \"Impromptu,\" which was\r\nJean's favorite. Then he played the Intermezzo; that was for Susy;\r\nthen he played the Largo; that was for their mother. He did this at my\r\nrequest. Elsewhere in my Autobiography I have told how the Intermezzo\r\nand the Largo came to be associated in my heart with Susy and Livy in\r\ntheir last hours in this life.\r\n\r\nFrom my windows I saw the hearse and the carriages wind along the road\r\nand gradually grow vague and spectral in the falling snow, and presently\r\ndisappear. Jean was gone out of my life, and would not come back any\r\nmore. Jervis, the cousin she had played with when they were babies\r\ntogether--he and her beloved old Katy--were conducting her to her\r\ndistant childhood home, where she will lie by her mother's side once\r\nmore, in the company of Susy and Langdon.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 26TH. The dog came to see me at eight o'clock this morning.\r\nHe was very affectionate, poor orphan! My room will be his quarters\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nThe storm raged all night. It has raged all the morning. The snow drives\r\nacross the landscape in vast clouds, superb, sublime--and Jean not here\r\nto see.\r\n\r\n2:30 P.M.--It is the time appointed. The funeral has begun. Four hundred\r\nmiles away, but I can see it all, just as if I were there. The scene\r\nis the library in the Langdon homestead. Jean's coffin stands where her\r\nmother and I stood, forty years ago, and were married; and where Susy's\r\ncoffin stood thirteen years ago; where her mother's stood five years and\r\na half ago; and where mine will stand after a little time.\r\n\r\nFIVE O'CLOCK.--It is all over.\r\n\r\nWhen Clara went away two weeks ago to live in Europe, it was hard, but I\r\ncould bear it, for I had Jean left. I said WE would be a family. We said\r\nwe would be close comrades and happy--just we two. That fair dream was\r\nin my mind when Jean met me at the steamer last Monday; it was in my\r\nmind when she received me at the door last Tuesday evening. We were\r\ntogether; WE WERE A FAMILY! the dream had come true--oh, precisely true,\r\ncontentedly, true, satisfyingly true! and remained true two whole days.\r\n\r\nAnd now? Now Jean is in her grave!\r\n\r\nIn the grave--if I can believe it. God rest her sweet spirit!\r\n\r\n     1.  Katy Leary, who had been in the service of the Clemens\r\n     family for twenty-nine years.\r\n\r\n     2.  Mr. Gabrilowitsch had been operated on for appendicitis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TURNING-POINT OF MY LIFE\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIf I understand the idea, the BAZAR invites several of us to write upon\r\nthe above text. It means the change in my life's course which introduced\r\nwhat must be regarded by me as the most IMPORTANT condition of my\r\ncareer. But it also implies--without intention, perhaps--that that\r\nturning-point ITSELF was the creator of the new condition. This gives it\r\ntoo much distinction, too much prominence, too much credit. It is only\r\nthe LAST link in a very long chain of turning-points commissioned to\r\nproduce the cardinal result; it is not any more important than the\r\nhumblest of its ten thousand predecessors. Each of the ten thousand did\r\nits appointed share, on its appointed date, in forwarding the scheme,\r\nand they were all necessary; to have left out any one of them would have\r\ndefeated the scheme and brought about SOME OTHER result. I know we have\r\na fashion of saying \"such and such an event was the turning-point in my\r\nlife,\" but we shouldn't say it. We should merely grant that its place\r\nas LAST link in the chain makes it the most CONSPICUOUS link; in real\r\nimportance it has no advantage over any one of its predecessors.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most celebrated turning-point recorded in history was the\r\ncrossing of the Rubicon. Suetonius says:\r\n\r\nComing up with his troops on the banks of the Rubicon, he halted for a\r\nwhile, and, revolving in his mind the importance of the step he was\r\non the point of taking, he turned to those about him and said, \"We may\r\nstill retreat; but if we pass this little bridge, nothing is left for us\r\nbut to fight it out in arms.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a stupendously important moment. And all the incidents, big and\r\nlittle, of Caesar's previous life had been leading up to it, stage by\r\nstage, link by link. This was the LAST link--merely the last one, and no\r\nbigger than the others; but as we gaze back at it through the inflating\r\nmists of our imagination, it looks as big as the orbit of Neptune.\r\n\r\nYou, the reader, have a PERSONAL interest in that link, and so have\r\nI; so has the rest of the human race. It was one of the links in your\r\nlife-chain, and it was one of the links in mine. We may wait, now, with\r\nbated breath, while Caesar reflects. Your fate and mine are involved in\r\nhis decision.\r\n\r\nWhile he was thus hesitating, the following incident occurred. A person\r\nremarked for his noble mien and graceful aspect appeared close at hand,\r\nsitting and playing upon a pipe. When not only the shepherds, but a\r\nnumber of soldiers also, flocked to listen to him, and some trumpeters\r\namong them, he snatched a trumpet from one of them, ran to the river\r\nwith it, and, sounding the advance with a piercing blast, crossed to the\r\nother side. Upon this, Caesar exclaimed: \"Let us go whither the omens of\r\nthe gods and the iniquity of our enemies call us. THE DIE IS CAST.\"\r\n\r\nSo he crossed--and changed the future of the whole human race, for all\r\ntime. But that stranger was a link in Caesar's life-chain, too; and a\r\nnecessary one. We don't know his name, we never hear of him again; he\r\nwas very casual; he acts like an accident; but he was no accident, he\r\nwas there by compulsion of HIS life-chain, to blow the electrifying\r\nblast that was to make up Caesar's mind for him, and thence go piping\r\ndown the aisles of history forever.\r\n\r\nIf the stranger hadn't been there! But he WAS. And Caesar crossed.\r\nWith such results! Such vast events--each a link in the HUMAN RACE'S\r\nlife-chain; each event producing the next one, and that one the next\r\none, and so on: the destruction of the republic; the founding of the\r\nempire; the breaking up of the empire; the rise of Christianity upon\r\nits ruins; the spread of the religion to other lands--and so on; link\r\nby link took its appointed place at its appointed time, the discovery of\r\nAmerica being one of them; our Revolution another; the inflow of English\r\nand other immigrants another; their drift westward (my ancestors among\r\nthem) another; the settlement of certain of them in Missouri, which\r\nresulted in ME. For I was one of the unavoidable results of the crossing\r\nof the Rubicon. If the stranger, with his trumpet blast, had stayed away\r\n(which he COULDN'T, for he was an appointed link) Caesar would not have\r\ncrossed. What would have happened, in that case, we can never guess. We\r\nonly know that the things that did happen would not have happened. They\r\nmight have been replaced by equally prodigious things, of course, but\r\ntheir nature and results are beyond our guessing. But the matter that\r\ninterests me personally is that I would not be HERE now, but somewhere\r\nelse; and probably black--there is no telling. Very well, I am glad he\r\ncrossed. And very really and thankfully glad, too, though I never cared\r\nanything about it before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTo me, the most important feature of my life is its literary feature. I\r\nhave been professionally literary something more than forty years. There\r\nhave been many turning-points in my life, but the one that was the last link\r\nin the chain appointed to conduct me to the literary guild is the most\r\nCONSPICUOUS link in that chain. BECAUSE it was the last one. It was not\r\nany more important than its predecessors. All the other links have an\r\ninconspicuous look, except the crossing of the Rubicon; but as factors\r\nin making me literary they are all of the one size, the crossing of the\r\nRubicon included.\r\n\r\nI know how I came to be literary, and I will tell the steps that lead up\r\nto it and brought it about.\r\n\r\nThe crossing of the Rubicon was not the first one, it was hardly even\r\na recent one; I should have to go back ages before Caesar's day to find\r\nthe first one. To save space I will go back only a couple of generations\r\nand start with an incident of my boyhood. When I was twelve and a half\r\nyears old, my father died. It was in the spring. The summer came, and\r\nbrought with it an epidemic of measles. For a time a child died almost\r\nevery day. The village was paralyzed with fright, distress, despair.\r\nChildren that were not smitten with the disease were imprisoned in\r\ntheir homes to save them from the infection. In the homes there were no\r\ncheerful faces, there was no music, there was no singing but of solemn\r\nhymns, no voice but of prayer, no romping was allowed, no noise, no\r\nlaughter, the family moved spectrally about on tiptoe, in a\r\nghostly hush. I was a prisoner. My soul was steeped in this awful\r\ndreariness--and in fear. At some time or other every day and every night\r\na sudden shiver shook me to the marrow, and I said to myself, \"There,\r\nI've got it! and I shall die.\" Life on these miserable terms was not\r\nworth living, and at last I made up my mind to get the disease and have\r\nit over, one way or the other. I escaped from the house and went to\r\nthe house of a neighbor where a playmate of mine was very ill with the\r\nmalady. When the chance offered I crept into his room and got into bed\r\nwith him. I was discovered by his mother and sent back into captivity.\r\nBut I had the disease; they could not take that from me. I came near to\r\ndying. The whole village was interested, and anxious, and sent for news\r\nof me every day; and not only once a day, but several times. Everybody\r\nbelieved I would die; but on the fourteenth day a change came for the\r\nworse and they were disappointed.\r\n\r\nThis was a turning-point of my life. (Link number one.) For when I got\r\nwell my mother closed my school career and apprenticed me to a printer.\r\nShe was tired of trying to keep me out of mischief, and the adventure of\r\nthe measles decided her to put me into more masterful hands than hers.\r\n\r\nI became a printer, and began to add one link after another to the chain\r\nwhich was to lead me into the literary profession. A long road, but I\r\ncould not know that; and as I did not know what its goal was, or even\r\nthat it had one, I was indifferent. Also contented.\r\n\r\nA young printer wanders around a good deal, seeking and finding work;\r\nand seeking again, when necessity commands. N. B. Necessity is a\r\nCIRCUMSTANCE; Circumstance is man's master--and when Circumstance\r\ncommands, he must obey; he may argue the matter--that is his privilege,\r\njust as it is the honorable privilege of a falling body to argue with\r\nthe attraction of gravitation--but it won't do any good, he must OBEY.\r\nI wandered for ten years, under the guidance and dictatorship of\r\nCircumstance, and finally arrived in a city of Iowa, where I worked\r\nseveral months. Among the books that interested me in those days was one\r\nabout the Amazon. The traveler told an alluring tale of his long voyage\r\nup the great river from Para to the sources of the Madeira, through the\r\nheart of an enchanted land, a land wastefully rich in tropical wonders,\r\na romantic land where all the birds and flowers and animals were of\r\nthe museum varieties, and where the alligator and the crocodile and the\r\nmonkey seemed as much at home as if they were in the Zoo. Also, he\r\ntold an astonishing tale about COCA, a vegetable product of miraculous\r\npowers, asserting that it was so nourishing and so strength-giving that\r\nthe native of the mountains of the Madeira region would tramp up hill\r\nand down all day on a pinch of powdered coca and require no other\r\nsustenance.\r\n\r\nI was fired with a longing to ascend the Amazon. Also with a longing to\r\nopen up a trade in coca with all the world. During months I dreamed\r\nthat dream, and tried to contrive ways to get to Para and spring that\r\nsplendid enterprise upon an unsuspecting planet. But all in vain. A\r\nperson may PLAN as much as he wants to, but nothing of consequence is\r\nlikely to come of it until the magician CIRCUMSTANCE steps in and takes\r\nthe matter off his hands. At last Circumstance came to my help. It was\r\nin this way. Circumstance, to help or hurt another man, made him lose\r\na fifty-dollar bill in the street; and to help or hurt me, made me find\r\nit. I advertised the find, and left for the Amazon the same day. This\r\nwas another turning-point, another link.\r\n\r\nCould Circumstance have ordered another dweller in that town to go to\r\nthe Amazon and open up a world-trade in coca on a fifty-dollar basis\r\nand been obeyed? No, I was the only one. There were other fools\r\nthere--shoals and shoals of them--but they were not of my kind. I was\r\nthe only one of my kind.\r\n\r\nCircumstance is powerful, but it cannot work alone; it has to have a\r\npartner. Its partner is man's TEMPERAMENT--his natural disposition.\r\nHis temperament is not his invention, it is BORN in him, and he has no\r\nauthority over it, neither is he responsible for its acts. He cannot\r\nchange it, nothing can change it, nothing can modify it--except\r\ntemporarily. But it won't stay modified. It is permanent, like the\r\ncolor of the man's eyes and the shape of his ears. Blue eyes are gray\r\nin certain unusual lights; but they resume their natural color when that\r\nstress is removed.\r\n\r\nA Circumstance that will coerce one man will have no effect upon a man\r\nof a different temperament. If Circumstance had thrown the bank-note\r\nin Caesar's way, his temperament would not have made him start for the\r\nAmazon. His temperament would have compelled him to do something with\r\nthe money, but not that. It might have made him advertise the note--and\r\nWAIT. We can't tell. Also, it might have made him go to New York and\r\nbuy into the Government, with results that would leave Tweed nothing to\r\nlearn when it came his turn.\r\n\r\nVery well, Circumstance furnished the capital, and my temperament told\r\nme what to do with it. Sometimes a temperament is an ass. When that is\r\nthe case the owner of it is an ass, too, and is going to remain\r\none. Training, experience, association, can temporarily so polish him,\r\nimprove him, exalt him that people will think he is a mule, but they\r\nwill be mistaken. Artificially he IS a mule, for the time being, but at\r\nbottom he is an ass yet, and will remain one.\r\n\r\nBy temperament I was the kind of person that DOES things. Does them, and\r\nreflects afterward. So I started for the Amazon without reflecting and\r\nwithout asking any questions. That was more than fifty years ago. In all\r\nthat time my temperament has not changed, by even a shade. I have\r\nbeen punished many and many a time, and bitterly, for doing things and\r\nreflecting afterward, but these tortures have been of no value to me;\r\nI still do the thing commanded by Circumstance and Temperament, and\r\nreflect afterward. Always violently. When I am reflecting, on those\r\noccasions, even deaf persons can hear me think.\r\n\r\nI went by the way of Cincinnati, and down the Ohio and Mississippi.\r\nMy idea was to take ship, at New Orleans, for Para. In New Orleans I\r\ninquired, and found there was no ship leaving for Para. Also, that there\r\nnever had BEEN one leaving for Para. I reflected. A policeman came and\r\nasked me what I was doing, and I told him. He made me move on, and said\r\nif he caught me reflecting in the public street again he would run me\r\nin.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days I was out of money. Then Circumstance arrived, with\r\nanother turning-point of my life--a new link. On my way down, I had made\r\nthe acquaintance of a pilot. I begged him to teach me the river, and he\r\nconsented. I became a pilot.\r\n\r\nBy and by Circumstance came again--introducing the Civil War, this\r\ntime, in order to push me ahead another stage or two toward the literary\r\nprofession. The boats stopped running, my livelihood was gone.\r\n\r\nCircumstance came to the rescue with a new turning-point and a fresh\r\nlink. My brother was appointed secretary to the new Territory of Nevada,\r\nand he invited me to go with him and help him in his office. I accepted.\r\n\r\nIn Nevada, Circumstance furnished me the silver fever and I went into\r\nthe mines to make a fortune, as I supposed; but that was not the idea.\r\nThe idea was to advance me another step toward literature. For amusement\r\nI scribbled things for the Virginia City ENTERPRISE. One isn't a printer\r\nten years without setting up acres of good and bad literature, and\r\nlearning--unconsciously at first, consciously later--to discriminate\r\nbetween the two, within his mental limitations; and meantime he is\r\nunconsciously acquiring what is called a \"style.\" One of my efforts\r\nattracted attention, and the ENTERPRISE sent for me and put me on its\r\nstaff.\r\n\r\nAnd so I became a journalist--another link. By and by Circumstance and\r\nthe Sacramento UNION sent me to the Sandwich Islands for five or\r\nsix months, to write up sugar. I did it; and threw in a good deal of\r\nextraneous matter that hadn't anything to do with sugar. But it was this\r\nextraneous matter that helped me to another link.\r\n\r\nIt made me notorious, and San Francisco invited me to lecture. Which\r\nI did. And profitably. I had long had a desire to travel and see the\r\nworld, and now Circumstance had most kindly and unexpectedly hurled me\r\nupon the platform and furnished me the means. So I joined the \"Quaker\r\nCity Excursion.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to America, Circumstance was waiting on the pier--with\r\nthe LAST link--the conspicuous, the consummating, the victorious link:\r\nI was asked to WRITE A BOOK, and I did it, and called it THE INNOCENTS\r\nABROAD. Thus I became at last a member of the literary guild. That was\r\nforty-two years ago, and I have been a member ever since. Leaving the\r\nRubicon incident away back where it belongs, I can say with truth that\r\nthe reason I am in the literary profession is because I had the measles\r\nwhen I was twelve years old.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nNow what interests me, as regards these details, is not the details\r\nthemselves, but the fact that none of them was foreseen by me, none of\r\nthem was planned by me, I was the author of none of them. Circumstance,\r\nworking in harness with my temperament, created them all and compelled\r\nthem all. I often offered help, and with the best intentions, but it was\r\nrejected--as a rule, uncourteously. I could never plan a thing and get\r\nit to come out the way I planned it. It came out some other way--some\r\nway I had not counted upon.\r\n\r\nAnd so I do not admire the human being--as an intellectual marvel--as\r\nmuch as I did when I was young, and got him out of books, and did not\r\nknow him personally. When I used to read that such and such a general\r\ndid a certain brilliant thing, I believed it. Whereas it was not so.\r\nCircumstance did it by help of his temperament. The circumstance would\r\nhave failed of effect with a general of another temperament: he might\r\nsee the chance, but lose the advantage by being by nature too slow or\r\ntoo quick or too doubtful. Once General Grant was asked a question about\r\na matter which had been much debated by the public and the newspapers;\r\nhe answered the question without any hesitancy. \"General, who planned\r\nthe march through Georgia?\" \"The enemy!\" He added that the enemy\r\nusually makes your plans for you. He meant that the enemy by neglect or\r\nthrough force of circumstances leaves an opening for you, and you see\r\nyour chance and take advantage of it.\r\n\r\nCircumstances do the planning for us all, no doubt, by help of our\r\ntemperaments. I see no great difference between a man and a watch,\r\nexcept that the man is conscious and the watch isn't, and the man TRIES\r\nto plan things and the watch doesn't. The watch doesn't wind itself\r\nand doesn't regulate itself--these things are done exteriorly. Outside\r\ninfluences, outside circumstances, wind the MAN and regulate him. Left\r\nto himself, he wouldn't get regulated at all, and the sort of time he\r\nwould keep would not be valuable. Some rare men are wonderful watches,\r\nwith gold case, compensation balance, and all those things, and some\r\nmen are only simple and sweet and humble Waterburys. I am a Waterbury. A\r\nWaterbury of that kind, some say.\r\n\r\nA nation is only an individual multiplied. It makes plans and\r\nCircumstance comes and upsets them--or enlarges them. Some patriots\r\nthrow the tea overboard; some other patriots destroy a Bastille. The\r\nPLANS stop there; then Circumstance comes in, quite unexpectedly, and\r\nturns these modest riots into a revolution.\r\n\r\nAnd there was poor Columbus. He elaborated a deep plan to find a new\r\nroute to an old country. Circumstance revised his plan for him, and he\r\nfound a new WORLD. And HE gets the credit of it to this day. He hadn't\r\nanything to do with it.\r\n\r\nNecessarily the scene of the real turning-point of my life (and of\r\nyours) was the Garden of Eden. It was there that the first link was\r\nforged of the chain that was ultimately to lead to the emptying of me\r\ninto the literary guild. Adam's TEMPERAMENT was the first command the\r\nDeity ever issued to a human being on this planet. And it was the only\r\ncommand Adam would NEVER be able to disobey. It said, \"Be weak, be\r\nwater, be characterless, be cheaply persuadable.\" The latter command, to\r\nlet the fruit alone, was certain to be disobeyed. Not by Adam himself,\r\nbut by his TEMPERAMENT--which he did not create and had no authority\r\nover. For the TEMPERAMENT is the man; the thing tricked out with clothes\r\nand named Man is merely its Shadow, nothing more. The law of the tiger's\r\ntemperament is, Thou shalt kill; the law of the sheep's temperament is\r\nThou shalt not kill. To issue later commands requiring the tiger to let\r\nthe fat stranger alone, and requiring the sheep to imbue its hands in\r\nthe blood of the lion is not worth while, for those commands CAN'T be\r\nobeyed. They would invite to violations of the law of TEMPERAMENT, which\r\nis supreme, and takes precedence of all other authorities. I cannot help\r\nfeeling disappointed in Adam and Eve. That is, in their temperaments.\r\nNot in THEM, poor helpless young creatures--afflicted with temperaments\r\nmade out of butter; which butter was commanded to get into contact with\r\nfire and BE MELTED. What I cannot help wishing is, that Adam and EVE had been\r\npostponed, and Martin Luther and Joan of Arc put in their place--that\r\nsplendid pair equipped with temperaments not made of butter, but of\r\nasbestos. By neither sugary persuasions nor by hell fire could Satan\r\nhave beguiled THEM to eat the apple. There would have been results!\r\nIndeed, yes. The apple would be intact today; there would be no human\r\nrace; there would be no YOU; there would be no ME. And the old, old\r\ncreation-dawn scheme of ultimately launching me into the literary guild\r\nwould have been defeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE HISTORY DATES STICK\r\n\r\nThese chapters are for children, and I shall try to make the words large\r\nenough to command respect. In the hope that you are listening, and that\r\nyou have confidence in me, I will proceed. Dates are difficult things to\r\nacquire; and after they are acquired it is difficult to keep them in\r\nthe head. But they are very valuable. They are like the cattle-pens of a\r\nranch--they shut in the several brands of historical cattle, each within\r\nits own fence, and keep them from getting mixed together. Dates are hard\r\nto remember because they consist of figures; figures are monotonously\r\nunstriking in appearance, and they don't take hold, they form no\r\npictures, and so they give the eye no chance to help. Pictures are the\r\nthing. Pictures can make dates stick. They can make nearly anything\r\nstick--particularly IF YOU MAKE THE PICTURES YOURSELF. Indeed, that\r\nis the great point--make the pictures YOURSELF. I know about this from\r\nexperience. Thirty years ago I was delivering a memorized lecture every\r\nnight, and every night I had to help myself with a page of notes to\r\nkeep from getting myself mixed. The notes consisted of beginnings of\r\nsentences, and were eleven in number, and they ran something like this:\r\n\r\n\"IN THAT REGION THE WEATHER--\"\r\n\r\n\"AT THAT TIME IT WAS A CUSTOM--\"\r\n\r\n\"BUT IN CALIFORNIA ONE NEVER HEARD--\"\r\n\r\nEleven of them. They initialed the brief divisions of the lecture and\r\nprotected me against skipping. But they all looked about alike on the\r\npage; they formed no picture; I had them by heart, but I could never\r\nwith certainty remember the order of their succession; therefore I\r\nalways had to keep those notes by me and look at them every little\r\nwhile. Once I mislaid them; you will not be able to imagine the terrors\r\nof that evening. I now saw that I must invent some other protection. So\r\nI got ten of the initial letters by heart in their proper order--I,\r\nA, B, and so on--and I went on the platform the next night with these\r\nmarked in ink on my ten finger-nails. But it didn't answer. I kept track\r\nof the fingers for a while; then I lost it, and after that I was never\r\nquite sure which finger I had used last. I couldn't lick off a letter\r\nafter using it, for while they would have made success certain it would\r\nalso have provoked too much curiosity. There was curiosity enough\r\nwithout that. To the audience I seemed more interested in my fingernails\r\nthan I was in my subject; one or two persons asked me afterward what was\r\nthe matter with my hands.\r\n\r\nIt was now that the idea of pictures occurred to me; then my troubles\r\npassed away. In two minutes I made six pictures with a pen, and they did\r\nthe work of the eleven catch-sentences, and did it perfectly. I threw\r\nthe pictures away as soon as they were made, for I was sure I could shut\r\nmy eyes and see them any time. That was a quarter of a century ago; the\r\nlecture vanished out of my head more than twenty years ago, but I could\r\nrewrite it from the pictures--for they remain. Here are three of them:\r\n(Fig. 1).\r\n\r\nThe first one is a haystack--below it a rattlesnake--and it told me\r\nwhere to begin to talk ranch-life in Carson Valley. The second one told\r\nme where to begin the talk about a strange and violent wind that used\r\nto burst upon Carson City from the Sierra Nevadas every afternoon at two\r\no'clock and try to blow the town away. The third picture, as you easily\r\nperceive, is lightning; its duty was to remind me when it was time\r\nto begin to talk about San Francisco weather, where there IS no\r\nlightning--nor thunder, either--and it never failed me.\r\n\r\nI will give you a valuable hint. When a man is making a speech and you\r\nare to follow him don't jot down notes to speak from, jot down PICTURES.\r\nIt is awkward and embarrassing to have to keep referring to notes; and\r\nbesides it breaks up your speech and makes it ragged and non-coherent;\r\nbut you can tear up your pictures as soon as you have made them--they\r\nwill stay fresh and strong in your memory in the order and sequence in\r\nwhich you scratched them down. And many will admire to see what a good\r\nmemory you are furnished with, when perhaps your memory is not any\r\nbetter than mine.\r\n\r\nSixteen years ago when my children were little creatures the governess\r\nwas trying to hammer some primer histories into their heads. Part of\r\nthis fun--if you like to call it that--consisted in the memorizing of\r\nthe accession dates of the thirty-seven personages who had ruled over England\r\nfrom the Conqueror down. These little people found it a bitter, hard\r\ncontract. It was all dates, they all looked alike, and they wouldn't\r\nstick. Day after day of the summer vacation dribbled by, and still the\r\nkings held the fort; the children couldn't conquer any six of them.\r\n\r\nWith my lecture experience in mind I was aware that I could invent some\r\nway out of the trouble with pictures, but I hoped a way could be found\r\nwhich would let them romp in the open air while they learned the kings.\r\nI found it, and then they mastered all the monarchs in a day or two.\r\n\r\nThe idea was to make them SEE the reigns with their eyes; that would be\r\na large help. We were at the farm then. From the house-porch the grounds\r\nsloped gradually down to the lower fence and rose on the right to the\r\nhigh ground where my small work-den stood. A carriage-road wound through\r\nthe grounds and up the hill. I staked it out with the English monarchs,\r\nbeginning with the Conqueror, and you could stand on the porch and\r\nclearly see every reign and its length, from the Conquest down to\r\nVictoria, then in the forty-sixth year of her reign--EIGHT HUNDRED AND\r\nSEVENTEEN YEARS OF English history under your eye at once!\r\n\r\nEnglish history was an unusually live topic in America just then. The\r\nworld had suddenly realized that while it was not noticing the Queen\r\nhad passed Henry VIII., passed Henry VI. and Elizabeth, and gaining\r\nin length every day. Her reign had entered the list of the long ones;\r\neverybody was interested now--it was watching a race. Would she pass\r\nthe long Edward? There was a possibility of it. Would she pass the\r\nlong Henry? Doubtful, most people said. The long George? Impossible!\r\nEverybody said it. But we have lived to see her leave him two years\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nI measured off 817 feet of the roadway, a foot representing a year, and\r\nat the beginning and end of each reign I drove a three-foot white-pine\r\nstake in the turf by the roadside and wrote the name and dates on it.\r\nAbreast the middle of the porch-front stood a great granite flower-vase\r\noverflowing with a cataract of bright-yellow flowers--I can't think of\r\ntheir name. The vase was William the Conqueror. We put his name on it\r\nand his accession date, 1066. We started from that and measured off\r\ntwenty-one feet of the road, and drove William Rufus's stake; then\r\nthirteen feet and drove the first Henry's stake; then thirty-five feet\r\nand drove Stephen's; then nineteen feet, which brought us just past\r\nthe summer-house on the left; then we staked out thirty-five, ten, and\r\nseventeen for the second Henry and Richard and John; turned the curve\r\nand entered upon just what was needed for Henry III.--a level, straight\r\nstretch of fifty-six feet of road without a crinkle in it. And it lay\r\nexactly in front of the house, in the middle of the grounds. There\r\ncouldn't have been a better place for that long reign; you could stand\r\non the porch and see those two wide-apart stakes almost with your eyes\r\nshut. (Fig. 2.)\r\n\r\nThat isn't the shape of the road--I have bunched it up like that to save\r\nroom. The road had some great curves in it, but their gradual sweep was\r\nsuch that they were no mar to history. No, in our road one could tell\r\nat a glance who was who by the size of the vacancy between stakes--with\r\nLOCALITY to help, of course.\r\n\r\nAlthough I am away off here in a Swedish village (1) and those stakes\r\ndid not stand till the snow came, I can see them today as plainly as\r\never; and whenever I think of an English monarch his stakes rise before\r\nme of their own accord and I notice the large or small space which he\r\ntakes up on our road. Are your kings spaced off in your mind? When you\r\nthink of Richard III. and of James II. do the durations of their reigns\r\nseem about alike to you? It isn't so to me; I always notice that there's\r\na foot's difference. When you think of Henry III. do you see a great\r\nlong stretch of straight road? I do; and just at the end where it joins\r\non to Edward I. I always see a small pear-bush with its green fruit\r\nhanging down. When I think of the Commonwealth I see a shady little\r\ngroup of these small saplings which we called the oak parlor; when\r\nI think of George III. I see him stretching up the hill, part of him\r\noccupied by a flight of stone steps; and I can locate Stephen to an inch\r\nwhen he comes into my mind, for he just filled the stretch which went\r\nby the summer-house. Victoria's reign reached almost to my study door on\r\nthe first little summit; there's sixteen feet to be added now; I believe\r\nthat that would carry it to a big pine-tree that was shattered by some\r\nlightning one summer when it was trying to hit me.\r\n\r\nWe got a good deal of fun out of the history road; and exercise, too. We\r\ntrotted the course from the conqueror to the study, the children calling\r\nout the names, dates, and length of reigns as we passed the stakes,\r\ngoing a good gait along the long reigns, but slowing down when we\r\ncame upon people like Mary and Edward VI., and the short Stuart and\r\nPlantagenet, to give time to get in the statistics. I offered prizes,\r\ntoo--apples. I threw one as far as I could send it, and the child that\r\nfirst shouted the reign it fell in got the apple.\r\n\r\nThe children were encouraged to stop locating things as being \"over by\r\nthe arbor,\" or \"in the oak parlor,\" or \"up at the stone steps,\" and say\r\ninstead that the things were in Stephen, or in the Commonwealth, or in\r\nGeorge III. They got the habit without trouble. To have the long road\r\nmapped out with such exactness was a great boon for me, for I had the\r\nhabit of leaving books and other articles lying around everywhere, and\r\nhad not previously been able to definitely name the place, and so had\r\noften been obliged to go to fetch them myself, to save time and failure;\r\nbut now I could name the reign I left them in, and send the children.\r\n\r\nNext I thought I would measure off the French reigns, and peg them\r\nalongside the English ones, so that we could always have contemporaneous\r\nFrench history under our eyes as we went our English rounds. We pegged\r\nthem down to the Hundred Years' War, then threw the idea aside, I do not\r\nnow remember why. After that we made the English pegs fence in European\r\nand American history as well as English, and that answered very well.\r\nEnglish and alien poets, statesmen, artists, heroes, battles, plagues,\r\ncataclysms, revolutions--we shoveled them all into the English fences\r\naccording to their dates. Do you understand? We gave Washington's birth\r\nto George II.'s pegs and his death to George III.'s; George II. got\r\nthe Lisbon earthquake and George III. the Declaration of Independence.\r\nGoethe, Shakespeare, Napoleon, Savonarola, Joan of Arc, the French\r\nRevolution, the Edict of Nantes, Clive, Wellington, Waterloo, Plassey,\r\nPatay, Cowpens, Saratoga, the Battle of the Boyne, the invention of the\r\nlogarithms, the microscope, the steam-engine, the telegraph--anything\r\nand everything all over the world--we dumped it all in among the English\r\npegs according to its date and regardless of its nationality.\r\n\r\nIf the road-pegging scheme had not succeeded I should have lodged the\r\nkings in the children's heads by means of pictures--that is, I should\r\nhave tried. It might have failed, for the pictures could only be\r\neffective WHEN MADE BY THE PUPIL; not the master, for it is the work\r\nput upon the drawing that makes the drawing stay in the memory, and my\r\nchildren were too little to make drawings at that time. And, besides,\r\nthey had no talent for art, which is strange, for in other ways they are\r\nlike me.\r\n\r\nBut I will develop the picture plan now, hoping that you will be able\r\nto use it. It will come good for indoors when the weather is bad and one\r\ncannot go outside and peg a road. Let us imagine that the kings are a\r\nprocession, and that they have come out of the Ark and down Ararat for\r\nexercise and are now starting back again up the zigzag road. This will\r\nbring several of them into view at once, and each zigzag will represent\r\nthe length of a king's reign.\r\n\r\nAnd so on. You will have plenty of space, for by my project you will use\r\nthe parlor wall. You do not mark on the wall; that would cause trouble.\r\nYou only attach bits of paper to it with pins or thumb-tacks. These will\r\nleave no mark.\r\n\r\nTake your pen now, and twenty-one pieces of white paper, each two inches\r\nsquare, and we will do the twenty-one years of the Conqueror's reign.\r\nOn each square draw a picture of a whale and write the dates and term of\r\nservice. We choose the whale for several reasons: its name and William's\r\nbegin with the same letter; it is the biggest fish that swims, and\r\nWilliam is the most conspicuous figure in English history in the way of\r\na landmark; finally, a whale is about the easiest thing to draw. By\r\nthe time you have drawn twenty-one wales and written \"William\r\nI.--1066-1087--twenty-one years\" twenty-one times, those details will be\r\nyour property; you cannot dislodge them from your memory with anything\r\nbut dynamite. I will make a sample for you to copy: (Fig. 3).\r\n\r\nI have got his chin up too high, but that is no matter; he is looking\r\nfor Harold. It may be that a whale hasn't that fin up there on his back,\r\nbut I do not remember; and so, since there is a doubt, it is best to err\r\non the safe side. He looks better, anyway, than he would without it.\r\n\r\nBe very careful and ATTENTIVE while you are drawing your first whale\r\nfrom my sample and writing the word and figures under it, so that you\r\nwill not need to copy the sample any more. Compare your copy with the\r\nsample; examine closely; if you find you have got everything right and\r\ncan shut your eyes and see the picture and call the words and figures,\r\nthen turn the sample and copy upside down and make the next copy from\r\nmemory; and also the next and next, and so on, always drawing and\r\nwriting from memory until you have finished the whole twenty-one. This\r\nwill take you twenty minutes, or thirty, and by that time you will find\r\nthat you can make a whale in less time than an unpracticed person can\r\nmake a sardine; also, up to the time you die you will always be able to\r\nfurnish William's dates to any ignorant person that inquires after them.\r\n\r\nYou will now take thirteen pieces of BLUE paper, each two inches square,\r\nand do William II. (Fig. 4.)\r\n\r\nMake him spout his water forward instead of backward; also make him\r\nsmall, and stick a harpoon in him and give him that sick look in the\r\neye. Otherwise you might seem to be continuing the other William, and\r\nthat would be confusing and a damage. It is quite right to make him\r\nsmall; he was only about a No. 11 whale, or along there somewhere;\r\nthere wasn't room in him for his father's great spirit. The barb of that\r\nharpoon ought not to show like that, because it is down inside the whale\r\nand ought to be out of sight, but it cannot be helped; if the barb were\r\nremoved people would think some one had stuck a whip-stock into the\r\nwhale. It is best to leave the barb the way it is, then every one will\r\nknow it is a harpoon and attending to business. Remember--draw from the\r\ncopy only once; make your other twelve and the inscription from memory.\r\n\r\nNow the truth is that whenever you have copied a picture and its\r\ninscription once from my sample and two or three times from memory the\r\ndetails will stay with you and be hard to forget. After that, if you\r\nlike, you may make merely the whale's HEAD and WATER-SPOUT for the\r\nConqueror till you end his reign, each time SAYING the inscription in\r\nplace of writing it; and in the case of William II. make the HARPOON\r\nalone, and say over the inscription each time you do it. You see, it\r\nwill take nearly twice as long to do the first set as it will to do\r\nthe second, and that will give you a marked sense of the difference in\r\nlength of the two reigns.\r\n\r\nNext do Henry I. on thirty-five squares of RED paper. (Fig. 5.)\r\n\r\nThat is a hen, and suggests Henry by furnishing the first syllable. When\r\nyou have repeated the hen and the inscription until you are perfectly\r\nsure of them, draw merely the hen's head the rest of the thirty-five\r\ntimes, saying over the inscription each time. Thus: (Fig. 6).\r\n\r\nYou begin to understand now how this procession is going to look when\r\nit is on the wall. First there will be the Conqueror's twenty-one whales\r\nand water-spouts, the twenty-one white squares joined to one another and\r\nmaking a white stripe three and one-half feet long; the thirteen blue\r\nsquares of William II. will be joined to that--a blue stripe two feet,\r\ntwo inches long, followed by Henry's red stripe five feet, ten inches\r\nlong, and so on. The colored divisions will smartly show to the eye the\r\ndifference in the length of the reigns and impress the proportions on\r\nthe memory and the understanding. (Fig. 7.)\r\n\r\nStephen of Blois comes next. He requires nineteen two-inch squares of\r\nYELLOW paper. (Fig. 8.)\r\n\r\nThat is a steer. The sound suggests the beginning of Stephen's name. I\r\nchoose it for that reason. I can make a better steer than that when I\r\nam not excited. But this one will do. It is a good-enough steer for\r\nhistory. The tail is defective, but it only wants straightening out.\r\n\r\nNext comes Henry II. Give him thirty-five squares of RED paper. These\r\nhens must face west, like the former ones. (Fig. 9.)\r\n\r\nThis hen differs from the other one. He is on his way to inquire what\r\nhas been happening in Canterbury.\r\n\r\nNow we arrive at Richard I., called Richard of the Lion-heart because\r\nhe was a brave fighter and was never so contented as when he was leading\r\ncrusades in Palestine and neglecting his affairs at home. Give him ten\r\nsquares of WHITE paper. (Fig. 10).\r\n\r\nThat is a lion. His office is to remind you of the lion-hearted Richard.\r\nThere is something the matter with his legs, but I do not quite know\r\nwhat it is, they do not seem right. I think the hind ones are the most\r\nunsatisfactory; the front ones are well enough, though it would be\r\nbetter if they were rights and lefts.\r\n\r\nNext comes King John, and he was a poor circumstance. He was called\r\nLackland. He gave his realm to the Pope. Let him have seventeen squares\r\nof YELLOW paper. (Fig. 11.)\r\n\r\nThat creature is a jamboree. It looks like a trademark, but that is only\r\nan accident and not intentional. It is prehistoric and extinct. It used\r\nto roam the earth in the Old Silurian times, and lay eggs and catch fish\r\nand climb trees and live on fossils; for it was of a mixed breed, which\r\nwas the fashion then. It was very fierce, and the Old Silurians\r\nwere afraid of it, but this is a tame one. Physically it has no\r\nrepresentative now, but its mind has been transmitted. First I drew it\r\nsitting down, but have turned it the other way now because I think it\r\nlooks more attractive and spirited when one end of it is galloping. I\r\nlove to think that in this attitude it gives us a pleasant idea of\r\nJohn coming all in a happy excitement to see what the barons have been\r\narranging for him at Runnymede, while the other one gives us an idea of\r\nhim sitting down to wring his hands and grieve over it.\r\n\r\nWe now come to Henry III.; RED squares again, of course--fifty-six of\r\nthem. We must make all the Henrys the same color; it will make their\r\nlong reigns show up handsomely on the wall. Among all the eight Henrys\r\nthere were but two short ones. A lucky name, as far as longevity goes.\r\nThe reigns of six of the Henrys cover 227 years. It might have been well\r\nto name all the royal princes Henry, but this was overlooked until it\r\nwas too late. (Fig. 12.)\r\n\r\nThis is the best one yet. He is on his way (1265) to have a look at the\r\nfirst House of Commons in English history. It was a monumental event,\r\nthe situation of the House, and was the second great liberty landmark\r\nwhich the century had set up. I have made Henry looking glad, but this\r\nwas not intentional.\r\n\r\nEdward I. comes next; LIGHT-BROWN paper, thirty-five squares. (Fig. 13.)\r\n\r\nThat is an editor. He is trying to think of a word. He props his feet on\r\nthe chair, which is the editor's way; then he can think better. I do not\r\ncare much for this one; his ears are not alike; still, editor suggests\r\nthe sound of Edward, and he will do. I could make him better if I had\r\na model, but I made this one from memory. But it is no particular matter;\r\nthey all look alike, anyway. They are conceited and troublesome, and\r\ndon't pay enough. Edward was the first really English king that had yet\r\noccupied the throne. The editor in the picture probably looks just as\r\nEdward looked when it was first borne in upon him that this was so. His\r\nwhole attitude expressed gratification and pride mixed with stupefaction\r\nand astonishment.\r\n\r\nEdward II. now; twenty BLUE squares. (Fig. 14.)\r\n\r\nAnother editor. That thing behind his ear is his pencil. Whenever he\r\nfinds a bright thing in your manuscript he strikes it out with that.\r\nThat does him good, and makes him smile and show his teeth, the way he\r\nis doing in the picture. This one has just been striking out a smart\r\nthing, and now he is sitting there with his thumbs in his vest-holes,\r\ngloating. They are full of envy and malice, editors are. This picture\r\nwill serve to remind you that Edward II. was the first English king who\r\nwas DEPOSED. Upon demand, he signed his deposition himself. He had found\r\nkingship a most aggravating and disagreeable occupation, and you can\r\nsee by the look of him that he is glad he resigned. He has put his blue\r\npencil up for good now. He had struck out many a good thing with it in\r\nhis time.\r\n\r\nEdward III. next; fifty RED squares. (Fig. 15.)\r\n\r\nThis editor is a critic. He has pulled out his carving-knife and his\r\ntomahawk and is starting after a book which he is going to have for\r\nbreakfast. This one's arms are put on wrong. I did not notice it at\r\nfirst, but I see it now. Somehow he has got his right arm on his left\r\nshoulder, and his left arm on the right shoulder, and this shows us\r\nthe back of his hands in both instances. It makes him left-handed all\r\naround, which is a thing which has never happened before, except perhaps\r\nin a museum. That is the way with art, when it is not acquired but born\r\nto you: you start in to make some simple little thing, not suspecting\r\nthat your genius is beginning to work and swell and strain in secret,\r\nand all of a sudden there is a convulsion and you fetch out something\r\nastonishing. This is called inspiration. It is an accident; you never\r\nknow when it is coming. I might have tried as much as a year to think\r\nof such a strange thing as an all-around left-handed man and I could not\r\nhave done it, for the more you try to think of an unthinkable thing the\r\nmore it eludes you; but it can't elude inspiration; you have only\r\nto bait with inspiration and you will get it every time. Look at\r\nBotticelli's \"Spring.\" Those snaky women were unthinkable, but\r\ninspiration secured them for us, thanks to goodness. It is too late to\r\nreorganize this editor-critic now; we will leave him as he is. He will\r\nserve to remind us.\r\n\r\nRichard II. next; twenty-two WHITE squares. (Fig. 16.)\r\n\r\nWe use the lion again because this is another Richard. Like Edward II.,\r\nhe was DEPOSED. He is taking a last sad look at his crown before they\r\ntake it away. There was not room enough and I have made it too small;\r\nbut it never fitted him, anyway.\r\n\r\nNow we turn the corner of the century with a new line of monarchs--the\r\nLancastrian kings.\r\n\r\nHenry IV.; fourteen squares of YELLOW paper. (Fig. 17.)\r\n\r\nThis hen has laid the egg of a new dynasty and realizes the imposing magnitude\r\nof the event. She is giving notice in the usual way. You notice I am\r\nimproving in the construction of hens. At first I made them too\r\nmuch like other animals, but this one is orthodox. I mention this\r\nto encourage you. You will find that the more you practice the more\r\naccurate you will become. I could always draw animals, but before I was\r\neducated I could not tell what kind they were when I got them done, but\r\nnow I can. Keep up your courage; it will be the same with you, although\r\nyou may not think it. This Henry died the year after Joan of Arc was\r\nborn.\r\n\r\nHenry V.; nine BLUE squares. (Fig. 18)\r\n\r\nThere you see him lost in meditation over the monument which records the\r\namazing figures of the battle of Agincourt. French history says 20,000\r\nEnglishmen routed 80,000 Frenchmen there; and English historians say\r\nthat the French loss, in killed and wounded, was 60,000.\r\n\r\nHenry VI.; thirty-nine RED squares. (Fig. 19)\r\n\r\nThis is poor Henry VI., who reigned long and scored many misfortunes and\r\nhumiliations. Also two great disasters: he lost France to Joan of Arc\r\nand he lost the throne and ended the dynasty which Henry IV. had started\r\nin business with such good prospects. In the picture we see him sad and\r\nweary and downcast, with the scepter falling from his nerveless grasp.\r\nIt is a pathetic quenching of a sun which had risen in such splendor.\r\n\r\nEdward IV.; twenty-two LIGHT-BROWN squares. (Fig. 20.)\r\n\r\nThat is a society editor, sitting there elegantly dressed, with his legs\r\ncrossed in that indolent way, observing the clothes the ladies wear,\r\nso that he can describe them for his paper and make them out finer than\r\nthey are and get bribes for it and become wealthy. That flower which he\r\nis wearing in his buttonhole is a rose--a white rose, a York rose--and\r\nwill serve to remind us of the War of the Roses, and that the white one\r\nwas the winning color when Edward got the throne and dispossessed the\r\nLancastrian dynasty.\r\n\r\nEdward V.; one-third of a BLACK square. (Fig. 21.)\r\n\r\nHis uncle Richard had him murdered in the tower. When you get the\r\nreigns displayed upon the wall this one will be conspicuous and easily\r\nremembered. It is the shortest one in English history except Lady Jane\r\nGrey's, which was only nine days. She is never officially recognized\r\nas a monarch of England, but if you or I should ever occupy a throne we\r\nshould like to have proper notice taken of it; and it would be only fair\r\nand right, too, particularly if we gained nothing by it and lost our\r\nlives besides.\r\n\r\nRichard III.; two WHITE squares. (Fig. 22.)\r\n\r\nThat is not a very good lion, but Richard was not a very good king. You\r\nwould think that this lion has two heads, but that is not so; one is\r\nonly a shadow. There would be shadows for the rest of him, but there was\r\nnot light enough to go round, it being a dull day, with only fleeting\r\nsun-glimpses now and then. Richard had a humped back and a hard heart,\r\nand fell at the battle of Bosworth. I do not know the name of that\r\nflower in the pot, but we will use it as Richard's trade-mark, for it is\r\nsaid that it grows in only one place in the world--Bosworth Field--and\r\ntradition says it never grew there until Richard's royal blood warmed\r\nits hidden seed to life and made it grow.\r\n\r\nHenry VII.; twenty-four BLUE squares. (Fig. 23.)\r\n\r\nHenry VII. had no liking for wars and turbulence; he preferred peace and\r\nquiet and the general prosperity which such conditions create. He liked\r\nto sit on that kind of eggs on his own private account as well as the\r\nnation's, and hatch them out and count up the result. When he died he\r\nleft his heir 2,000,000 pounds, which was a most unusual fortune for a\r\nking to possess in those days. Columbus's great achievement gave him the\r\ndiscovery-fever, and he sent Sebastian Cabot to the New World to search\r\nout some foreign territory for England. That is Cabot's ship up there\r\nin the corner. This was the first time that England went far abroad to\r\nenlarge her estate--but not the last.\r\n\r\nHenry VIII.; thirty-eight RED squares. (Fig. 24.)\r\n\r\nThat is Henry VIII. suppressing a monastery in his arrogant fashion.\r\n\r\nEdward VI.; six squares of YELLOW paper. (Fig. 25.)\r\n\r\nHe is the last Edward to date. It is indicated by that thing over his\r\nhead, which is a LAST--shoemaker's last.\r\n\r\nMary; five squares of BLACK paper. (Fig. 26.)\r\n\r\nThe picture represents a burning martyr. He is in back of the smoke.\r\nThe first three letters of Mary's name and the first three of the word\r\nmartyr are the same. Martyrdom was going out in her day and martyrs were\r\nbecoming scarcer, but she made several. For this reason she is sometimes\r\ncalled Bloody Mary.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the reign of Elizabeth, after passing through a period\r\nof nearly five hundred years of England's history--492 to be exact. I\r\nthink you may now be trusted to go the rest of the way without further\r\nlessons in art or inspirations in the matter of ideas. You have the\r\nscheme now, and something in the ruler's name or career will suggest the\r\npictorial symbol. The effort of inventing such things will not only help\r\nyour memory, but will develop originality in art. See what it has\r\ndone for me. If you do not find the parlor wall big enough for all\r\nof England's history, continue it into the dining-room and into other\r\nrooms. This will make the walls interesting and instructive and really\r\nworth something instead of being just flat things to hold the house\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n     1.  Summer of 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEMORABLE ASSASSINATION\r\n\r\nNote.--The assassination of the Empress of Austria at Geneva, September\r\n10, 1898, occurred during Mark Twain's Austrian residence. The news came\r\nto him at Kaltenleutgeben, a summer resort a little way out of Vienna.\r\nTo his friend, the Rev. Jos. H. Twichell, he wrote:\r\n\r\n\"That good and unoffending lady, the Empress, is killed by a madman,\r\nand I am living in the midst of world-history again. The Queen's Jubilee\r\nlast year, the invasion of the Reichsrath by the police, and now this\r\nmurder, which will still be talked of and described and painted a\r\nthousand years from now. To have a personal friend of the\r\nwearer of two crowns burst in at the gate in the deep dusk of the\r\nevening and say, in a voice broken with tears, 'My God! the Empress is\r\nmurdered,' and fly toward her home before we can utter a question--why,\r\nit brings the giant event home to you, makes you a part of it and\r\npersonally interested; it is as if your neighbor, Antony, should come\r\nflying and say, 'Caesar is butchered--the head of the world is fallen!'\r\n\r\n\"Of course there is no talk but of this. The mourning is universal and\r\ngenuine, the consternation is stupefying. The Austrian Empire is being\r\ndraped with black. Vienna will be a spectacle to see by next Saturday,\r\nwhen the funeral cortege marches.\"\r\n\r\nHe was strongly moved by the tragedy, impelled to write concerning\r\nit. He prepared the article which here follows, but did not offer it for\r\npublication, perhaps feeling that his own close association with the\r\ncourt circles at the moment prohibited this personal utterance. There\r\nappears no such reason for withholding its publication now.\r\n\r\nA. B. P.\r\n\r\nThe more one thinks of the assassination, the more imposing and\r\ntremendous the event becomes. The destruction of a city is a large\r\nevent, but it is one which repeats itself several times in a thousand\r\nyears; the destruction of a third part of a nation by plague and famine\r\nis a large event, but it has happened several times in history; the\r\nmurder of a king is a large event, but it has been frequent.\r\n\r\nThe murder of an empress is the largest of all large events. One must go back\r\nabout two thousand years to find an instance to put with this one. The\r\noldest family of unchallenged descent in Christendom lives in Rome and\r\ntraces its line back seventeen hundred years, but no member of it has\r\nbeen present in the earth when an empress was murdered, until now. Many\r\na time during these seventeen centuries members of that family have\r\nbeen startled with the news of extraordinary events--the destruction\r\nof cities, the fall of thrones, the murder of kings, the wreck of\r\ndynasties, the extinction of religions, the birth of new systems of\r\ngovernment; and their descendants have been by to hear of it and talk\r\nabout it when all these things were repeated once, twice, or a dozen\r\ntimes--but to even that family has come news at last which is not staled\r\nby use, has no duplicates in the long reach of its memory.\r\n\r\nIt is an event which confers a curious distinction upon every individual\r\nnow living in the world: he has stood alive and breathing in the\r\npresence of an event such as has not fallen within the experience of any\r\ntraceable or untraceable ancestor of his for twenty centuries, and it\r\nis not likely to fall within the experience of any descendant of his for\r\ntwenty more.\r\n\r\nTime has made some great changes since the Roman days. The murder of\r\nan empress then--even the assassination of Caesar himself--could not\r\nelectrify the world as this murder has electrified it. For one reason,\r\nthere was then not much of a world to electrify; it was a small world,\r\nas to known bulk, and it had rather a thin population, besides; and for\r\nanother reason, the news traveled so slowly that its tremendous initial\r\nthrill wasted away, week by week and month by month, on the journey, and\r\nby the time it reached the remoter regions there was but little of it\r\nleft. It was no longer a fresh event, it was a thing of the far past;\r\nit was not properly news, it was history. But the world is enormous\r\nnow, and prodigiously populated--that is one change; and another is the\r\nlightning swiftness of the flight of tidings, good and bad. \"The Empress\r\nis murdered!\" When those amazing words struck upon my ear in this\r\nAustrian village last Saturday, three hours after the disaster, I knew\r\nthat it was already old news in London, Paris, Berlin, New York, San\r\nFrancisco, Japan, China, Melbourne, Cape Town, Bombay, Madras,\r\nCalcutta, and that the entire globe with a single voice, was cursing\r\nthe perpetrator of it. Since the telegraph first began to stretch itself\r\nwider and wider about the earth, larger and increasingly larger areas of\r\nthe world have, as time went on, received simultaneously the shock of\r\na great calamity; but this is the first time in history that the entire\r\nsurface of the globe has been swept in a single instant with the thrill\r\nof so gigantic an event.\r\n\r\nAnd who is the miracle-worker who has furnished to the world this\r\nspectacle? All the ironies are compacted in the answer. He is at the\r\nbottom of the human ladder, as the accepted estimates of degree and\r\nvalue go: a soiled and patched young loafer, without gifts, without\r\ntalents, without education, without morals, without character, without\r\nany born charm or any acquired one that wins or beguiles or attracts;\r\nwithout a single grace of mind or heart or hand that any tramp or\r\nprostitute could envy him; an unfaithful private in the ranks, an\r\nincompetent stone-cutter, an inefficient lackey; in a word, a mangy,\r\noffensive, empty, unwashed, vulgar, gross, mephitic, timid, sneaking,\r\nhuman polecat. And it was within the privileges and powers of this\r\nsarcasm upon the human race to reach up--up--up--and strike from its far\r\nsummit in the social skies the world's accepted ideal of Glory and Might\r\nand Splendor and Sacredness! It realizes to us what sorry shows and\r\nshadows we are. Without our clothes and our pedestals we are poor things\r\nand much of a size; our dignities are not real, our pomps are shams. At\r\nour best and stateliest we are not suns, as we pretended, and teach, and\r\nbelieve, but only candles; and any bummer can blow us out.\r\n\r\nAnd now we get realized to us once more another thing which we often\r\nforget--or try to: that no man has a wholly undiseased mind; that in\r\none way or another all men are mad. Many are mad for money. When this\r\nmadness is in a mild form it is harmless and the man passes for sane;\r\nbut when it develops powerfully and takes possession of the man, it can\r\nmake him cheat, rob, and kill; and when he has got his fortune and lost\r\nit again it can land him in the asylum or the suicide's coffin. Love\r\nis a madness; if thwarted it develops fast; it can grow to a frenzy\r\nof despair and make an otherwise sane and highly gifted prince, like\r\nRudolph, throw away the crown of an empire and snuff out his own life.\r\nAll the whole list of desires, predilections, aversions, ambitions,\r\npassions, cares, griefs, regrets, remorses, are incipient madness, and\r\nready to grow, spread, and consume, when the occasion comes. There are\r\nno healthy minds, and nothing saves any man but accident--the accident\r\nof not having his malady put to the supreme test.\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest forms of madness is the desire to be noticed, the\r\npleasure derived from being noticed. Perhaps it is not merely common,\r\nbut universal. In its mildest form it doubtless is universal. Every\r\nchild is pleased at being noticed; many intolerable children put in\r\ntheir whole time in distressing and idiotic effort to attract the\r\nattention of visitors; boys are always \"showing off\"; apparently all\r\nmen and women are glad and grateful when they find that they have done\r\na thing which has lifted them for a moment out of obscurity and caused\r\nwondering talk. This common madness can develop, by nurture, into a\r\nhunger for notoriety in one, for fame in another. It is this madness\r\nfor being noticed and talked about which has invented kingship and the\r\nthousand other dignities, and tricked them out with pretty and showy\r\nfineries; it has made kings pick one another's pockets, scramble for one\r\nanother's crowns and estates, slaughter one another's subjects; it has\r\nraised up prize-fighters, and poets, and village mayors, and little\r\nand big politicians, and big and little charity-founders, and bicycle\r\nchampions, and banditti chiefs, and frontier desperadoes, and Napoleons.\r\nAnything to get notoriety; anything to set the village, or the township,\r\nor the city, or the State, or the nation, or the planet shouting,\r\n\"Look--there he goes--that is the man!\" And in five minutes' time, at no\r\ncost of brain, or labor, or genius this mangy Italian tramp has beaten\r\nthem all, transcended them all, outstripped them all, for in time their\r\nnames will perish; but by the friendly help of the insane newspapers and\r\ncourts and kings and historians, his is safe to live and thunder in the\r\nworld all down the ages as long as human speech shall endure! Oh, if it\r\nwere not so tragic how ludicrous it would be!\r\n\r\nShe was so blameless, the Empress; and so beautiful, in mind and heart,\r\nin person and spirit; and whether with a crown upon her head or without\r\nit and nameless, a grace to the human race, and almost a justification\r\nof its creation; WOULD be, indeed, but that the animal that struck her\r\ndown re-establishes the doubt.\r\n\r\nIn her character was every quality that in woman invites and engages\r\nrespect, esteem, affection, and homage. Her tastes, her instincts, and\r\nher aspirations were all high and fine and all her life her heart and\r\nbrain were busy with activities of a noble sort. She had had bitter\r\ngriefs, but they did not sour her spirit, and she had had the highest\r\nhonors in the world's gift, but she went her simple way unspoiled. She\r\nknew all ranks, and won them all, and made them her friends. An English\r\nfisherman's wife said, \"When a body was in trouble she didn't send\r\nher help, she brought it herself.\" Crowns have adorned others, but she\r\nadorned her crowns.\r\n\r\nIt was a swift celebrity the assassin achieved. And it is marked by some\r\ncurious contrasts. At noon last Saturday there was no one in the\r\nworld who would have considered acquaintanceship with him a thing\r\nworth claiming or mentioning; no one would have been vain of such an\r\nacquaintanceship; the humblest honest boot-black would not have valued\r\nthe fact that he had met him or seen him at some time or other; he was\r\nsunk in abysmal obscurity, he was away beneath the notice of the bottom\r\ngrades of officialdom. Three hours later he was the one subject\r\nof conversation in the world, the gilded generals and admirals and\r\ngovernors were discussing him, all the kings and queens and emperors had\r\nput aside their other interests to talk about him. And wherever there\r\nwas a man, at the summit of the world or the bottom of it, who by chance\r\nhad at some time or other come across that creature, he remembered it\r\nwith a secret satisfaction, and MENTIONED it--for it was a distinction,\r\nnow! It brings human dignity pretty low, and for a moment the thing is\r\nnot quite realizable--but it is perfectly true. If there is a king who\r\ncan remember, now, that he once saw that creature in a time past, he has\r\nlet that fact out, in a more or less studiedly casual and indifferent\r\nway, some dozens of times during the past week. For a king is merely\r\nhuman; the inside of him is exactly like the inside of any other person;\r\nand it is human to find satisfaction in being in a kind of personal\r\nway connected with amazing events. We are all privately vain of such a\r\nthing; we are all alike; a king is a king by accident; the reason the\r\nrest of us are not kings is merely due to another accident; we are all\r\nmade out of the same clay, and it is a sufficiently poor quality.\r\n\r\nBelow the kings, these remarks are in the air these days; I know it as\r\nwell as if I were hearing them:\r\n\r\nTHE COMMANDER: \"He was in my army.\"\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL: \"He was in my corps.\"\r\n\r\nTHE COLONEL: \"He was in my regiment. A brute. I remember him well.\"\r\n\r\nTHE CAPTAIN: \"He was in my company. A troublesome scoundrel. I remember\r\nhim well.\"\r\n\r\nTHE SERGEANT: \"Did I know him? As well as I know you. Why, every morning\r\nI used to--\" etc., etc.; a glad, long story, told to devouring ears.\r\n\r\nTHE LANDLADY: \"Many's the time he boarded with me. I can show you his\r\nvery room, and the very bed he slept in. And the charcoal mark there\r\non the wall--he made that. My little Johnny saw him do it with his own\r\neyes. Didn't you, Johnny?\"\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see, by the papers, that the magistrate and the constables\r\nand the jailer treasure up the assassin's daily remarks and doings\r\nas precious things, and as wallowing this week in seas of blissful\r\ndistinction. The interviewer, too; he tries to let on that he is not\r\nvain of his privilege of contact with this man whom few others are\r\nallowed to gaze upon, but he is human, like the rest, and can no more\r\nkeep his vanity corked in than could you or I.\r\n\r\nSome think that this murder is a frenzied revolt against the criminal\r\nmilitarism which is impoverishing Europe and driving the starving poor\r\nmad. That has many crimes to answer for, but not this one, I think. One\r\nmay not attribute to this man a generous indignation against the wrongs\r\ndone the poor; one may not dignify him with a generous impulse of any\r\nkind. When he saw his photograph and said, \"I shall be celebrated,\"\r\nhe laid bare the impulse that prompted him. It was a mere hunger for\r\nnotoriety. There is another confessed case of the kind which is as old\r\nas history--the burning of the temple of Ephesus.\r\n\r\nAmong the inadequate attempts to account for the assassination we must\r\nconcede high rank to the many which have described it as a \"peculiarly\r\nbrutal crime\" and then added that it was \"ordained from above.\" I think\r\nthis verdict will not be popular \"above.\" If the deed was ordained from\r\nabove, there is no rational way of making this prisoner even partially\r\nresponsible for it, and the Genevan court cannot condemn him without\r\nmanifestly committing a crime. Logic is logic, and by disregarding\r\nits laws even the most pious and showy theologian may be beguiled into\r\npreferring charges which should not be ventured upon except in the\r\nshelter of plenty of lightning-rods.\r\n\r\nI witnessed the funeral procession, in company with friends, from the\r\nwindows of the Krantz, Vienna's sumptuous new hotel. We came into town\r\nin the middle of the forenoon, and I went on foot from the station.\r\nBlack flags hung down from all the houses; the aspects were Sunday-like;\r\nthe crowds on the sidewalks were quiet and moved slowly; very few people\r\nwere smoking; many ladies wore deep mourning, gentlemen were in black\r\nas a rule; carriages were speeding in all directions, with footmen and\r\ncoachmen in black clothes and wearing black cocked hats; the shops were\r\nclosed; in many windows were pictures of the Empress: as a beautiful\r\nyoung bride of seventeen; as a serene and majestic lady with added\r\nyears; and finally in deep black and without ornaments--the costume she\r\nalways wore after the tragic death of her son nine years ago, for her\r\nheart broke then, and life lost almost all its value for her. The people\r\nstood grouped before these pictures, and now and then one saw women and\r\ngirls turn away wiping the tears from their eyes.\r\n\r\nIn front of the Krantz is an open square; over the way was the church\r\nwhere the funeral services would be held. It is small and old and\r\nseverely plain, plastered outside and whitewashed or painted, and with\r\nno ornament but a statue of a monk in a niche over the door, and above\r\nthat a small black flag. But in its crypt lie several of the great dead\r\nof the House of Habsburg, among them Maria Theresa and Napoleon's son,\r\nthe Duke of Reichstadt. Hereabouts was a Roman camp, once, and in it the\r\nEmperor Marcus Aurelius died a thousand years before the first Habsburg\r\nruled in Vienna, which was six hundred years ago and more.\r\n\r\nThe little church is packed in among great modern stores and houses,\r\nand the windows of them were full of people. Behind the vast plate-glass\r\nwindows of the upper floors of a house on the corner one glimpsed\r\nterraced masses of fine-clothed men and women, dim and shimmery, like\r\npeople under water. Under us the square was noiseless, but it was full\r\nof citizens; officials in fine uniforms were flitting about on errands,\r\nand in a doorstep sat a figure in the uttermost raggedness of poverty,\r\nthe feet bare, the head bent humbly down; a youth of eighteen or twenty,\r\nhe was, and through the field-glass one could see that he was tearing\r\napart and munching riffraff that he had gathered somewhere. Blazing\r\nuniforms flashed by him, making a sparkling contrast with his drooping\r\nruin of moldy rags, but he took no notice; he was not there to grieve\r\nfor a nation's disaster; he had his own cares, and deeper. From two\r\ndirections two long files of infantry came plowing through the pack and\r\npress in silence; there was a low, crisp order and the crowd vanished,\r\nthe square save the sidewalks was empty, the private mourner was gone.\r\nAnother order, the soldiers fell apart and enclosed the square in a\r\ndouble-ranked human fence. It was all so swift, noiseless, exact--like a\r\nbeautifully ordered machine.\r\n\r\nIt was noon, now. Two hours of stillness and waiting followed. Then\r\ncarriages began to flow past and deliver the two or three hundred court\r\npersonages and high nobilities privileged to enter the church. Then the\r\nsquare filled up; not with civilians, but with army and navy officers in\r\nshowy and beautiful uniforms. They filled it compactly, leaving only a\r\nnarrow carriage path in front of the church, but there was no civilian\r\namong them. And it was better so; dull clothes would have marred the\r\nradiant spectacle. In the jam in front of the church, on its steps, and\r\non the sidewalk was a bunch of uniforms which made a blazing splotch\r\nof color--intense red, gold, and white--which dimmed the brilliancies\r\naround them; and opposite them on the other side of the path was a bunch\r\nof cascaded bright-green plumes above pale-blue shoulders which made\r\nanother splotch of splendor emphatic and conspicuous in its glowing\r\nsurroundings. It was a sea of flashing color all about, but these two\r\ngroups were the high notes. The green plumes were worn by forty or fifty\r\nAustrian generals, the group opposite them were chiefly Knights of Malta\r\nand knights of a German order. The mass of heads in the square were\r\ncovered by gilt helmets and by military caps roofed with a mirror-like\r\nglaze, and the movements of the wearers caused these things to catch the\r\nsun-rays, and the effect was fine to see--the square was like a garden\r\nof richly colored flowers with a multitude of blinding and flashing\r\nlittle suns distributed over it.\r\n\r\nThink of it--it was by command of that Italian loafer yonder on his\r\nimperial throne in the Geneva prison that this splendid multitude was\r\nassembled there; and the kings and emperors that were entering the\r\nchurch from a side street were there by his will. It is so strange, so\r\nunrealizable.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock the carriages were still streaming by in single\r\nfile. At three-five a cardinal arrives with his attendants; later some\r\nbishops; then a number of archdeacons--all in striking colors that add\r\nto the show. At three-ten a procession of priests passes along, with\r\ncrucifix. Another one, presently; after an interval, two more; at\r\nthree-fifty another one--very long, with many crosses, gold-embroidered\r\nrobes, and much white lace; also great pictured banners, at intervals,\r\nreceding into the distance.\r\n\r\nA hum of tolling bells makes itself heard, but not sharply. At\r\nthree-fifty-eight a waiting interval. Presently a long procession of\r\ngentlemen in evening dress comes in sight and approaches until it is\r\nnear to the square, then falls back against the wall of soldiers at the\r\nsidewalk, and the white shirt-fronts show like snowflakes and are very\r\nconspicuous where so much warm color is all about.\r\n\r\nA waiting pause. At four-twelve the head of the funeral procession comes\r\ninto view at last. First, a body of cavalry, four abreast, to widen the\r\npath. Next, a great body of lancers, in blue, with gilt helmets. Next,\r\nthree six-horse mourning-coaches; outriders and coachmen in black, with\r\ncocked hats and white wigs. Next, troops in splendid uniforms, red,\r\ngold, and white, exceedingly showy.\r\n\r\nNow the multitude uncover. The soldiers present arms; there is a low\r\nrumble of drums; the sumptuous great hearse approaches, drawn at a\r\nwalk by eight black horses plumed with black bunches of nodding ostrich\r\nfeathers; the coffin is borne into the church, the doors are closed.\r\n\r\nThe multitude cover their heads, and the rest of the procession moves\r\nby; first the Hungarian Guard in their indescribably brilliant and\r\npicturesque and beautiful uniform, inherited from the ages of barbaric\r\nsplendor, and after them other mounted forces, a long and showy array.\r\n\r\nThen the shining crown in the square crumbled apart, a wrecked rainbow,\r\nand melted away in radiant streams, and in the turn of a wrist the three\r\ndirtiest and raggedest and cheerfulest little slum-girls in Austria were\r\ncapering about in the spacious vacancy. It was a day of contrasts.\r\n\r\nTwice the Empress entered Vienna in state. The first time was in 1854,\r\nwhen she was a bride of seventeen, and then she rode in measureless\r\npomp and with blare of music through a fluttering world of gay flags and\r\ndecorations, down streets walled on both hands with a press of shouting\r\nand welcoming subjects; and the second time was last Wednesday, when she\r\nentered the city in her coffin and moved down the same streets in the\r\ndead of the night under swaying black flags, between packed human walls\r\nagain; but everywhere was a deep stillness, now--a stillness emphasized,\r\nrather than broken, by the muffled hoofbeats of the long cavalcade over\r\npavements cushioned with sand, and the low sobbing of gray-headed women\r\nwho had witnessed the first entry forty-four years before, when she and\r\nthey were young--and unaware!\r\n\r\nA character in Baron von Berger's recent fairy drama \"Habsburg\" tells\r\nabout that first coming of the girlish Empress-Queen, and in his history\r\ndraws a fine picture: I cannot make a close translation of it, but will\r\ntry to convey the spirit of the verses:\r\n\r\n     I saw the stately pageant pass:\r\n     In her high place I saw the Empress-Queen:\r\n     I could not take my eyes away\r\n     From that fair vision, spirit-like and pure,\r\n     That rose serene, sublime, and figured to my sense\r\n     A noble Alp far lighted in the blue,\r\n     That in the flood of morning rends its veil of cloud\r\n     And stands a dream of glory to the gaze\r\n     Of them that in the Valley toil and plod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SCRAP OF CURIOUS HISTORY\r\n\r\nMarion City, on the Mississippi River, in the State of Missouri--a\r\nvillage; time, 1845. La Bourboule-les-Bains, France--a village; time,\r\nthe end of June, 1894. I was in the one village in that early time; I\r\nam in the other now. These times and places are sufficiently wide\r\napart, yet today I have the strange sense of being thrust back into that\r\nMissourian village and of reliving certain stirring days that I lived\r\nthere so long ago.\r\n\r\nLast Saturday night the life of the President of the French Republic\r\nwas taken by an Italian assassin. Last night a mob surrounded our hotel,\r\nshouting, howling, singing the \"Marseillaise,\" and pelting our windows\r\nwith sticks and stones; for we have Italian waiters, and the mob\r\ndemanded that they be turned out of the house instantly--to be drubbed,\r\nand then driven out of the village. Everybody in the hotel remained up\r\nuntil far into the night, and experienced the several kinds of terror\r\nwhich one reads about in books which tell of night attacks by Italians\r\nand by French mobs: the growing roar of the oncoming crowd; the arrival,\r\nwith rain of stones and a crash of glass; the withdrawal to rearrange\r\nplans--followed by a silence ominous, threatening, and harder to bear\r\nthan even the active siege and the noise. The landlord and the two\r\nvillage policemen stood their ground, and at last the mob was\r\npersuaded to go away and leave our Italians in peace. Today four of\r\nthe ringleaders have been sentenced to heavy punishment of a public\r\nsort--and are become local heroes, by consequence.\r\n\r\nThat is the very mistake which was at first made in the Missourian\r\nvillage half a century ago. The mistake was repeated and repeated--just\r\nas France is doing in these latter months.\r\n\r\nIn our village we had our Ravochals, our Henrys, our Vaillants; and in\r\na humble way our Cesario--I hope I have spelled this name wrong. Fifty\r\nyears ago we passed through, in all essentials, what France has been\r\npassing through during the past two or three years, in the matter of\r\nperiodical frights, horrors, and shudderings.\r\n\r\nIn several details the parallels are quaintly exact. In that day, for a\r\nman to speak out openly and proclaim himself an enemy of negro slavery\r\nwas simply to proclaim himself a madman. For he was blaspheming against\r\nthe holiest thing known to a Missourian, and could NOT be in his right\r\nmind. For a man to proclaim himself an anarchist in France, three years\r\nago, was to proclaim himself a madman--he could not be in his right\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nNow the original old first blasphemer against any institution profoundly\r\nvenerated by a community is quite sure to be in earnest; his followers\r\nand imitators may be humbugs and self-seekers, but he himself is\r\nsincere--his heart is in his protest.\r\n\r\nRobert Hardy was our first ABOLITIONIST--awful name! He was a journeyman\r\ncooper, and worked in the big cooper-shop belonging to the great\r\npork-packing establishment which was Marion City's chief pride and sole\r\nsource of prosperity. He was a New-Englander, a stranger. And, being a\r\nstranger, he was of course regarded as an inferior person--for that has\r\nbeen human nature from Adam down--and of course, also, he was made\r\nto feel unwelcome, for this is the ancient law with man and the other\r\nanimals. Hardy was thirty years old, and a bachelor; pale, given to\r\nreverie and reading. He was reserved, and seemed to prefer the isolation\r\nwhich had fallen to his lot. He was treated to many side remarks by\r\nhis fellows, but as he did not resent them it was decided that he was a\r\ncoward.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden he proclaimed himself an abolitionist--straight out\r\nand publicly! He said that negro slavery was a crime, an infamy. For a\r\nmoment the town was paralyzed with astonishment; then it broke into a\r\nfury of rage and swarmed toward the cooper-shop to lynch Hardy. But\r\nthe Methodist minister made a powerful speech to them and stayed their\r\nhands. He proved to them that Hardy was insane and not responsible for\r\nhis words; that no man COULD be sane and utter such words.\r\n\r\nSo Hardy was saved. Being insane, he was allowed to go on talking.\r\nHe was found to be good entertainment. Several nights running he made\r\nabolition speeches in the open air, and all the town flocked to hear and\r\nlaugh. He implored them to believe him sane and sincere, and have pity\r\non the poor slaves, and take measures for the restoration of their\r\nstolen rights, or in no long time blood would flow--blood, blood, rivers\r\nof blood!\r\n\r\nIt was great fun. But all of a sudden the aspect of things changed. A\r\nslave came flying from Palmyra, the county-seat, a few miles back,\r\nand was about to escape in a canoe to Illinois and freedom in the dull\r\ntwilight of the approaching dawn, when the town constable seized\r\nhim. Hardy happened along and tried to rescue the negro; there was a\r\nstruggle, and the constable did not come out of it alive. Hardy crossed\r\nthe river with the negro, and then came back to give himself up. All\r\nthis took time, for the Mississippi is not a French brook, like the\r\nSeine, the Loire, and those other rivulets, but is a real river nearly\r\na mile wide. The town was on hand in force by now, but the Methodist\r\npreacher and the sheriff had already made arrangements in the interest\r\nof order; so Hardy was surrounded by a strong guard and safely conveyed\r\nto the village calaboose in spite of all the effort of the mob to get\r\nhold of him. The reader will have begun to perceive that this Methodist\r\nminister was a prompt man; a prompt man, with active hands and a good\r\nheadpiece. Williams was his name--Damon Williams; Damon Williams in\r\npublic, Damnation Williams in private, because he was so powerful on\r\nthat theme and so frequent.\r\n\r\nThe excitement was prodigious. The constable was the first man who\r\nhad ever been killed in the town. The event was by long odds the most\r\nimposing in the town's history. It lifted the humble village into sudden\r\nimportance; its name was in everybody's mouth for twenty miles around.\r\nAnd so was the name of Robert Hardy--Robert Hardy, the stranger, the\r\ndespised. In a day he was become the person of most consequence in the\r\nregion, the only person talked about. As to those other coopers, they\r\nfound their position curiously changed--they were important people, or\r\nunimportant, now, in proportion as to how large or how small had been\r\ntheir intercourse with the new celebrity. The two or three who had\r\nreally been on a sort of familiar footing with him found themselves\r\nobjects of admiring interest with the public and of envy with their\r\nshopmates.\r\n\r\nThe village weekly journal had lately gone into new hands. The new man\r\nwas an enterprising fellow, and he made the most of the tragedy. He\r\nissued an extra. Then he put up posters promising to devote his whole\r\npaper to matters connected with the great event--there would be a full\r\nand intensely interesting biography of the murderer, and even a portrait\r\nof him. He was as good as his word. He carved the portrait himself, on\r\nthe back of a wooden type--and a terror it was to look at. It made a\r\ngreat commotion, for this was the first time the village paper had ever\r\ncontained a picture. The village was very proud. The output of the paper\r\nwas ten times as great as it had ever been before, yet every copy was\r\nsold.\r\n\r\nWhen the trial came on, people came from all the farms around, and from\r\nHannibal, and Quincy, and even from Keokuk; and the court-house could\r\nhold only a fraction of the crowd that applied for admission. The trial\r\nwas published in the village paper, with fresh and still more trying\r\npictures of the accused.\r\n\r\nHardy was convicted, and hanged--a mistake. People came from miles\r\naround to see the hanging; they brought cakes and cider, also the women\r\nand children, and made a picnic of the matter. It was the largest crowd\r\nthe village had ever seen. The rope that hanged Hardy was eagerly bought\r\nup, in inch samples, for everybody wanted a memento of the memorable\r\nevent.\r\n\r\nMartyrdom gilded with notoriety has its fascinations. Within one week\r\nafterward four young lightweights in the village proclaimed themselves\r\nabolitionists! In life Hardy had not been able to make a convert;\r\neverybody laughed at him; but nobody could laugh at his legacy. The four\r\nswaggered around with their slouch-hats pulled down over their faces,\r\nand hinted darkly at awful possibilities. The people were troubled\r\nand afraid, and showed it. And they were stunned, too; they could\r\nnot understand it. \"Abolitionist\" had always been a term of shame and\r\nhorror; yet here were four young men who were not only not ashamed to\r\nbear that name, but were grimly proud of it. Respectable young men they\r\nwere, too--of good families, and brought up in the church. Ed Smith, the\r\nprinter's apprentice, nineteen, had been the head Sunday-school boy,\r\nand had once recited three thousand Bible verses without making a break.\r\nDick Savage, twenty, the baker's apprentice; Will Joyce,\r\ntwenty-two, journeyman blacksmith; and Henry Taylor, twenty-four,\r\ntobacco-stemmer--were the other three. They were all of a sentimental\r\ncast; they were all romance-readers; they all wrote poetry, such as\r\nit was; they were all vain and foolish; but they had never before been\r\nsuspected of having anything bad in them.\r\n\r\nThey withdrew from society, and grew more and more mysterious and\r\ndreadful. They presently achieved the distinction of being denounced by\r\nnames from the pulpit--which made an immense stir! This was grandeur,\r\nthis was fame. They were envied by all the other young fellows now. This\r\nwas natural. Their company grew--grew alarmingly. They took a name. It\r\nwas a secret name, and was divulged to no outsider; publicly they were\r\nsimply the abolitionists. They had pass-words, grips, and signs; they\r\nhad secret meetings; their initiations were conducted with gloomy pomps\r\nand ceremonies, at midnight.\r\n\r\nThey always spoke of Hardy as \"the Martyr,\" and every little while\r\nthey moved through the principal street in procession--at midnight,\r\nblack-robed, masked, to the measured tap of the solemn drum--on\r\npilgrimage to the Martyr's grave, where they went through with some\r\nmajestic fooleries and swore vengeance upon his murderers. They gave\r\nprevious notice of the pilgrimage by small posters, and warned everybody\r\nto keep indoors and darken all houses along the route, and leave the\r\nroad empty. These warnings were obeyed, for there was a skull and\r\ncrossbones at the top of the poster.\r\n\r\nWhen this kind of thing had been going on about eight weeks, a quite\r\nnatural thing happened. A few men of character and grit woke up out of\r\nthe nightmare of fear which had been stupefying their faculties, and\r\nbegan to discharge scorn and scoffings at themselves and the community\r\nfor enduring this child's-play; and at the same time they proposed to\r\nend it straightway. Everybody felt an uplift; life was breathed into\r\ntheir dead spirits; their courage rose and they began to feel like\r\nmen again. This was on a Saturday. All day the new feeling grew and\r\nstrengthened; it grew with a rush; it brought inspiration and cheer with\r\nit. Midnight saw a united community, full of zeal and pluck, and with\r\na clearly defined and welcome piece of work in front of it. The best\r\norganizer and strongest and bitterest talker on that great Saturday was\r\nthe Presbyterian clergyman who had denounced the original four from his\r\npulpit--Rev. Hiram Fletcher--and he promised to use his pulpit in the\r\npublic interest again now. On the morrow he had revelations to make, he\r\nsaid--secrets of the dreadful society.\r\n\r\nBut the revelations were never made. At half past two in the morning the\r\ndead silence of the village was broken by a crashing explosion, and\r\nthe town patrol saw the preacher's house spring in a wreck of whirling\r\nfragments into the sky. The preacher was killed, together with a negro\r\nwoman, his only slave and servant.\r\n\r\nThe town was paralyzed again, and with reason. To struggle against a\r\nvisible enemy is a thing worth while, and there is a plenty of men who\r\nstand always ready to undertake it; but to struggle against an invisible\r\none--an invisible one who sneaks in and does his awful work in the dark\r\nand leaves no trace--that is another matter. That is a thing to make the\r\nbravest tremble and hold back.\r\n\r\nThe cowed populace were afraid to go to the funeral. The man who was\r\nto have had a packed church to hear him expose and denounce the common\r\nenemy had but a handful to see him buried. The coroner's jury had\r\nbrought in a verdict of \"death by the visitation of God,\" for no witness\r\ncame forward; if any existed they prudently kept out of the way. Nobody\r\nseemed sorry. Nobody wanted to see the terrible secret society provoked\r\ninto the commission of further outrages. Everybody wanted the tragedy\r\nhushed up, ignored, forgotten, if possible.\r\n\r\nAnd so there was a bitter surprise and an unwelcome one when Will\r\nJoyce, the blacksmith's journeyman, came out and proclaimed himself the\r\nassassin! Plainly he was not minded to be robbed of his glory. He made\r\nhis proclamation, and stuck to it. Stuck to it, and insisted upon\r\na trial. Here was an ominous thing; here was a new and peculiarly\r\nformidable terror, for a motive was revealed here which society could\r\nnot hope to deal with successfully--VANITY, thirst for notoriety. If\r\nmen were going to kill for notoriety's sake, and to win the glory of\r\nnewspaper renown, a big trial, and a showy execution, what possible\r\ninvention of man could discourage or deter them? The town was in a sort\r\nof panic; it did not know what to do.\r\n\r\nHowever, the grand jury had to take hold of the matter--it had no\r\nchoice. It brought in a true bill, and presently the case went to the\r\ncounty court. The trial was a fine sensation. The prisoner was the\r\nprincipal witness for the prosecution. He gave a full account of the\r\nassassination; he furnished even the minutest particulars: how he\r\ndeposited his keg of powder and laid his train--from the house to\r\nsuch-and-such a spot; how George Ronalds and Henry Hart came along just\r\nthen, smoking, and he borrowed Hart's cigar and fired the train with it,\r\nshouting, \"Down with all slave-tyrants!\" and how Hart and Ronalds made\r\nno effort to capture him, but ran away, and had never come forward to\r\ntestify yet.\r\n\r\nBut they had to testify now, and they did--and pitiful it was to see\r\nhow reluctant they were, and how scared. The crowded house listened to\r\nJoyce's fearful tale with a profound and breathless interest, and in a\r\ndeep hush which was not broken till he broke it himself, in concluding,\r\nwith a roaring repetition of his \"Death to all slave-tyrants!\"--which\r\ncame so unexpectedly and so startlingly that it made everyone present\r\ncatch his breath and gasp.\r\n\r\nThe trial was put in the paper, with biography and large portrait,\r\nwith other slanderous and insane pictures, and the edition sold beyond\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nThe execution of Joyce was a fine and picturesque thing. It drew a vast\r\ncrowd. Good places in trees and seats on rail fences sold for half a\r\ndollar apiece; lemonade and gingerbread-stands had great prosperity.\r\nJoyce recited a furious and fantastic and denunciatory speech on the\r\nscaffold which had imposing passages of school-boy eloquence in it, and\r\ngave him a reputation on the spot as an orator, and his name, later,\r\nin the society's records, of the \"Martyr Orator.\" He went to his death\r\nbreathing slaughter and charging his society to \"avenge his murder.\" If\r\nhe knew anything of human nature he knew that to plenty of young fellows\r\npresent in that great crowd he was a grand hero--and enviably situated.\r\n\r\nHe was hanged. It was a mistake. Within a month from his death the\r\nsociety which he had honored had twenty new members, some of them\r\nearnest, determined men. They did not court distinction in the same way,\r\nbut they celebrated his martyrdom. The crime which had been obscure and\r\ndespised had become lofty and glorified.\r\n\r\nSuch things were happening all over the country. Wild-brained martyrdom\r\nwas succeeded by uprising and organization. Then, in natural order,\r\nfollowed riot, insurrection, and the wrack and restitutions of war. It\r\nwas bound to come, and it would naturally come in that way. It has been\r\nthe manner of reform since the beginning of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWITZERLAND, THE CRADLE OF LIBERTY\r\n\r\nInterlaken, Switzerland, 1891.\r\n\r\nIt is a good many years since I was in Switzerland last. In that remote\r\ntime there was only one ladder railway in the country. That state of\r\nthings is all changed. There isn't a mountain in Switzerland now that\r\nhasn't a ladder railroad or two up its back like suspenders; indeed,\r\nsome mountains are latticed with them, and two years hence all will\r\nbe. In that day the peasant of the high altitudes will have to carry a\r\nlantern when he goes visiting in the night to keep from stumbling over\r\nrailroads that have been built since his last round. And also in that\r\nday, if there shall remain a high-altitude peasant whose potato-patch\r\nhasn't a railroad through it, it will make him as conspicuous as\r\nWilliam Tell.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are only two best ways to travel through Switzerland. The\r\nfirst best is afoot. The second best is by open two-horse carriage. One\r\ncan come from Lucerne to Interlaken over the Brunig by ladder railroad\r\nin an hour or so now, but you can glide smoothly in a carriage in ten,\r\nand have two hours for luncheon at noon--for luncheon, not for rest.\r\nThere is no fatigue connected with the trip. One arrives fresh in spirit\r\nand in person in the evening--no fret in his heart, no grime on his\r\nface, no grit in his hair, not a cinder in his eye. This is the right\r\ncondition of mind and body, the right and due preparation for the solemn\r\nevent which closed the day--stepping with metaphorically uncovered head\r\ninto the presence of the most impressive mountain mass that the globe\r\ncan show--the Jungfrau. The stranger's first feeling, when suddenly\r\nconfronted by that towering and awful apparition wrapped in its shroud\r\nof snow, is breath-taking astonishment. It is as if heaven's gates had\r\nswung open and exposed the throne.\r\n\r\nIt is peaceful here and pleasant at Interlaken. Nothing going on--at\r\nleast nothing but brilliant life-giving sunshine. There are floods and\r\nfloods of that. One may properly speak of it as \"going on,\" for it is\r\nfull of the suggestion of activity; the light pours down with energy,\r\nwith visible enthusiasm. This is a good atmosphere to be in, morally\r\nas well as physically. After trying the political atmosphere of the\r\nneighboring monarchies, it is healing and refreshing to breathe in air that\r\nhas known no taint of slavery for six hundred years, and to come among\r\na people whose political history is great and fine, and worthy to be\r\ntaught in all schools and studied by all races and peoples. For the\r\nstruggle here throughout the centuries has not been in the interest of\r\nany private family, or any church, but in the interest of the whole body\r\nof the nation, and for shelter and protection of all forms of belief.\r\nThis fact is colossal. If one would realize how colossal it is, and\r\nof what dignity and majesty, let him contrast it with the purposes and\r\nobjects of the Crusades, the siege of York, the War of the Roses, and\r\nother historic comedies of that sort and size.\r\n\r\nLast week I was beating around the Lake of Four Cantons, and I saw Rutli\r\nand Altorf. Rutli is a remote little patch of a meadow, but I do not know\r\nhow any piece of ground could be holier or better worth crossing oceans\r\nand continents to see, since it was there that the great trinity of\r\nSwitzerland joined hands six centuries ago and swore the oath which set\r\ntheir enslaved and insulted country forever free; and Altorf is also\r\nhonorable ground and worshipful, since it was there that William,\r\nsurnamed Tell (which interpreted means \"The foolish talker\"--that is to\r\nsay, the too-daring talker), refused to bow to Gessler's hat. Of late\r\nyears the prying student of history has been delighting himself beyond\r\nmeasure over a wonderful find which he has made--to wit, that Tell did\r\nnot shoot the apple from his son's head. To hear the students jubilate,\r\none would suppose that the question of whether Tell shot the apple or\r\ndidn't was an important matter; whereas it ranks in importance exactly\r\nwith the question of whether Washington chopped down the cherry-tree or\r\ndidn't. The deeds of Washington, the patriot, are the essential thing;\r\nthe cherry-tree incident is of no consequence. To prove that Tell did\r\nshoot the apple from his son's head would merely prove that he had\r\nbetter nerve than most men and was as skillful with a bow as a million\r\nothers who preceded and followed him, but not one whit more so. But Tell\r\nwas more and better than a mere marksman, more and better than a mere\r\ncool head; he was a type; he stands for Swiss patriotism; in his person\r\nwas represented a whole people; his spirit was their spirit--the spirit\r\nwhich would bow to none but God, the spirit which said this in words\r\nand confirmed it with deeds. There have always been Tells in\r\nSwitzerland--people who would not bow. There was a sufficiency of them\r\nat Rutli; there were plenty of them at Murten; plenty at Grandson; there\r\nare plenty today. And the first of them all--the very first, earliest\r\nbanner-bearer of human freedom in this world--was not a man, but a\r\nwoman--Stauffacher's wife. There she looms dim and great, through the\r\nhaze of the centuries, delivering into her husband's ear that gospel of\r\nrevolt which was to bear fruit in the conspiracy of Rutli and the birth\r\nof the first free government the world had ever seen.\r\n\r\nFrom this Victoria Hotel one looks straight across a flat of trifling\r\nwidth to a lofty mountain barrier, which has a gateway in it shaped like\r\nan inverted pyramid. Beyond this gateway arises the vast bulk of the\r\nJungfrau, a spotless mass of gleaming snow, into the sky. The gateway,\r\nin the dark-colored barrier, makes a strong frame for the great picture.\r\nThe somber frame and the glowing snow-pile are startlingly contrasted.\r\nIt is this frame which concentrates and emphasizes the glory of the\r\nJungfrau and makes it the most engaging and beguiling and fascinating\r\nspectacle that exists on the earth. There are many mountains of snow\r\nthat are as lofty as the Jungfrau and as nobly proportioned, but they\r\nlack the frame. They stand at large; they are intruded upon and elbowed\r\nby neighboring domes and summits, and their grandeur is diminished and\r\nfails of effect.\r\n\r\nIt is a good name, Jungfrau--Virgin. Nothing could be whiter; nothing\r\ncould be purer; nothing could be saintlier of aspect. At six yesterday\r\nevening the great intervening barrier seen through a faint bluish\r\nhaze seemed made of air and substanceless, so soft and rich it was, so\r\nshimmering where the wandering lights touched it and so dim where the\r\nshadows lay. Apparently it was a dream stuff, a work of the imagination,\r\nnothing real about it. The tint was green, slightly varying shades of\r\nit, but mainly very dark. The sun was down--as far as that barrier was\r\nconcerned, but not for the Jungfrau, towering into the heavens beyond\r\nthe gateway. She was a roaring conflagration of blinding white.\r\n\r\nIt is said the Fridolin (the old Fridolin), a new saint, but formerly a\r\nmissionary, gave the mountain its gracious name. He was an Irishman, son\r\nof an Irish king--there were thirty thousand kings reigning in County\r\nCork alone in his time, fifteen hundred years ago. It got so that they\r\ncould not make a living, there was so much competition and wages got cut\r\nso. Some of them were out of work months at a time, with wife and little\r\nchildren to feed, and not a crust in the place. At last a particularly\r\nsevere winter fell upon the country, and hundreds of them were reduced\r\nto mendicancy and were to be seen day after day in the bitterest\r\nweather, standing barefoot in the snow, holding out their crowns for\r\nalms. Indeed, they would have been obliged to emigrate or starve but for\r\na fortunate idea of Prince Fridolin's, who started a labor-union, the\r\nfirst one in history, and got the great bulk of them to join it. He thus\r\nwon the general gratitude, and they wanted to make him emperor--emperor\r\nover them all--emperor of County Cork, but he said, No, walking delegate\r\nwas good enough for him. For behold! he was modest beyond his years,\r\nand keen as a whip. To this day in Germany and Switzerland, where\r\nSt. Fridolin is revered and honored, the peasantry speak of him\r\naffectionately as the first walking delegate.\r\n\r\nThe first walk he took was into France and Germany, missionarying--for\r\nmissionarying was a better thing in those days than it is in ours. All\r\nyou had to do was to cure the head savage's sick daughter by a \"miracle\"--a\r\nmiracle like the miracle of Lourdes in our day, for instance--and\r\nimmediately that head savage was your convert, and filled to the eyes\r\nwith a new convert's enthusiasm. You could sit down and make yourself\r\neasy, now. He would take an ax and convert the rest of the nation\r\nhimself. Charlemagne was that kind of a walking delegate.\r\n\r\nYes, there were great missionaries in those days, for the methods were\r\nsure and the rewards great. We have no such missionaries now, and no\r\nsuch methods.\r\n\r\nBut to continue the history of the first walking delegate, if you are\r\ninterested. I am interested myself because I have seen his relics in\r\nSackingen, and also the very spot where he worked his great miracle--the\r\none which won him his sainthood in the papal court a few centuries\r\nlater. To have seen these things makes me feel very near to him,\r\nalmost like a member of the family, in fact. While wandering about the\r\nContinent he arrived at the spot on the Rhine which is now occupied by\r\nSackingen, and proposed to settle there, but the people warned him off.\r\nHe appealed to the king of the Franks, who made him a present of the\r\nwhole region, people and all. He built a great cloister there for women\r\nand proceeded to teach in it and accumulate more land. There were two\r\nwealthy brothers in the neighborhood, Urso and Landulph. Urso died and\r\nFridolin claimed his estates. Landulph asked for documents and papers.\r\nFridolin had none to show. He said the bequest had been made to him by\r\nword of mouth. Landulph suggested that he produce a witness and said\r\nit in a way which he thought was very witty, very sarcastic. This shows\r\nthat he did not know the walking delegate. Fridolin was not disturbed.\r\nHe said:\r\n\r\n\"Appoint your court. I will bring a witness.\"\r\n\r\nThe court thus created consisted of fifteen counts and barons. A day was\r\nappointed for the trial of the case. On that day the judges took their\r\nseats in state, and proclamation was made that the court was ready for\r\nbusiness. Five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen minutes passed, and yet\r\nno Fridolin appeared. Landulph rose, and was in the act of claiming\r\njudgment by default when a strange clacking sound was heard coming up\r\nthe stairs. In another moment Fridolin entered at the door and came\r\nwalking in a deep hush down the middle aisle, with a tall skeleton\r\nstalking in his rear.\r\n\r\nAmazement and terror sat upon every countenance, for everybody suspected\r\nthat the skeleton was Urso's. It stopped before the chief judge and\r\nraised its bony arm aloft and began to speak, while all the assembly\r\nshuddered, for they could see the words leak out between its ribs. It\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Brother, why dost thou disturb my blessed rest and withhold by robbery\r\nthe gift which I gave thee for the honor of God?\"\r\n\r\nIt seems a strange thing and most irregular, but the verdict was\r\nactually given against Landulph on the testimony of this wandering\r\nrack-heap of unidentified bones. In our day a skeleton would not be\r\nallowed to testify at all, for a skeleton has no moral responsibility,\r\nand its word could not be believed on oath, and this was probably one\r\nof them. Most skeletons are not to be believed on oath, and this was\r\nprobably one of them. However, the incident is valuable as preserving\r\nto us a curious sample of the quaint laws of evidence of that remote\r\ntime--a time so remote, so far back toward the beginning of original\r\nidiocy, that the difference between a bench of judges and a basket of\r\nvegetables was as yet so slight that we may say with all confidence\r\nthat it didn't really exist.\r\n\r\nDuring several afternoons I have been engaged in an interesting, maybe\r\nuseful, piece of work--that is to say, I have been trying to make the\r\nmighty Jungfrau earn her living--earn it in a most humble sphere, but on\r\na prodigious scale, on a prodigious scale of necessity, for she couldn't\r\ndo anything in a small way with her size and style. I have been trying\r\nto make her do service on a stupendous dial and check off the hours as\r\nthey glide along her pallid face up there against the sky, and tell the\r\ntime of day to the populations lying within fifty miles of her and to\r\nthe people in the moon, if they have a good telescope there.\r\n\r\nUntil late in the afternoon the Jungfrau's aspect is that of a spotless\r\ndesert of snow set upon edge against the sky. But by mid-afternoon some\r\nelevations which rise out of the western border of the desert, whose\r\npresence you perhaps had not detected or suspected up to that time,\r\nbegan to cast black shadows eastward across the gleaming surface. At\r\nfirst there is only one shadow; later there are two. Toward 4 P.M. the\r\nother day I was gazing and worshiping as usual when I chanced to notice\r\nthat shadow No. 1 was beginning to take itself something of the shape of\r\nthe human profile. By four the back of the head was good, the military\r\ncap was pretty good, the nose was bold and strong, the upper lip\r\nsharp, but not pretty, and there was a great goatee that shot straight\r\naggressively forward from the chin.\r\n\r\nAt four-thirty the nose had changed its shape considerably, and the\r\naltered slant of the sun had revealed and made conspicuous a huge\r\nbuttress or barrier of naked rock which was so located as to answer\r\nvery well for a shoulder or coat-collar to this swarthy and indiscreet\r\nsweetheart who had stolen out there right before everybody to pillow his\r\nhead on the Virgin's white breast and whisper soft sentimentalities to\r\nher in the sensuous music of the crashing ice-domes and the boom and\r\nthunder of the passing avalanche--music very familiar to his ear, for\r\nhe has heard it every afternoon at this hour since the day he first came\r\ncourting this child of the earth, who lives in the sky, and that day\r\nis far, yes--for he was at this pleasant sport before the Middle Ages\r\ndrifted by him in the valley; before the Romans marched past, and\r\nbefore the antique and recordless barbarians fished and hunted here and\r\nwondered who he might be, and were probably afraid of him; and before\r\nprimeval man himself, just emerged from his four-footed estate, stepped\r\nout upon this plain, first sample of his race, a thousand centuries ago,\r\nand cast a glad eye up there, judging he had found a brother human being\r\nand consequently something to kill; and before the big saurians wallowed\r\nhere, still some eons earlier. Oh yes, a day so far back that the\r\neternal son was present to see that first visit; a day so far back that\r\nneither tradition nor history was born yet and a whole weary eternity\r\nmust come and go before the restless little creature, of whose face this\r\nstupendous Shadow Face was the prophecy, would arrive in the earth and\r\nbegin his shabby career and think it a big thing. Oh, indeed yes;\r\nwhen you talk about your poor Roman and Egyptian day-before-yesterday\r\nantiquities, you should choose a time when the hoary Shadow Face of the\r\nJungfrau is not by. It antedates all antiquities known or imaginable;\r\nfor it was here the world itself created the theater of future\r\nantiquities. And it is the only witness with a human face that was there\r\nto see the marvel, and remains to us a memorial of it.\r\n\r\nBy 4:40 P.M. the nose of the shadow is perfect and is beautiful. It is\r\nblack and is powerfully marked against the upright canvas of glowing\r\nsnow, and covers hundreds of acres of that resplendent surface.\r\n\r\nMeantime shadow No. 2 has been creeping out well to the rear of the face\r\nwest of it--and at five o'clock has assumed a shape that has rather a\r\npoor and rude semblance of a shoe.\r\n\r\nMeantime, also, the great Shadow Face has been gradually changing for\r\ntwenty minutes, and now, 5 P.M., it is becoming a quite fair portrait of\r\nRoscoe Conkling. The likeness is there, and is unmistakable. The goatee\r\nis shortened, now, and has an end; formerly it hadn't any, but ran off\r\neastward and arrived nowhere.\r\n\r\nBy 6 P.M. the face has dissolved and gone, and the goatee has become\r\nwhat looks like the shadow of a tower with a pointed roof, and the shoe\r\nhad turned into what the printers call a \"fist\" with a finger pointing.\r\n\r\nIf I were now imprisoned on a mountain summit a hundred miles northward\r\nof this point, and was denied a timepiece, I could get along well enough\r\nfrom four till six on clear days, for I could keep trace of the time by\r\nthe changing shapes of these mighty shadows on the Virgin's front, the\r\nmost stupendous dial I am acquainted with, the oldest clock in the world\r\nby a couple of million years.\r\n\r\nI suppose I should not have noticed the forms of the shadows if I hadn't\r\nthe habit of hunting for faces in the clouds and in mountain crags--a\r\nsort of amusement which is very entertaining even when you don't find\r\nany, and brilliantly satisfying when you do. I have searched through\r\nseveral bushels of photographs of the Jungfrau here, but found only one\r\nwith the Face in it, and in this case it was not strictly recognizable\r\nas a face, which was evidence that the picture was taken before four\r\no'clock in the afternoon, and also evidence that all the photographers\r\nhave persistently overlooked one of the most fascinating features of\r\nthe Jungfrau show. I say fascinating, because if you once detect a human\r\nface produced on a great plan by unconscious nature, you never get tired\r\nof watching it. At first you can't make another person see it at all,\r\nbut after he has made it out once he can't see anything else afterward.\r\n\r\nThe King of Greece is a man who goes around quietly enough when off\r\nduty. One day this summer he was traveling in an ordinary first-class\r\ncompartment, just in his other suit, the one which he works the realm\r\nin when he is at home, and so he was not looking like anybody in\r\nparticular, but a good deal like everybody in general. By and by a\r\nhearty and healthy German-American got in and opened up a frank and\r\ninteresting and sympathetic conversation with him, and asked him a\r\ncouple of thousand questions about himself, which the king answered\r\ngood-naturedly, but in a more or less indefinite way as to private\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\n\"Where do you live when you are at home?\"\r\n\r\n\"In Greece.\"\r\n\r\n\"Greece! Well, now, that is just astonishing! Born there?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you speak Greek?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, ain't that strange! I never expected to live to see that. What\r\nis your trade? I mean how do you get your living? What is your line of\r\nbusiness?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I hardly know how to answer. I am only a kind of foreman, on a\r\nsalary; and the business--well, is a very general kind of business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I understand--general jobbing--little of everything--anything that\r\nthere's money in.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's about it, yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you traveling for the house now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, partly; but not entirely. Of course I do a stroke of business if\r\nit falls in the way--\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! I like that in you! That's me every time. Go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was only going to say I am off on my vacation now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well that's all right. No harm in that. A man works all the better\r\nfor a little let-up now and then. Not that I've been used to having it\r\nmyself; for I haven't. I reckon this is my first. I was born in Germany,\r\nand when I was a couple of weeks old shipped for America, and I've been\r\nthere ever since, and that's sixty-four years by the watch. I'm\r\nan American in principle and a German at heart, and it's the boss\r\ncombination. Well, how do you get along, as a rule--pretty fair?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've a rather large family--\"\r\n\r\n\"There, that's it--big family and trying to raise them on a salary. Now,\r\nwhat did you go to do that for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I thought--\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you did. You were young and confident and thought you could\r\nbranch out and make things go with a whirl, and here you are, you see!\r\nBut never mind about that. I'm not trying to discourage you. Dear me!\r\nI've been just where you are myself! You've got good grit; there's good\r\nstuff in you, I can see that. You got a wrong start, that's the whole\r\ntrouble. But you hold your grip, and we'll see what can be done. Your\r\ncase ain't half as bad as it might be. You are going to come out all\r\nright--I'm bail for that. Boys and girls?\"\r\n\r\n\"My family? Yes, some of them are boys--\"\r\n\r\n\"And the rest girls. It's just as I expected. But that's all right, and\r\nit's better so, anyway. What are the boys doing--learning a trade?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, no--I thought--\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a great mistake. It's the biggest mistake you ever made. You see\r\nthat in your own case. A man ought always to have a trade to fall back\r\non. Now, I was harness-maker at first. Did that prevent me from becoming\r\none of the biggest brewers in America? Oh no. I always had the harness\r\ntrick to fall back on in rough weather. Now, if you had learned how to\r\nmake harness--However, it's too late now; too late. But it's no good\r\nplan to cry over spilt milk. But as to the boys, you see--what's to\r\nbecome of them if anything happens to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It has been my idea to let the eldest one succeed me--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come! Suppose the firm don't want him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hadn't thought of that, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, look here; you want to get right down to business and stop\r\ndreaming. You are capable of immense things--man. You can make a perfect\r\nsuccess in life. All you want is somebody to steady you and boost you\r\nalong on the right road. Do you own anything in the business?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--not exactly; but if I continue to give satisfaction, I suppose I\r\ncan keep my--\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep your place--yes. Well, don't you depend on anything of the kind.\r\nThey'll bounce you the minute you get a little old and worked out;\r\nthey'll do it sure. Can't you manage somehow to get into the firm?\r\nThat's the great thing, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it is doubtful; very doubtful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Um--that's bad--yes, and unfair, too. Do you suppose that if I should\r\ngo there and have a talk with your people--Look here--do you think you\r\ncould run a brewery?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have never tried, but I think I could do it after I got a little\r\nfamiliarity with the business.\"\r\n\r\nThe German was silent for some time. He did a good deal of thinking,\r\nand the king waited with curiosity to see what the result was going to be.\r\nFinally the German said:\r\n\r\n\"My mind's made up. You leave that crowd--you'll never amount to\r\nanything there. In these old countries they never give a fellow a show.\r\nYes, you come over to America--come to my place in Rochester; bring the\r\nfamily along. You shall have a show in the business and the foremanship,\r\nbesides. George--you said your name was George?--I'll make a man of you.\r\nI give you my word. You've never had a chance here, but that's all going\r\nto change. By gracious! I'll give you a lift that'll make your hair\r\ncurl!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE SHRINE OF ST. WAGNER\r\n\r\nBayreuth, Aug. 2d, 1891\r\n\r\nIt was at Nuremberg that we struck the inundation of music-mad strangers\r\nthat was rolling down upon Bayreuth. It had been long since we had\r\nseen such multitudes of excited and struggling people. It took a good\r\nhalf-hour to pack them and pair them into the train--and it was the\r\nlongest train we have yet seen in Europe. Nuremberg had been witnessing\r\nthis sort of experience a couple of times a day for about two weeks.\r\nIt gives one an impressive sense of the magnitude of this biennial\r\npilgrimage. For a pilgrimage is what it is. The devotees come from the\r\nvery ends of the earth to worship their prophet in his own Kaaba in his\r\nown Mecca.\r\n\r\nIf you are living in New York or San Francisco or Chicago or anywhere\r\nelse in America, and you conclude, by the middle of May, that you would\r\nlike to attend the Bayreuth opera two months and a half later, you must\r\nuse the cable and get about it immediately or you will get no seats,\r\nand you must cable for lodgings, too. Then if you are lucky you will\r\nget seats in the last row and lodgings in the fringe of the town. If\r\nyou stop to write you will get nothing. There were plenty of people\r\nin Nuremberg when we passed through who had come on pilgrimage without\r\nfirst securing seats and lodgings. They had found neither in Bayreuth;\r\nthey had walked Bayreuth streets a while in sorrow, then had gone to\r\nNuremberg and found neither beds nor standing room, and had walked those\r\nquaint streets all night, waiting for the hotels to open and empty their\r\nguests into the trains, and so make room for these, their defeated brethren\r\nand sisters in the faith. They had endured from thirty to forty hours'\r\nrailroading on the continent of Europe--with all which that implies of\r\nworry, fatigue, and financial impoverishment--and all they had got\r\nand all they were to get for it was handiness and accuracy in kicking\r\nthemselves, acquired by practice in the back streets of the two\r\ntowns when other people were in bed; for back they must go over\r\nthat unspeakable journey with their pious mission unfulfilled. These\r\nhumiliated outcasts had the frowsy and unbrushed and apologetic look of\r\nwet cats, and their eyes were glazed with drowsiness, their bodies were\r\nadroop from crown to sole, and all kind-hearted people refrained from\r\nasking them if they had been to Bayreuth and failed to connect, as\r\nknowing they would lie.\r\n\r\nWe reached here (Bayreuth) about mid-afternoon of a rainy Saturday. We\r\nwere of the wise, and had secured lodgings and opera seats months in\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nI am not a musical critic, and did not come here to write essays about\r\nthe operas and deliver judgment upon their merits. The little\r\nchildren of Bayreuth could do that with a finer sympathy and a broader\r\nintelligence than I. I only care to bring four or five pilgrims to the\r\noperas, pilgrims able to appreciate them and enjoy them. What I write\r\nabout the performance to put in my odd time would be offered to the\r\npublic as merely a cat's view of a king, and not of didactic value.\r\n\r\nNext day, which was Sunday, we left for the opera-house--that is to say,\r\nthe Wagner temple--a little after the middle of the afternoon. The\r\ngreat building stands all by itself, grand and lonely, on a high ground\r\noutside the town. We were warned that if we arrived after four o'clock\r\nwe should be obliged to pay two dollars and a half apiece extra by way of\r\nfine. We saved that; and it may be remarked here that this is the only\r\nopportunity that Europe offers of saving money. There was a big crowd\r\nin the grounds about the building, and the ladies' dresses took the sun\r\nwith fine effect. I do not mean to intimate that the ladies were in full\r\ndress, for that was not so. The dresses were pretty, but neither sex was\r\nin evening dress.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the building is simple--severely so; but there is no\r\noccasion for color and decoration, since the people sit in the dark.\r\nThe auditorium has the shape of a keystone, with the stage at the narrow\r\nend. There is an aisle on each side, but no aisle in the body of the\r\nhouse. Each row of seats extends in an unbroken curve from one side of\r\nthe house to the other. There are seven entrance doors on each side of\r\nthe theater and four at the butt, eighteen doors to admit and emit 1,650\r\npersons. The number of the particular door by which you are to enter the\r\nhouse or leave it is printed on your ticket, and you can use no door but\r\nthat one. Thus, crowding and confusion are impossible. Not so many as\r\na hundred people use any one door. This is better than having the usual\r\n(and useless) elaborate fireproof arrangements. It is the model theater\r\nof the world. It can be emptied while the second hand of a watch makes\r\nits circuit. It would be entirely safe, even if it were built of lucifer\r\nmatches.\r\n\r\nIf your seat is near the center of a row and you enter late you must\r\nwork your way along a rank of about twenty-five ladies and gentlemen to\r\nget to it. Yet this causes no trouble, for everybody stands up until\r\nall the seats are full, and the filling is accomplished in a very few\r\nminutes. Then all sit down, and you have a solid mass of fifteen hundred\r\nheads, making a steep cellar-door slant from the rear of the house down\r\nto the stage.\r\n\r\nAll the lights were turned low, so low that the congregation sat in a\r\ndeep and solemn gloom. The funereal rustling of dresses and the low buzz\r\nof conversation began to die swiftly down, and presently not the ghost\r\nof a sound was left. This profound and increasingly impressive stillness\r\nendured for some time--the best preparation for music, spectacle, or\r\nspeech conceivable. I should think our show people would have invented\r\nor imported that simple and impressive device for securing and\r\nsolidifying the attention of an audience long ago; instead of which\r\nthey continue to this day to open a performance against a deadly\r\ncompetition in the form of noise, confusion, and a scattered interest.\r\n\r\nFinally, out of darkness and distance and mystery soft rich notes rose\r\nupon the stillness, and from his grave the dead magician began to\r\nweave his spells about his disciples and steep their souls in his\r\nenchantments. There was something strangely impressive in the fancy\r\nwhich kept intruding itself that the composer was conscious in his grave\r\nof what was going on here, and that these divine sounds were the clothing\r\nof thoughts which were at this moment passing through his brain, and\r\nnot recognized and familiar ones which had issued from it at some former\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe entire overture, long as it was, was played to a dark house with\r\nthe curtain down. It was exquisite; it was delicious. But straightway\r\nthereafter, of course, came the singing, and it does seem to me that\r\nnothing can make a Wagner opera absolutely perfect and satisfactory to\r\nthe untutored but to leave out the vocal parts. I wish I could see a\r\nWagner opera done in pantomime once. Then one would have the lovely\r\norchestration unvexed to listen to and bathe his spirit in, and the\r\nbewildering beautiful scenery to intoxicate his eyes with, and the dumb\r\nacting couldn't mar these pleasures, because there isn't often anything\r\nin the Wagner opera that one would call by such a violent name as\r\nacting; as a rule all you would see would be a couple of silent people,\r\none of them standing still, the other catching flies. Of course I do not\r\nreally mean that he would be catching flies; I only mean that the usual\r\noperatic gestures which consist in reaching first one hand out into\r\nthe air and then the other might suggest the sport I speak of if the\r\noperator attended strictly to business and uttered no sound.\r\n\r\nThis present opera was \"Parsifal.\" Madame Wagner does not permit its\r\nrepresentation anywhere but in Bayreuth. The first act of the three\r\noccupied two hours, and I enjoyed that in spite of the singing.\r\n\r\nI trust that I know as well as anybody that singing is one of the most\r\nentrancing and bewitching and moving and eloquent of all the vehicles\r\ninvented by man for the conveying of feeling; but it seems to me that\r\nthe chief virtue in song is melody, air, tune, rhythm, or what you\r\nplease to call it, and that when this feature is absent what remains is\r\na picture with the color left out. I was not able to detect in the vocal\r\nparts of \"Parsifal\" anything that might with confidence be called rhythm\r\nor tune or melody; one person performed at a time--and a long time,\r\ntoo--often in a noble, and always in a high-toned, voice; but he only\r\npulled out long notes, then some short ones, then another long one, then\r\na sharp, quick, peremptory bark or two--and so on and so on; and when\r\nhe was done you saw that the information which he had conveyed had not\r\ncompensated for the disturbance. Not always, but pretty often. If two of\r\nthem would but put in a duet occasionally and blend the voices; but no,\r\nthey don't do that. The great master, who knew so well how to make\r\na hundred instruments rejoice in unison and pour out their souls in\r\nmingled and melodious tides of delicious sound, deals only in barren\r\nsolos when he puts in the vocal parts. It may be that he was deep, and\r\nonly added the singing to his operas for the sake of the contrast it\r\nwould make with the music. Singing! It does seem the wrong name to\r\napply to it. Strictly described, it is a practicing of difficult and\r\nunpleasant intervals, mainly. An ignorant person gets tired of listening\r\nto gymnastic intervals in the long run, no matter how pleasant they may\r\nbe. In \"Parsifal\" there is a hermit named Gurnemanz who stands on the\r\nstage in one spot and practices by the hour, while first one and then\r\nanother character of the cast endures what he can of it and then retires\r\nto die.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening there was an intermission of three-quarters of an\r\nhour after the first act and one an hour long after the second. In both\r\ninstances the theater was totally emptied. People who had previously\r\nengaged tables in the one sole eating-house were able to put in their\r\ntime very satisfactorily; the other thousand went hungry. The opera was\r\nconcluded at ten in the evening or a little later. When we reached home\r\nwe had been gone more than seven hours. Seven hours at five dollars a\r\nticket is almost too much for the money.\r\n\r\nWhile browsing about the front yard among the crowd between the acts I\r\nencountered twelve or fifteen friends from different parts of America,\r\nand those of them who were most familiar with Wagner said that\r\n\"Parsifal\" seldom pleased at first, but that after one had heard\r\nit several times it was almost sure to become a favorite. It seemed\r\nimpossible, but it was true, for the statement came from people whose\r\nword was not to be doubted.\r\n\r\nAnd I gathered some further information. On the ground I found part of\r\na German musical magazine, and in it a letter written by Uhlic\r\nthirty-three years ago, in which he defends the scorned and abused\r\nWagner against people like me, who found fault with the comprehensive\r\nabsence of what our kind regards as singing. Uhlic says Wagner despised\r\n\"JENE PLAPPERUDE MUSIC,\" and therefore \"runs, trills, and SCHNORKEL are\r\ndiscarded by him.\" I don't know what a SCHNORKEL is, but now that I know\r\nit has been left out of these operas I never have missed so much in\r\nmy life. And Uhlic further says that Wagner's song is true: that it\r\nis \"simply emphasized intoned speech.\" That certainly describes it--in\r\n\"Parsifal\" and some of the other operas; and if I understand Uhlic's elaborate\r\nGerman he apologizes for the beautiful airs in \"Tannhauser.\" Very well;\r\nnow that Wagner and I understand each other, perhaps we shall get along\r\nbetter, and I shall stop calling Waggner, on the American plan, and\r\nthereafter call him Waggner as per German custom, for I feel entirely\r\nfriendly now. The minute we get reconciled to a person, how willing\r\nwe are to throw aside little needless punctilios and pronounce his name\r\nright!\r\n\r\nOf course I came home wondering why people should come from all corners\r\nof America to hear these operas, when we have lately had a season or two\r\nof them in New York with these same singers in the several parts,\r\nand possibly this same orchestra. I resolved to think that out at all\r\nhazards.\r\n\r\nTUESDAY.--Yesterday they played the only operatic favorite I have ever\r\nhad--an opera which has always driven me mad with ignorant delight\r\nwhenever I have heard it--\"Tannhauser.\" I heard it first when I was a\r\nyouth; I heard it last in the last German season in New York. I was\r\nbusy yesterday and I did not intend to go, knowing I should have another\r\n\"Tannhauser\" opportunity in a few days; but after five o'clock I found\r\nmyself free and walked out to the opera-house and arrived about the\r\nbeginning of the second act. My opera ticket admitted me to the grounds\r\nin front, past the policeman and the chain, and I thought I would take a\r\nrest on a bench for an hour and two and wait for the third act.\r\n\r\nIn a moment or so the first bugles blew, and the multitude began to\r\ncrumble apart and melt into the theater. I will explain that this\r\nbugle-call is one of the pretty features here. You see, the theater\r\nis empty, and hundreds of the audience are a good way off in the\r\nfeeding-house; the first bugle-call is blown about a quarter of an\r\nhour before time for the curtain to rise. This company of buglers, in\r\nuniform, march out with military step and send out over the landscape\r\na few bars of the theme of the approaching act, piercing the distances\r\nwith the gracious notes; then they march to the other entrance and\r\nrepeat. Presently they do this over again. Yesterday only about two\r\nhundred people were still left in front of the house when the second\r\ncall was blown; in another half-minute they would have been in the\r\nhouse, but then a thing happened which delayed them--the only solitary\r\nthing in this world which could be relied on with certainty to\r\naccomplish this, I suppose--an imperial princess appeared in the balcony\r\nabove them. They stopped dead in their tracks and began to gaze in a\r\nstupor of gratitude and satisfaction. The lady presently saw that she\r\nmust disappear or the doors would be closed upon these worshipers, so\r\nshe returned to her box. This daughter-in-law of an emperor was pretty;\r\nshe had a kind face; she was without airs; she is known to be full of\r\ncommon human sympathies. There are many kinds of princesses, but this\r\nkind is the most harmful of all, for wherever they go they reconcile\r\npeople to monarchy and set back the clock of progress. The valuable\r\nprinces, the desirable princes, are the czars and their sort. By their\r\nmere dumb presence in the world they cover with derision every argument\r\nthat can be invented in favor of royalty by the most ingenious casuist.\r\nIn his time the husband of this princess was valuable. He led a degraded\r\nlife, he ended it with his own hand in circumstances and surroundings of\r\na hideous sort, and was buried like a god.\r\n\r\nIn the opera-house there is a long loft back of the audience, a kind of\r\nopen gallery, in which princes are displayed. It is sacred to them;\r\nit is the holy of holies. As soon as the filling of the house is\r\nabout complete the standing multitude turn and fix their eyes upon\r\nthe princely layout and gaze mutely and longingly and adoringly\r\nand regretfully like sinners looking into heaven. They become rapt,\r\nunconscious, steeped in worship. There is no spectacle anywhere that is\r\nmore pathetic than this. It is worth crossing many oceans to see. It\r\nis somehow not the same gaze that people rivet upon a Victor Hugo,\r\nor Niagara, or the bones of the mastodon, or the guillotine of the\r\nRevolution, or the great pyramid, or distant Vesuvius smoking in the\r\nsky, or any man long celebrated to you by his genius and achievements,\r\nor thing long celebrated to you by the praises of books and\r\npictures--no, that gaze is only the gaze of intense curiosity, interest,\r\nwonder, engaged in drinking delicious deep draughts that taste good all\r\nthe way down and appease and satisfy the thirst of a lifetime. Satisfy\r\nit--that is the word. Hugo and the mastodon will still have a degree\r\nof intense interest thereafter when encountered, but never anything\r\napproaching the ecstasy of that first view. The interest of a prince is\r\ndifferent. It may be envy, it may be worship, doubtless it is a mixture\r\nof both--and it does not satisfy its thirst with one view, or even\r\nnoticeably diminish it. Perhaps the essence of the thing is the value\r\nwhich men attach to a valuable something which has come by luck and not\r\nbeen earned. A dollar picked up in the road is more satisfaction to you\r\nthan the ninety-and-nine which you had to work for, and money won at\r\nfaro or in stocks snuggles into your heart in the same way. A prince\r\npicks up grandeur, power, and a permanent holiday and gratis support by\r\na pure accident, the accident of birth, and he stands always before\r\nthe grieved eye of poverty and obscurity a monumental representative of\r\nluck. And then--supremest value of all-his is the only high fortune\r\non the earth which is secure. The commercial millionaire may become\r\na beggar; the illustrious statesman can make a vital mistake and be\r\ndropped and forgotten; the illustrious general can lose a decisive\r\nbattle and with it the consideration of men; but once a prince always a\r\nprince--that is to say, an imitation god, and neither hard fortune nor\r\nan infamous character nor an addled brain nor the speech of an ass can\r\nundeify him. By common consent of all the nations and all the ages the\r\nmost valuable thing in this world is the homage of men, whether deserved\r\nor undeserved. It follows without doubt or question, then, that the most\r\ndesirable position possible is that of a prince. And I think it also\r\nfollows that the so-called usurpations with which history is littered\r\nare the most excusable misdemeanors which men have committed. To usurp a\r\nusurpation--that is all it amounts to, isn't it?\r\n\r\nA prince is not to us what he is to a European, of course. We have\r\nnot been taught to regard him as a god, and so one good look at him is\r\nlikely to so nearly appease our curiosity as to make him an object of\r\nno greater interest the next time. We want a fresh one. But it is not so\r\nwith the European. I am quite sure of it. The same old one will answer;\r\nhe never stales. Eighteen years ago I was in London and I called at an\r\nEnglishman's house on a bleak and foggy and dismal December afternoon\r\nto visit his wife and married daughter by appointment. I waited half an\r\nhour and then they arrived, frozen. They explained that they had\r\nbeen delayed by an unlooked-for circumstance: while passing in the\r\nneighborhood of Marlborough House they saw a crowd gathering and were\r\ntold that the Prince of Wales was about to drive out, so they stopped\r\nto get a sight of him. They had waited half an hour on the sidewalk,\r\nfreezing with the crowd, but were disappointed at last--the Prince had\r\nchanged his mind. I said, with a good deal of surprise, \"Is it possible\r\nthat you two have lived in London all your lives and have never seen the\r\nPrince of Wales?\"\r\n\r\nApparently it was their turn to be surprised, for they exclaimed: \"What\r\nan idea! Why, we have seen him hundreds of times.\"\r\n\r\nThey had seen him hundreds of times, yet they had waited half an hour\r\nin the gloom and the bitter cold, in the midst of a jam of patients from\r\nthe same asylum, on the chance of seeing him again. It was a stupefying\r\nstatement, but one is obliged to believe the English, even when they say\r\na thing like that. I fumbled around for a remark, and got out this one:\r\n\r\n\"I can't understand it at all. If I had never seen General Grant I doubt\r\nif I would do that even to get a sight of him.\" With a slight emphasis\r\non the last word.\r\n\r\nTheir blank faces showed that they wondered where the parallel came in.\r\nThen they said, blankly: \"Of course not. He is only a President.\"\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless a fact that a prince is a permanent interest, an\r\ninterest not subject to deterioration. The general who was never\r\ndefeated, the general who never held a council of war, the only general\r\nwho ever commanded a connected battle-front twelve hundred miles long,\r\nthe smith who welded together the broken parts of a great republic and\r\nre-established it where it is quite likely to outlast all the monarchies\r\npresent and to come, was really a person of no serious consequence to\r\nthese people. To them, with their training, my General was only a man,\r\nafter all, while their Prince was clearly much more than that--a being\r\nof a wholly unsimilar construction and constitution, and being of no\r\nmore blood and kinship with men than are the serene eternal lights of\r\nthe firmament with the poor dull tallow candles of commerce that sputter\r\nand die and leave nothing behind but a pinch of ashes and a stink.\r\n\r\nI saw the last act of \"Tannhauser.\" I sat in the gloom and the deep\r\nstillness, waiting--one minute, two minutes, I do not know exactly how\r\nlong--then the soft music of the hidden orchestra began to breathe its\r\nrich, long sighs out from under the distant stage, and by and by the\r\ndrop-curtain parted in the middle and was drawn softly aside, disclosing\r\nthe twilighted wood and a wayside shrine, with a white-robed girl\r\npraying and a man standing near. Presently that noble chorus of men's\r\nvoices was heard approaching, and from that moment until the closing\r\nof the curtain it was music, just music--music to make one drunk with\r\npleasure, music to make one take scrip and staff and beg his way round\r\nthe globe to hear it.\r\n\r\nTo such as are intending to come here in the Wagner season next year I\r\nwish to say, bring your dinner-pail with you. If you do, you will never\r\ncease to be thankful. If you do not, you will find it a hard fight to\r\nsave yourself from famishing in Bayreuth. Bayreuth is merely a large\r\nvillage, and has no very large hotels or eating-houses. The principal\r\ninns are the Golden Anchor and the Sun. At either of these places you\r\ncan get an excellent meal--no, I mean you can go there and see other\r\npeople get it. There is no charge for this. The town is littered with\r\nrestaurants, but they are small and bad, and they are overdriven with\r\ncustom. You must secure a table hours beforehand, and often when you\r\narrive you will find somebody occupying it. We have had this experience.\r\nWe have had a daily scramble for life; and when I say we, I include\r\nshoals of people. I have the impression that the only people who do\r\nnot have to scramble are the veterans--the disciples who have been here\r\nbefore and know the ropes. I think they arrive about a week before the\r\nfirst opera, and engage all the tables for the season. My tribe had\r\ntried all kinds of places--some outside of the town, a mile or two--and\r\nhave captured only nibblings and odds and ends, never in any instance\r\na complete and satisfying meal. Digestible? No, the reverse. These odds\r\nand ends are going to serve as souvenirs of Bayreuth, and in that regard\r\ntheir value is not to be overestimated. Photographs fade, bric-a-brac\r\ngets lost, busts of Wagner get broken, but once you absorb a\r\nBayreuth-restaurant meal it is your possession and your property until\r\nthe time comes to embalm the rest of you. Some of these pilgrims here\r\nbecome, in effect, cabinets; cabinets of souvenirs of Bayreuth. It is\r\nbelieved among scientists that you could examine the crop of a dead\r\nBayreuth pilgrim anywhere in the earth and tell where he came from.\r\nBut I like this ballast. I think a \"Hermitage\" scrap-up at eight in the\r\nevening, when all the famine-breeders have been there and laid in their\r\nmementoes and gone, is the quietest thing you can lay on your keelson\r\nexcept gravel.\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY.--They keep two teams of singers in stock for the chief roles,\r\nand one of these is composed of the most renowned artists in the\r\nworld, with Materna and Alvary in the lead. I suppose a double team is\r\nnecessary; doubtless a single team would die of exhaustion in a week,\r\nfor all the plays last from four in the afternoon till ten at night.\r\nNearly all the labor falls upon the half-dozen head singers, and\r\napparently they are required to furnish all the noise they can for\r\nthe money. If they feel a soft, whispery, mysterious feeling they are\r\nrequired to open out and let the public know it. Operas are given only\r\non Sundays, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, with three days of\r\nostensible rest per week, and two teams to do the four operas; but the\r\nostensible rest is devoted largely to rehearsing. It is said that the\r\noff days are devoted to rehearsing from some time in the morning till\r\nten at night. Are there two orchestras also? It is quite likely, since\r\nthere are one hundred and ten names in the orchestra list.\r\n\r\nYesterday the opera was \"Tristan and Isolde.\" I have seen all sorts\r\nof audiences--at theaters, operas, concerts, lectures, sermons,\r\nfunerals--but none which was twin to the Wagner audience of Bayreuth\r\nfor fixed and reverential attention. Absolute attention and petrified\r\nretention to the end of an act of the attitude assumed at the beginning\r\nof it. You detect no movement in the solid mass of heads and shoulders.\r\nYou seem to sit with the dead in the gloom of a tomb. You know that they\r\nare being stirred to their profoundest depths; that there are times when\r\nthey want to rise and wave handkerchiefs and shout their approbation,\r\nand times when tears are running down their faces, and it would be a\r\nrelief to free their pent emotions in sobs or screams; yet you hear not\r\none utterance till the curtain swings together and the closing strains\r\nhave slowly faded out and died; then the dead rise with one impulse and\r\nshake the building with their applause. Every seat is full in the\r\nfirst act; there is not a vacant one in the last. If a man would be\r\nconspicuous, let him come here and retire from the house in the midst of\r\nan act. It would make him celebrated.\r\n\r\nThis audience reminds me of nothing I have ever seen and of nothing\r\nI have read about except the city in the Arabian tale where all the\r\ninhabitants have been turned to brass and the traveler finds them after\r\ncenturies mute, motionless, and still retaining the attitudes which they\r\nlast knew in life. Here the Wagner audience dress as they please, and\r\nsit in the dark and worship in silence. At the Metropolitan in New York\r\nthey sit in a glare, and wear their showiest harness; they hum airs,\r\nthey squeak fans, they titter, and they gabble all the time. In some\r\nof the boxes the conversation and laughter are so loud as to divide the\r\nattention of the house with the stage. In large measure the Metropolitan\r\nis a show-case for rich fashionables who are not trained in Wagnerian\r\nmusic and have no reverence for it, but who like to promote art and show\r\ntheir clothes.\r\n\r\nCan that be an agreeable atmosphere to persons in whom this music\r\nproduces a sort of divine ecstasy and to whom its creator is a very\r\ndeity, his stage a temple, the works of his brain and hands consecrated\r\nthings, and the partaking of them with eye and ear a sacred solemnity?\r\nManifestly, no. Then, perhaps the temporary expatriation, the tedious\r\ntraversing of seas and continents, the pilgrimage to Bayreuth stands\r\nexplained. These devotees would worship in an atmosphere of devotion.\r\nIt is only here that they can find it without fleck or blemish or any\r\nworldly pollution. In this remote village there are no sights to see,\r\nthere is no newspaper to intrude the worries of the distant world,\r\nthere is nothing going on, it is always Sunday. The pilgrim wends to his\r\ntemple out of town, sits out his moving service, returns to his bed with\r\nhis heart and soul and his body exhausted by long hours of tremendous\r\nemotion, and he is in no fit condition to do anything but to lie torpid\r\nand slowly gather back life and strength for the next service. This\r\nopera of \"Tristan and Isolde\" last night broke the hearts of all\r\nwitnesses who were of the faith, and I know of some who have heard of\r\nmany who could not sleep after it, but cried the night away. I feel\r\nstrongly out of place here. Sometimes I feel like the sane person in a\r\ncommunity of the mad; sometimes I feel like the one blind man where all\r\nothers see; the one groping savage in the college of the learned, and\r\nalways, during service, I feel like a heretic in heaven.\r\n\r\nBut by no means do I ever overlook or minify the fact that this is one\r\nof the most extraordinary experiences of my life. I have never seen\r\nanything like this before. I have never seen anything so great and fine\r\nand real as this devotion.\r\n\r\nFRIDAY.--Yesterday's opera was \"Parsifal\" again. The others went and\r\nthey show marked advance in appreciation; but I went hunting for relics\r\nand reminders of the Margravine Wilhelmina, she of the imperishable\r\n\"Memoirs.\" I am properly grateful to her for her (unconscious) satire\r\nupon monarchy and nobility, and therefore nothing which her hand touched\r\nor her eye looked upon is indifferent to me. I am her pilgrim; the rest\r\nof this multitude here are Wagner's.\r\n\r\nTUESDAY.--I have seen my last two operas; my season is ended, and we\r\ncross over into Bohemia this afternoon. I was supposing that my musical\r\nregeneration was accomplished and perfected, because I enjoyed both\r\nof these operas, singing and all, and, moreover, one of them was\r\n\"Parsifal,\" but the experts have disenchanted me. They say:\r\n\r\n\"Singing! That wasn't singing; that was the wailing, screeching of\r\nthird-rate obscurities, palmed off on us in the interest of economy.\"\r\n\r\nWell, I ought to have recognized the sign--the old, sure sign that has\r\nnever failed me in matters of art. Whenever I enjoy anything in art it\r\nmeans that it is mighty poor. The private knowledge of this fact has\r\nsaved me from going to pieces with enthusiasm in front of many and many\r\na chromo. However, my base instinct does bring me profit sometimes; I\r\nwas the only man out of thirty-two hundred who got his money back on\r\nthose two operas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it true that the sun of a man's mentality touches noon at forty and\r\nthen begins to wane toward setting? Doctor Osler is charged with saying\r\nso. Maybe he said it, maybe he didn't; I don't know which it is. But if\r\nhe said it, I can point him to a case which proves his rule. Proves it\r\nby being an exception to it. To this place I nominate Mr. Howells.\r\n\r\nI read his VENETIAN DAYS about forty years ago. I compare it with his\r\npaper on Machiavelli in a late number of HARPER, and I cannot find that\r\nhis English has suffered any impairment. For forty years his English\r\nhas been to me a continual delight and astonishment. In the sustained\r\nexhibition of certain great qualities--clearness, compression,\r\nverbal exactness, and unforced and seemingly unconscious felicity of\r\nphrasing--he is, in my belief, without his peer in the English-writing\r\nworld. SUSTAINED. I entrench myself behind that protecting word. There\r\nare others who exhibit those great qualities as greatly as he does, but\r\nonly by intervaled distributions of rich moonlight, with stretches\r\nof veiled and dimmer landscape between; whereas Howells's moon sails\r\ncloudless skies all night and all the nights.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of verbal exactness Mr. Howells has no superior, I\r\nsuppose. He seems to be almost always able to find that elusive and\r\nshifty grain of gold, the RIGHT WORD. Others have to put up with\r\napproximations, more or less frequently; he has better luck. To me, the\r\nothers are miners working with the gold-pan--of necessity some of the\r\ngold washes over and escapes; whereas, in my fancy, he is quicksilver\r\nraiding down a riffle--no grain of the metal stands much chance of\r\neluding him. A powerful agent is the right word: it lights the reader's\r\nway and makes it plain; a close approximation to it will answer, and\r\nmuch traveling is done in a well-enough fashion by its help, but we do\r\nnot welcome it and applaud it and rejoice in it as we do when THE right\r\none blazes out on us. Whenever we come upon one of those intensely right\r\nwords in a book or a newspaper the resulting effect is physical as well\r\nas spiritual, and electrically prompt: it tingles exquisitely around\r\nthrough the walls of the mouth and tastes as tart and crisp and good\r\nas the autumn-butter that creams the sumac-berry. One has no time to\r\nexamine the word and vote upon its rank and standing, the automatic\r\nrecognition of its supremacy is so immediate. There is a plenty of\r\nacceptable literature which deals largely in approximations, but it may\r\nbe likened to a fine landscape seen through the rain; the right word\r\nwould dismiss the rain, then you would see it better. It doesn't rain\r\nwhen Howells is at work.\r\n\r\nAnd where does he get the easy and effortless flow of his speech? and\r\nits cadenced and undulating rhythm? and its architectural felicities\r\nof construction, its graces of expression, its pemmican quality of\r\ncompression, and all that? Born to him, no doubt. All in shining good\r\norder in the beginning, all extraordinary; and all just as shining, just\r\nas extraordinary today, after forty years of diligent wear and tear\r\nand use. He passed his fortieth year long and long ago; but I think his\r\nEnglish of today--his perfect English, I wish to say--can throw down the\r\nglove before his English of that antique time and not be afraid.\r\n\r\nI will go back to the paper on Machiavelli now, and ask the reader to\r\nexamine this passage from it which I append. I do not mean examine it\r\nin a bird's-eye way; I mean search it, study it. And, of course, read it\r\naloud. I may be wrong, still it is my conviction that one cannot get out\r\nof finely wrought literature all that is in it by reading it mutely:\r\n\r\nMr. Dyer is rather of the opinion, first luminously suggested by\r\nMacaulay, that Machiavelli was in earnest, but must not be judged as a\r\npolitical moralist of our time and race would be judged. He thinks that\r\nMachiavelli was in earnest, as none but an idealist can be, and he\r\nis the first to imagine him an idealist immersed in realities, who\r\ninvoluntarily transmutes the events under his eye into something like\r\nthe visionary issues of reverie. The Machiavelli whom he depicts does\r\nnot cease to be politically a republican and socially a just man because\r\nhe holds up an atrocious despot like Caesar Borgia as a mirror for\r\nrulers. What Machiavelli beheld round him in Italy was a civic disorder\r\nin which there was oppression without statecraft, and revolt without\r\npatriotism. When a miscreant like Borgia appeared upon the scene and\r\nreduced both tyrants and rebels to an apparent quiescence, he might very\r\nwell seem to such a dreamer the savior of society whom a certain sort of\r\ndreamers are always looking for. Machiavelli was no less honest when he\r\nhonored the diabolical force of Caesar Borgia than Carlyle was when at different times\r\nhe extolled the strong man who destroys liberty in creating order. But\r\nCarlyle has only just ceased to be mistaken for a reformer, while it is\r\nstill Machiavelli's hard fate to be so trammeled in his material that\r\nhis name stands for whatever is most malevolent and perfidious in human\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nYou see how easy and flowing it is; how unvexed by ruggednesses,\r\nclumsinesses, broken meters; how simple and--so far as you or I can\r\nmake out--unstudied; how clear, how limpid, how understandable,\r\nhow unconfused by cross-currents, eddies, undertows; how seemingly\r\nunadorned, yet is all adornment, like the lily-of-the-valley; and how\r\ncompressed, how compact, without a complacency-signal hung out anywhere\r\nto call attention to it.\r\n\r\nThere are twenty-three lines in the quoted passage. After reading it\r\nseveral times aloud, one perceives that a good deal of matter is crowded\r\ninto that small space. I think it is a model of compactness. When I take\r\nits materials apart and work them over and put them together in my way,\r\nI find I cannot crowd the result back into the same hole, there not\r\nbeing room enough. I find it a case of a woman packing a man's trunk: he\r\ncan get the things out, but he can't ever get them back again.\r\n\r\nThe proffered paragraph is a just and fair sample; the rest of the\r\narticle is as compact as it is; there are no waste words. The sample is\r\njust in other ways: limpid, fluent, graceful, and rhythmical as it is,\r\nit holds no superiority in these respects over the rest of the essay.\r\nAlso, the choice phrasing noticeable in the sample is not lonely; there\r\nis a plenty of its kin distributed through the other paragraphs. This is\r\nclaiming much when that kin must face the challenge of a phrase like\r\nthe one in the middle sentence: \"an idealist immersed in realities who\r\ninvoluntarily transmutes the events under his eye into something like\r\nthe visionary issues of reverie.\" With a hundred words to do it with,\r\nthe literary artisan could catch that airy thought and tie it down and\r\nreduce it to a concrete condition, visible, substantial, understandable\r\nand all right, like a cabbage; but the artist does it with twenty, and\r\nthe result is a flower.\r\n\r\nThe quoted phrase, like a thousand others that have come from the same\r\nsource, has the quality of certain scraps of verse which take hold of\r\nus and stay in our memories, we do not understand why, at first: all the\r\nwords being the right words, none of them is conspicuous, and so they\r\nall seem inconspicuous, therefore we wonder what it is about them that\r\nmakes their message take hold.\r\n\r\n     The mossy marbles rest\r\n     On the lips that he has prest\r\n     In their bloom,\r\n     And the names he loved to hear\r\n     Have been carved for many a year\r\n     On the tomb.\r\n\r\n     --Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.\r\n\r\nIt is like a dreamy strain of moving music, with no sharp notes in it.\r\nThe words are all \"right\" words, and all the same size. We do not notice\r\nit at first. We get the effect, it goes straight home to us, but we\r\ndo not know why. It is when the right words are conspicuous that they\r\nthunder:\r\n\r\nThe glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome!\r\n\r\nWhen I go back from Howells old to Howells young I find him arranging\r\nand clustering English words well, but not any better than now. He\r\nis not more felicitous in concreting abstractions now than he was in\r\ntranslating, then, the visions of the eyes of flesh into words that\r\nreproduced their forms and colors:\r\n\r\nIn Venetian streets they give the fallen snow no rest. It is at once\r\nshoveled into the canals by hundreds of half-naked FACCHINI; and now in\r\nSt. Mark's Place the music of innumerable shovels smote upon my ear; and\r\nI saw the shivering legion of poverty as it engaged the elements in a\r\nstruggle for the possession of the Piazza. But the snow continued to\r\nfall, and through the twilight of the descending flakes all this toil\r\nand encounter looked like that weary kind of effort in dreams, when\r\nthe most determined industry seems only to renew the task. The lofty\r\ncrest of the bell-tower was hidden in the folds of falling snow, and\r\nI could no longer see the golden angel upon its summit. But looked\r\nat across the Piazza, the beautiful outline of St. Mark's Church was\r\nperfectly penciled in the air, and the shifting threads of the snowfall\r\nwere woven into a spell of novel enchantment around the structure that\r\nalways seemed to me too exquisite in its fantastic loveliness to be\r\nanything but the creation of magic. The tender snow had compassionated\r\nthe beautiful edifice for all the wrongs of time, and so hid the stains\r\nand ugliness of decay that it looked as if just from the hand of the\r\nbuilder--or, better said, just from the brain of the architect. There\r\nwas marvelous freshness in the colors of the mosaics in the great arches\r\nof the facade, and all that gracious harmony into which the temple\r\nrises, of marble scrolls and leafy exuberance airily supporting the\r\nstatues of the saints, was a hundred times etherealized by the purity\r\nand whiteness of the drifting flakes. The snow lay lightly on the golden\r\nglobes that tremble like peacocks-crests above the vast domes, and\r\nplumed them with softest white; it robed the saints in ermine; and it\r\ndanced over all its works, as if exulting in its beauty--beauty\r\nwhich filled me with subtle, selfish yearning to keep such evanescent\r\nloveliness for the little-while-longer of my whole life, and with\r\ndespair to think that even the poor lifeless shadow of it could never be\r\nfairly reflected in picture or poem.\r\n\r\nThrough the wavering snowfall, the Saint Theodore upon one of the\r\ngranite pillars of the Piazzetta did not show so grim as his wont is,\r\nand the winged lion on the other might have been a winged lamb, so\r\ngentle and mild he looked by the tender light of the storm. The towers\r\nof the island churches loomed faint and far away in the dimness; the\r\nsailors in the rigging of the ships that lay in the Basin wrought like\r\nphantoms among the shrouds; the gondolas stole in and out of the opaque\r\ndistance more noiselessly and dreamily than ever; and a silence, almost\r\npalpable, lay upon the mutest city in the world.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of Venice is there: of a city where Age and Decay, fagged\r\nwith distributing damage and repulsiveness among the other cities of the\r\nplanet in accordance with the policy and business of their profession,\r\ncome for rest and play between seasons, and treat themselves to the\r\nluxury and relaxation of sinking the shop and inventing and squandering\r\ncharms all about, instead of abolishing such as they find, as is their\r\nhabit when not on vacation.\r\n\r\nIn the working season they do business in Boston sometimes, and a\r\ncharacter in THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY takes accurate note of pathetic\r\neffects wrought by them upon the aspects of a street of once dignified\r\nand elegant homes whose occupants have moved away and left them a prey\r\nto neglect and gradual ruin and progressive degradation; a descent\r\nwhich reaches bottom at last, when the street becomes a roost for humble\r\nprofessionals of the faith-cure and fortune-telling sort.\r\n\r\nWhat a queer, melancholy house, what a queer, melancholy street! I don't\r\nthink I was ever in a street before where quite so many professional\r\nladies, with English surnames, preferred Madam to Mrs. on their\r\ndoor-plates. And the poor old place has such a desperately conscious\r\nair of going to the deuce. Every house seems to wince as you go by,\r\nand button itself up to the chin for fear you should find out it had\r\nno shirt on--so to speak. I don't know what's the reason, but these\r\nmaterial tokens of a social decay afflict me terribly; a tipsy woman\r\nisn't dreadfuler than a haggard old house, that's once been a home, in a\r\nstreet like this.\r\n\r\nMr. Howells's pictures are not mere stiff, hard, accurate photographs;\r\nthey are photographs with feeling in them, and sentiment, photographs\r\ntaken in a dream, one might say.\r\n\r\nAs concerns his humor, I will not try to say anything, yet I would try,\r\nif I had the words that might approximately reach up to its high place.\r\nI do not think any one else can play with humorous fancies so gracefully\r\nand delicately and deliciously as he does, nor has so many to play with,\r\nnor can come so near making them look as if they were doing the playing\r\nthemselves and he was not aware that they were at it. For they are\r\nunobtrusive, and quiet in their ways, and well conducted. His is a humor\r\nwhich flows softly all around about and over and through the mesh of the\r\npage, pervasive, refreshing, health-giving, and makes no more show and\r\nno more noise than does the circulation of the blood.\r\n\r\nThere is another thing which is contentingly noticeable in Mr. Howells's\r\nbooks. That is his \"stage directions\"--those artifices which authors\r\nemploy to throw a kind of human naturalness around a scene and a\r\nconversation, and help the reader to see the one and get at meanings in\r\nthe other which might not be perceived if entrusted unexplained to the\r\nbare words of the talk. Some authors overdo the stage directions, they\r\nelaborate them quite beyond necessity; they spend so much time and\r\ntake up so much room in telling us how a person said a thing and how he\r\nlooked and acted when he said it that we get tired and vexed and wish he\r\nhadn't said it at all. Other authors' directions are brief enough, but it\r\nis seldom that the brevity contains either wit or information. Writers\r\nof this school go in rags, in the matter of stage directions; the\r\nmajority of them having nothing in stock but a cigar, a laugh, a blush,\r\nand a bursting into tears. In their poverty they work these sorry things\r\nto the bone. They say:\r\n\r\n\"... replied Alfred, flipping the ash from his cigar.\" (This explains\r\nnothing; it only wastes space.)\r\n\r\n\"... responded Richard, with a laugh.\" (There was nothing to laugh\r\nabout; there never is. The writer puts it in from habit--automatically;\r\nhe is paying no attention to his work; or he would see that there is\r\nnothing to laugh at; often, when a remark is unusually and poignantly\r\nflat and silly, he tries to deceive the reader by enlarging the stage\r\ndirection and making Richard break into \"frenzies of uncontrollable\r\nlaughter.\" This makes the reader sad.)\r\n\r\n\"... murmured Gladys, blushing.\" (This poor old shop-worn blush is a\r\ntiresome thing. We get so we would rather Gladys would fall out of the\r\nbook and break her neck than do it again. She is always doing it, and\r\nusually irrelevantly. Whenever it is her turn to murmur she hangs out\r\nher blush; it is the only thing she's got. In a little while we hate\r\nher, just as we do Richard.)\r\n\r\n\"... repeated Evelyn, bursting into tears.\" (This kind keep a book damp\r\nall the time. They can't say a thing without crying. They cry so much\r\nabout nothing that by and by when they have something to cry ABOUT they\r\nhave gone dry; they sob, and fetch nothing; we are not moved. We are\r\nonly glad.)\r\n\r\nThey garvel me, these stale and overworked stage directions, these carbon\r\nfilms that got burnt out long ago and cannot now carry any faintest\r\nthread of light. It would be well if they could be relieved from duty\r\nand flung out in the literary back yard to rot and disappear along\r\nwith the discarded and forgotten \"steeds\" and \"halidomes\" and similar\r\nstage-properties once so dear to our grandfathers. But I am friendly to\r\nMr. Howells's stage directions; more friendly to them than to any one\r\nelse's, I think. They are done with a competent and discriminating art,\r\nand are faithful to the requirements of a stage direction's proper and\r\nlawful office, which is to inform. Sometimes they convey a scene and\r\nits conditions so well that I believe I could see the scene and get the\r\nspirit and meaning of the accompanying dialogue if some one would read\r\nmerely the stage directions to me and leave out the talk. For instance,\r\na scene like this, from THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY:\r\n\r\n\"... and she laid her arms with a beseeching gesture on her father's\r\nshoulder.\"\r\n\r\n\"... she answered, following his gesture with a glance.\"\r\n\r\n\"... she said, laughing nervously.\"\r\n\r\n\"... she asked, turning swiftly upon him that strange, searching\r\nglance.\"\r\n\r\n\"... she answered, vaguely.\"\r\n\r\n\"... she reluctantly admitted.\"\r\n\r\n\"... but her voice died wearily away, and she stood looking into his\r\nface with puzzled entreaty.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Howells does not repeat his forms, and does not need to; he can\r\ninvent fresh ones without limit. It is mainly the repetition over and\r\nover again, by the third-rates, of worn and commonplace and juiceless\r\nforms that makes their novels such a weariness and vexation to us, I\r\nthink. We do not mind one or two deliveries of their wares, but as we\r\nturn the pages over and keep on meeting them we presently get tired of\r\nthem and wish they would do other things for a change.\r\n\r\n\"... replied Alfred, flipping the ash from his cigar.\"\r\n\r\n\"... responded Richard, with a laugh.\"\r\n\r\n\"... murmured Gladys, blushing.\"\r\n\r\n\"... repeated Evelyn, bursting into tears.\"\r\n\r\n\"... replied the Earl, flipping the ash from his cigar.\"\r\n\r\n\"... responded the undertaker, with a laugh.\"\r\n\r\n\"... murmured the chambermaid, blushing.\"\r\n\r\n\"... repeated the burglar, bursting into tears.\"\r\n\r\n\"... replied the conductor, flipping the ash from his cigar.\"\r\n\r\n\"... responded Arkwright, with a laugh.\"\r\n\r\n\"... murmured the chief of police, blushing.\"\r\n\r\n\"... repeated the house-cat, bursting into tears.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so on and so on; till at last it ceases to excite. I always notice\r\nstage directions, because they fret me and keep me trying to get out\r\nof their way, just as the automobiles do. At first; then by and by they\r\nbecome monotonous and I get run over.\r\n\r\nMr. Howells has done much work, and the spirit of it is as beautiful\r\nas the make of it. I have held him in admiration and affection so many\r\nyears that I know by the number of those years that he is old now;\r\nbut his heart isn't, nor his pen; and years do not count. Let him have\r\nplenty of them; there is profit in them for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLISH AS SHE IS TAUGHT\r\n\r\nIn the appendix to Croker's Boswell's Johnson one finds this anecdote:\r\n\r\nCATO'S SOLILOQUY.--One day Mrs. Gastrel set a little girl to repeat to\r\nhim (Dr. Samuel Johnson) Cato's Soliloquy, which she went through very\r\ncorrectly. The Doctor, after a pause, asked the child:\r\n\r\n\"What was to bring Cato to an end?\"\r\n\r\nShe said it was a knife.\r\n\r\n\"No, my dear, it was not so.\"\r\n\r\n\"My aunt Polly said it was a knife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Aunt Polly's knife MAY DO, but it was a DAGGER, my dear.\"\r\n\r\nHe then asked her the meaning of \"bane and antidote,\" which she was\r\nunable to give. Mrs. Gastrel said:\r\n\r\n\"You cannot expect so young a child to know the meaning of such words.\"\r\n\r\nHe then said:\r\n\r\n\"My dear, how many pence are there in SIXPENCE?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell, sir,\" was the half-terrified reply.\r\n\r\nOn this, addressing himself to Mrs. Gastrel, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Now, my dear lady, can anything be more ridiculous than to teach a\r\nchild Cato's Soliloquy, who does not know how many pence there are in\r\nsixpence?\"\r\n\r\nIn a lecture before the Royal Geographical Society Professor Ravenstein\r\nquoted the following list of frantic questions, and said that they had\r\nbeen asked in an examination:\r\n\r\nMention all the names of places in the world derived from Julius Caesar or\r\nAugustus Caesar.\r\n\r\nWhere are the following rivers: Pisuerga, Sakaria, Guadalete, Jalon,\r\nMulde?\r\n\r\nAll you know of the following: Machacha, Pilmo, Schebulos, Crivoscia,\r\nBasecs, Mancikert, Taxhem, Citeaux, Meloria, Zutphen.\r\n\r\nThe highest peaks of the Karakorum range.\r\n\r\nThe number of universities in Prussia.\r\n\r\nWhy are the tops of mountains continually covered with snow (sic)?\r\n\r\nName the length and breadth of the streams of lava which issued from the\r\nSkaptar Jokul in the eruption of 1783.\r\n\r\nThat list would oversize nearly anybody's geographical knowledge. Isn't\r\nit reasonably possible that in our schools many of the questions in all\r\nstudies are several miles ahead of where the pupil is?--that he is set\r\nto struggle with things that are ludicrously beyond his present reach,\r\nhopelessly beyond his present strength? This remark in passing, and by\r\nway of text; now I come to what I was going to say.\r\n\r\nI have just now fallen upon a darling literary curiosity. It is a little\r\nbook, a manuscript compilation, and the compiler sent it to me with the\r\nrequest that I say whether I think it ought to be published or not. I\r\nsaid, Yes; but as I slowly grow wise I briskly grow cautious; and so,\r\nnow that the publication is imminent, it has seemed to me that I should\r\nfeel more comfortable if I could divide up this responsibility with the\r\npublic by adding them to the court. Therefore I will print some extracts\r\nfrom the book, in the hope that they may make converts to my judgment\r\nthat the volume has merit which entitles it to publication.\r\n\r\nAs to its character. Every one has sampled \"English as She is Spoke\"\r\nand \"English as She is Wrote\"; this little volume furnishes us an\r\ninstructive array of examples of \"English as She is Taught\"--in the\r\npublic schools of--well, this country. The collection is made by a\r\nteacher in those schools, and all the examples in it are genuine; none\r\nof them have been tampered with, or doctored in any way. From time to\r\ntime, during several years, whenever a pupil has delivered himself\r\nof anything peculiarly quaint or toothsome in the course of his\r\nrecitations, this teacher and her associates have privately set that\r\nthing down in a memorandum-book; strictly following the original, as\r\nto grammar, construction, spelling, and all; and the result is this\r\nliterary curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the book consist mainly of answers given by the boys\r\nand girls to questions, said answers being given sometimes verbally,\r\nsometimes in writing. The subjects touched upon are fifteen in\r\nnumber: I. Etymology; II. Grammar; III. Mathematics; IV. Geography;\r\nV. \"Original\"; VI. Analysis; VII. History; VIII. \"Intellectual\"; IX.\r\nPhilosophy; X. Physiology; XI. Astronomy; XII. Politics; XIII. Music;\r\nXIV. Oratory; XV. Metaphysics.\r\n\r\nYou perceive that the poor little young idea has taken a shot at a good\r\nmany kinds of game in the course of the book. Now as to results. Here\r\nare some quaint definitions of words. It will be noticed that in all of\r\nthese instances the sound of the word, or the look of it on paper, has\r\nmisled the child:\r\n\r\nABORIGINES, a system of mountains.\r\n\r\nALIAS, a good man in the Bible.\r\n\r\nAMENABLE, anything that is mean.\r\n\r\nAMMONIA, the food of the gods.\r\n\r\nASSIDUITY, state of being an acid.\r\n\r\nAURIFEROUS, pertaining to an orifice.\r\n\r\nCAPILLARY, a little caterpillar.\r\n\r\nCORNIFEROUS, rocks in which fossil corn is found.\r\n\r\nEMOLUMENT, a headstone to a grave.\r\n\r\nEQUESTRIAN, one who asks questions.\r\n\r\nEUCHARIST, one who plays euchre.\r\n\r\nFRANCHISE, anything belonging to the French.\r\n\r\nIDOLATER, a very idle person.\r\n\r\nIPECAC, a man who likes a good dinner.\r\n\r\nIRRIGATE, to make fun of.\r\n\r\nMENDACIOUS, what can be mended.\r\n\r\nMERCENARY, one who feels for another.\r\n\r\nPARASITE, a kind of umbrella.\r\n\r\nPARASITE, the murder of an infant.\r\n\r\nPUBLICAN, a man who does his prayers in public.\r\n\r\nTENACIOUS, ten acres of land.\r\n\r\nHere is one where the phrase \"publicans and sinners\" has got mixed up\r\nin the child's mind with politics, and the result is a definition which\r\ntakes one in a sudden and unexpected way:\r\n\r\nREPUBLICAN, a sinner mentioned in the Bible.\r\n\r\nAlso in Democratic newspapers now and then. Here are two where the\r\nmistake has resulted from sound assisted by remote fact:\r\n\r\nPLAGIARIST, a writer of plays.\r\n\r\nDEMAGOGUE, a vessel containing beer and other liquids.\r\n\r\nI cannot quite make out what it was that misled the pupil in the\r\nfollowing instances; it would not seem to have been the sound of the\r\nword, nor the look of it in print:\r\n\r\nASPHYXIA, a grumbling, fussy temper.\r\n\r\nQUARTERNIONS, a bird with a flat beak and no bill, living in New\r\nZealand.\r\n\r\nQUARTERNIONS, the name given to a style of art practiced by the\r\nPhoenicians.\r\n\r\nQUARTERNIONS, a religious convention held every hundred years.\r\n\r\nSIBILANT, the state of being idiotic.\r\n\r\nCROSIER, a staff carried by the Deity.\r\n\r\nIn the following sentences the pupil's ear has been deceiving him again:\r\n\r\nThe marriage was illegible.\r\n\r\nHe was totally dismasted with the whole performance.\r\n\r\nHe enjoys riding on a philosopher.\r\n\r\nShe was very quick at repertoire.\r\n\r\nHe prayed for the waters to subsidize.\r\n\r\nThe leopard is watching his sheep.\r\n\r\nThey had a strawberry vestibule.\r\n\r\nHere is one which--well, now, how often we do slam right into the truth\r\nwithout ever suspecting it:\r\n\r\nThe men employed by the Gas Company go around and speculate the meter.\r\n\r\nIndeed they do, dear; and when you grow up, many and many's the time you\r\nwill notice it in the gas bill. In the following sentences the little\r\npeople have some information to convey, every time; but in my case they\r\nfail to connect: the light always went out on the keystone word:\r\n\r\nThe coercion of some things is remarkable; as bread and molasses.\r\n\r\nHer hat is contiguous because she wears it on one side.\r\n\r\nHe preached to an egregious congregation.\r\n\r\nThe captain eliminated a bullet through the man's heart.\r\n\r\nYou should take caution and be precarious.\r\n\r\nThe supercilious girl acted with vicissitude when the perennial time\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nThe last is a curiously plausible sentence; one seems to know what it\r\nmeans, and yet he knows all the time that he doesn't. Here is an odd\r\n(but entirely proper) use of a word, and a most sudden descent from\r\na lofty philosophical altitude to a very practical and homely\r\nillustration:\r\n\r\nWe should endeavor to avoid extremes--like those of wasps and bees.\r\n\r\nAnd here--with \"zoological\" and \"geological\" in his mind, but not ready\r\nto his tongue--the small scholar has innocently gone and let out\r\na couple of secrets which ought never to have been divulged in any\r\ncircumstances:\r\n\r\nThere are a good many donkeys in theological gardens.\r\n\r\nSome of the best fossils are found in theological cabinets.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of \"Grammar\" the little scholars furnish the following\r\ninformation:\r\n\r\nGender is the distinguishing nouns without regard to sex.\r\n\r\nA verb is something to eat.\r\n\r\nAdverbs should always be used as adjectives and adjectives as adverbs.\r\n\r\nEvery sentence and name of God must begin with a caterpillar.\r\n\r\n\"Caterpillar\" is well enough, but capital letter would have been\r\nstricter. The following is a brave attempt at a solution, but it failed\r\nto liquify:\r\n\r\nWhen they are going to say some prose or poetry before they say the\r\npoetry or prose they must put a semicolon just after the introduction of\r\nthe prose or poetry.\r\n\r\nThe chapter on \"Mathematics\" is full of fruit. From it I take a few\r\nsamples--mainly in an unripe state:\r\n\r\nA straight line is any distance between two places.\r\n\r\nParallel lines are lines that can never meet until they run together.\r\n\r\nA circle is a round straight line with a hole in the middle.\r\n\r\nThings which are equal to each other are equal to anything else.\r\n\r\nTo find the number of square feet in a room you multiply the room by the\r\nnumber of the feet. The product is the result.\r\n\r\nRight you are. In the matter of geography this little book is\r\nunspeakably rich. The questions do not appear to have applied the\r\nmicroscope to the subject, as did those quoted by Professor Ravenstein;\r\nstill, they proved plenty difficult enough without that. These pupils\r\ndid not hunt with a microscope, they hunted with a shot-gun; this is\r\nshown by the crippled condition of the game they brought in:\r\n\r\nAmerica is divided into the Passiffic slope and the Mississippi valey.\r\n\r\nNorth America is separated by Spain.\r\n\r\nAmerica consists from north to south about five hundred miles.\r\n\r\nThe United States is quite a small country compared with some other\r\ncountrys, but is about as industrious.\r\n\r\nThe capital of the United States is Long Island.\r\n\r\nThe five seaports of the U.S. are Newfunlan and Sanfrancisco.\r\n\r\nThe principal products of the U.S. is earthquakes and volcanoes.\r\n\r\nThe Alaginnies are mountains in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe Rocky Mountains are on the western side of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nCape Hateras is a vast body of water surrounded by land and flowing into\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nMason and Dixon's line is the Equator.\r\n\r\nOne of the leading industries of the United States is mollasses,\r\nbook-covers, numbers, gas, teaching, lumber, manufacturers,\r\npaper-making, publishers, coal.\r\n\r\nIn Austria the principal occupation is gathering Austrich feathers.\r\n\r\nGibraltar is an island built on a rock.\r\n\r\nRussia is very cold and tyrannical.\r\n\r\nSicily is one of the Sandwich Islands.\r\n\r\nHindoostan flows through the Ganges and empties into the Mediterranean\r\nSea.\r\n\r\nIreland is called the Emigrant Isle because it is so beautiful and\r\ngreen.\r\n\r\nThe width of the different zones Europe lies in depend upon the\r\nsurrounding country.\r\n\r\nThe imports of a country are the things that are paid for, the exports\r\nare the things that are not.\r\n\r\nClimate lasts all the time and weather only a few days.\r\n\r\nThe two most famous volcanoes of Europe are Sodom and Gomorrah.\r\n\r\nThe chapter headed \"Analysis\" shows us that the pupils in our public\r\nschools are not merely loaded up with those showy facts about geography,\r\nmathematics, and so on, and left in that incomplete state; no, there's\r\nmachinery for clarifying and expanding their minds. They are required to\r\ntake poems and analyze them, dig out their common sense, reduce them\r\nto statistics, and reproduce them in a luminous prose translation which\r\nshall tell you at a glance what the poet was trying to get at. One\r\nsample will do. Here is a stanza from \"The Lady of the Lake,\" followed\r\nby the pupil's impressive explanation of it:\r\n\r\nAlone, but with unbated zeal, The horseman plied with scourge and steel;\r\nFor jaded now and spent with toil, Embossed with foam and dark with\r\nsoil, While every gasp with sobs he drew, The laboring stag strained\r\nfull in view.\r\n\r\nThe man who rode on the horse performed the whip and an instrument made\r\nof steel alone with strong ardor not diminishing, for, being tired from\r\nthe time passed with hard labor overworked with anger and ignorant\r\nwith weariness, while every breath for labor he drew with cries full of\r\nsorrow, the young deer made imperfect who worked hard filtered in sight.\r\n\r\nI see, now, that I never understood that poem before. I have had\r\nglimpses of its meaning, in moments when I was not as ignorant with\r\nweariness as usual, but this is the first time the whole spacious idea\r\nof it ever filtered in sight. If I were a public-school pupil I would\r\nput those other studies aside and stick to analysis; for, after all, it\r\nis the thing to spread your mind.\r\n\r\nWe come now to historical matters, historical remains, one might say. As\r\none turns the pages he is impressed with the depth to which one date has\r\nbeen driven into the American child's head--1492. The date is there, and\r\nit is there to stay. And it is always at hand, always deliverable at\r\na moment's notice. But the Fact that belongs with it? That is quite\r\nanother matter. Only the date itself is familiar and sure: its vast\r\nFact has failed of lodgment. It would appear that whenever you ask a\r\npublic-school pupil when a thing--anything, no matter what--happened,\r\nand he is in doubt, he always rips out his 1492. He applies it to\r\neverything, from the landing of the ark to the introduction of the\r\nhorse-car. Well, after all, it is our first date, and so it is right\r\nenough to honor it, and pay the public schools to teach our children to\r\nhonor it:\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington was born in 1492.\r\n\r\nWashington wrote the Declaration of Independence in 1492.\r\n\r\nSt. Bartholemew was massacred in 1492.\r\n\r\nThe Brittains were the Saxons who entered England in 1492 under Julius\r\nCaesar.\r\n\r\nThe earth is 1492 miles in circumference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo proceed with \"History\"\r\n\r\nChristopher Columbus was called the Father of his Country.\r\n\r\nQueen Isabella of Spain sold her watch and chain and other millinery so\r\nthat Columbus could discover America.\r\n\r\nThe Indian wars were very desecrating to the country.\r\n\r\nThe Indians pursued their warfare by hiding in the bushes and then\r\nscalping them.\r\n\r\nCaptain John Smith has been styled the father of his country. His life\r\nwas saved by his daughter Pochahantas.\r\n\r\nThe Puritans found an insane asylum in the wilds of America.\r\n\r\nThe Stamp Act was to make everybody stamp all materials so they should\r\nbe null and void.\r\n\r\nWashington died in Spain almost broken-hearted. His remains were taken\r\nto the cathedral in Havana.\r\n\r\nGorilla warfare was where men rode on gorillas.\r\n\r\nJohn Brown was a very good insane man who tried to get fugitives\r\nslaves into Virginia. He captured all the inhabitants, but was finally\r\nconquered and condemned to his death. The confederasy was formed by the\r\nfugitive slaves.\r\n\r\nAlfred the Great reigned 872 years. He was distinguished for letting\r\nsome buckwheat cakes burn, and the lady scolded him.\r\n\r\nHenry Eight was famous for being a great widower haveing lost several\r\nwives.\r\n\r\nLady Jane Grey studied Greek and Latin and was beheaded after a few\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nJohn Bright is noted for an incurable disease.\r\n\r\nLord James Gordon Bennet instigated the Gordon Riots.\r\n\r\nThe Middle Ages come in between antiquity and posterity.\r\n\r\nLuther introduced Christianity into England a good many thousand years\r\nago. His birthday was November 1883. He was once a Pope. He lived at the\r\ntime of the Rebellion of Worms.\r\n\r\nJulius Caesar is noted for his famous telegram dispatch I came I saw I\r\nconquered.\r\n\r\nJulius Caesar was really a very great man. He was a very great soldier\r\nand wrote a book for beginners in the Latin.\r\n\r\nCleopatra was caused by the death of an asp which she dissolved in a\r\nwine cup.\r\n\r\nThe only form of government in Greece was a limited monkey.\r\n\r\nThe Persian war lasted about 500 years.\r\n\r\nGreece had only 7 wise men.\r\n\r\nSocrates... destroyed some statues and had to drink Shamrock.\r\n\r\nHere is a fact correctly stated; and yet it is phrased with\r\nsuch ingenious infelicity that it can be depended upon to convey\r\nmisinformation every time it is uncarefully read:\r\n\r\nBy the Salic law no woman or descendant of a woman could occupy the\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nTo show how far a child can travel in history with judicious and\r\ndiligent boosting in the public school, we select the following mosaic:\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln was born in Wales in 1599.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter headed \"Intellectual\" I find a great number of most\r\ninteresting statements. A sample or two may be found not amiss:\r\n\r\nBracebridge Hall was written by Henry Irving.\r\n\r\nSnow Bound was written by Peter Cooper.\r\n\r\nThe House of the Seven Gables was written by Lord Bryant.\r\n\r\nEdgar A. Poe was a very curdling writer.\r\n\r\nCotton Mather was a writer who invented the cotten gin and wrote\r\nhistories.\r\n\r\nBeowulf wrote the Scriptures.\r\n\r\nBen Johnson survived Shakspeare in some respects.\r\n\r\nIn the Canterbury Tale it gives account of King Alfred on his way to the\r\nshrine of Thomas Bucket.\r\n\r\nChaucer was the father of English pottery.\r\n\r\nChaucer was a bland verse writer of the third century.\r\n\r\nChaucer was succeeded by H. Wads. Longfellow an American Writer. His\r\nwritings were chiefly prose and nearly one hundred years elapsed.\r\n\r\nShakspere translated the Scriptures and it was called St. James because\r\nhe did it.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the chapter I find many pages of information concerning\r\nShakespeare's plays, Milton's works, and those of Bacon, Addison, Samuel\r\nJohnson, Fielding, Richardson, Sterne, Smollett, De Foe, Locke, Pope,\r\nSwift, Goldsmith, Burns, Cowper, Wordsworth, Gibbon, Byron, Coleridge,\r\nHood, Scott, Macaulay, George Eliot, Dickens, Bulwer, Thackeray,\r\nBrowning, Mrs. Browning, Tennyson, and Disraeli--a fact which shows that\r\ninto the restricted stomach of the public-school pupil is shoveled every\r\nyear the blood, bone, and viscera of a gigantic literature, and the\r\nsame is there digested and disposed of in a most successful and\r\ncharacteristic and gratifying public-school way. I have space for but a\r\ntrifling few of the results:\r\n\r\nLord Byron was the son of an heiress and a drunken man.\r\n\r\nWm. Wordsworth wrote the Barefoot Boy and Imitations on Immortality.\r\n\r\nGibbon wrote a history of his travels in Italy. This was original.\r\n\r\nGeorge Eliot left a wife and children who mourned greatly for his\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nGeorge Eliot Miss Mary Evans Mrs. Cross Mrs. Lewis was the greatest\r\nfemale poet unless George Sands is made an exception of.\r\n\r\nBulwell is considered a good writer.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Scott Charles Bronte Alfred the Great and Johnson were the\r\nfirst great novelists.\r\n\r\nThomas Babington Makorlay graduated at Harvard and then studied law, he\r\nwas raised to the peerage as baron in 1557 and died in 1776.\r\n\r\nHere are two or three miscellaneous facts that may be of value, if taken\r\nin moderation:\r\n\r\nHomer's writings are Homer's Essays Virgil the Aenid and Paradise\r\nlost some people say that these poems were not written by Homer but by\r\nanother man of the same name.\r\n\r\nA sort of sadness kind of shone in Bryant's poems.\r\n\r\nHolmes is a very profligate and amusing writer.\r\n\r\nWhen the public-school pupil wrestles with the political features of the\r\nGreat Republic, they throw him sometimes:\r\n\r\nA bill becomes a law when the President vetoes it.\r\n\r\nThe three departments of the government is the President rules the\r\nworld, the governor rules the State, the mayor rules the city.\r\n\r\nThe first conscientious Congress met in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States was established to ensure domestic\r\nhostility.\r\n\r\nTruth crushed to earth will rise again. As follows:\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States is that part of the book at the\r\nend which nobody reads.\r\n\r\nAnd here she rises once more and untimely. There should be a limit to\r\npublic-school instruction; it cannot be wise or well to let the young\r\nfind out everything:\r\n\r\nCongress is divided into civilized half civilized and savage.\r\n\r\nHere are some results of study in music and oratory:\r\n\r\nAn interval in music is the distance on the keyboard from one piano to\r\nthe next.\r\n\r\nA rest means you are not to sing it.\r\n\r\nEmphasis is putting more distress on one word than another.\r\n\r\nThe chapter on \"Physiology\" contains much that ought not to be lost to\r\nscience:\r\n\r\nPhysillogigy is to study about your bones stummick and vertebry.\r\n\r\nOccupations which are injurious to health are cabolic acid gas which is\r\nimpure blood.\r\n\r\nWe have an upper and lower skin. The lower skin moves all the time and\r\nthe upper skin moves when we do.\r\n\r\nThe body is mostly composed of water and about one half is avaricious\r\ntissue.\r\n\r\nThe stomach is a small pear-shaped bone situated in the body.\r\n\r\nThe gastric juice keeps the bones from creaking.\r\n\r\nThe Chyle flows up the middle of the backbone and reaches the heart\r\nwhere it meets the oxygen and is purified.\r\n\r\nThe salivary glands are used to salivate the body.\r\n\r\nIn the stomach starch is changed to cane sugar and cane sugar to sugar\r\ncane.\r\n\r\nThe olfactory nerve enters the cavity of the orbit and is developed into\r\nthe special sense of hearing.\r\n\r\nThe growth of a tooth begins in the back of the mouth and extends to the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nIf we were on a railroad track and a train was coming the train would\r\ndeafen our ears so that we couldn't see to get off the track.\r\n\r\nIf, up to this point, none of my quotations have added flavor to the\r\nJohnsonian anecdote at the head of this article, let us make another\r\nattempt:\r\n\r\nThe theory that intuitive truths are discovered by the light of nature\r\noriginated from St. John's interpretation of a passage in the Gospel of\r\nPlato.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the earth is found by comparing a mass of known lead with\r\nthat of a mass of unknown lead.\r\n\r\nTo find the weight of the earth take the length of a degree on a\r\nmeridian and multiply by 62 1/2 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe spheres are to each other as the squares of their homologous sides.\r\n\r\nA body will go just as far in the first second as the body will go plus\r\nthe force of gravity and that's equal to twice what the body will go.\r\n\r\nSpecific gravity is the weight to be compared weight of an equal volume\r\nof or that is the weight of a body compared with the weight of an equal\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\nThe law of fluid pressure divide the different forms of organized bodies\r\nby the form of attraction and the number increased will be the form.\r\n\r\nInertia is that property of bodies by virtue of which it cannot change\r\nits own condition of rest or motion. In other words it is the negative\r\nquality of passiveness either in recoverable latency or insipient\r\nlatescence.\r\n\r\nIf a laugh is fair here, not the struggling child, nor the unintelligent\r\nteacher--or rather the unintelligent Boards, Committees, and\r\nTrustees--are the proper target for it. All through this little book one\r\ndetects the signs of a certain probable fact--that a large part of the\r\npupil's \"instruction\" consists in cramming him with obscure and wordy\r\n\"rules\" which he does not understand and has no time to understand. It\r\nwould be as useful to cram him with brickbats; they would at least stay.\r\nIn a town in the interior of New York, a few years ago, a gentleman\r\nset forth a mathematical problem and proposed to give a prize to every\r\npublic-school pupil who should furnish the correct solution of it.\r\nTwenty-two of the brightest boys in the public schools entered the\r\ncontest. The problem was not a very difficult one for pupils of their\r\nmathematical rank and standing, yet they all failed--by a hair--through\r\none trifling mistake or another. Some searching questions were asked,\r\nwhen it turned out that these lads were as glib as parrots with the\r\n\"rules,\" but could not reason out a single rule or explain the\r\nprinciple underlying it. Their memories had been stocked, but not their\r\nunderstandings. It was a case of brickbat culture, pure and simple.\r\n\r\nThere are several curious \"compositions\" in the little book, and we\r\nmust make room for one. It is full of naivete, brutal truth, and\r\nunembarrassed directness, and is the funniest (genuine) boy's\r\ncomposition I think I have ever seen:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON GIRLS\r\n\r\nGirls are very stuck up and dignefied in their maner and be have your.\r\nThey think more of dress than anything and like to play with dowls and\r\nrags. They cry if they see a cow in a far distance and are afraid of\r\nguns. They stay at home all the time and go to church on Sunday. They\r\nare al-ways sick. They are always funy and making fun of boy's hands\r\nand they say how dirty. They cant play marbels. I pity them poor things.\r\nThey make fun of boys and then turn round and love them. I dont beleave\r\nthey ever kiled a cat or anything. They look out every nite and say oh\r\nant the moon lovely. Thir is one thing I have not told and that is they\r\nal-ways now their lessons bettern boys.\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Edward Channing's recent article in SCIENCE:\r\n\r\nThe marked difference between the books now being produced by French,\r\nEnglish, and American travelers, on the one hand, and German explorers,\r\non the other, is too great to escape attention. That difference is due\r\nentirely to the fact that in school and university the German is taught,\r\nin the first place to see, and in the second place to understand what he\r\ndoes see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SIMPLIFIED ALPHABET\r\n\r\n(This article, written during the autumn of 1899, was about the last\r\nwriting done by Mark Twain on any impersonal subject.)\r\n\r\nI have had a kindly feeling, a friendly feeling, a cousinly feeling\r\ntoward Simplified Spelling, from the beginning of the movement three\r\nyears ago, but nothing more inflamed than that. It seemed to me to\r\nmerely propose to substitute one inadequacy for another; a sort of\r\npatching and plugging poor old dental relics with cement and gold and\r\nporcelain paste; what was really wanted was a new set of teeth. That is\r\nto say, a new ALPHABET.\r\n\r\nThe heart of our trouble is with our foolish alphabet. It doesn't\r\nknow how to spell, and can't be taught. In this it is like all other\r\nalphabets except one--the phonographic. That is the only competent\r\nalphabet in the world. It can spell and correctly pronounce any word in\r\nour language.\r\n\r\nThat admirable alphabet, that brilliant alphabet, that inspired\r\nalphabet, can be learned in an hour or two. In a week the student\r\ncan learn to write it with some little facility, and to read it with\r\nconsiderable ease. I know, for I saw it tried in a public school in\r\nNevada forty-five years ago, and was so impressed by the incident that\r\nit has remained in my memory ever since.\r\n\r\nI wish we could adopt it in place of our present written (and printed)\r\ncharacter. I mean SIMPLY the alphabet; simply the consonants and the\r\nvowels--I don't mean any REDUCTIONS or abbreviations of them, such as\r\nthe shorthand writer uses in order to get compression and speed. No, I\r\nwould SPELL EVERY WORD OUT.\r\n\r\nI will insert the alphabet here as I find it in Burnz's PHONIC\r\nSHORTHAND. (Figure 1) It is arranged on the basis of Isaac Pitman's\r\nPHONOGRAPHY. Isaac Pitman was the originator and father of scientific\r\nphonography. It is used throughout the globe. It was a memorable\r\ninvention. He made it public seventy-three years ago. The firm of Isaac\r\nPitman & Sons, New York, still exists, and they continue the master's\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nWhat should we gain?\r\n\r\nFirst of all, we could spell DEFINITELY--and correctly--any word you\r\nplease, just by the SOUND of it. We can't do that with our present\r\nalphabet. For instance, take a simple, every-day word PHTHISIS. If we\r\ntried to spell it by the sound of it, we should make it TYSIS, and be\r\nlaughed at by every educated person.\r\n\r\nSecondly, we should gain in REDUCTION OF LABOR in writing.\r\n\r\nSimplified Spelling makes valuable reductions in the case of several\r\nhundred words, but the new spelling must be LEARNED. You can't spell\r\nthem by the sound; you must get them out of the book.\r\n\r\nBut even if we knew the simplified form for every word in the language,\r\nthe phonographic alphabet would still beat the Simplified Speller \"hands\r\ndown\" in the important matter of economy of labor. I will illustrate:\r\n\r\nPRESENT FORM: through, laugh, highland.\r\n\r\nSIMPLIFIED FORM: thru, laff, hyland.\r\n\r\nPHONOGRAPHIC FORM: (Figure 2)\r\n\r\nTo write the word \"through,\" the pen has to make twenty-one strokes.\r\n\r\nTo write the word \"thru,\" the pen has to make twelve strokes--a good\r\nsaving.\r\n\r\nTo write that same word with the phonographic alphabet, the pen has to\r\nmake only THREE strokes.\r\n\r\nTo write the word \"laugh,\" the pen has to make FOURTEEN strokes.\r\n\r\nTo write \"laff,\" the pen has to make the SAME NUMBER of strokes--no\r\nlabor is saved to the penman.\r\n\r\nTo write the same word with the phonographic alphabet, the pen has to\r\nmake only THREE strokes.\r\n\r\nTo write the word \"highland,\" the pen has to make twenty-two strokes.\r\n\r\nTo write \"hyland,\" the pen has to make eighteen strokes.\r\n\r\nTo write that word with the phonographic alphabet, the pen has to make\r\nonly FIVE strokes. (Figure 3)\r\n\r\nTo write the words \"phonographic alphabet,\" the pen has to make\r\nfifty-three strokes.\r\n\r\nTo write \"fonografic alfabet,\" the pen has to make fifty strokes. To the\r\npenman, the saving in labor is insignificant.\r\n\r\nTo write that word (with vowels) with the phonographic alphabet, the pen\r\nhas to make only SEVENTEEN strokes.\r\n\r\nWithout the vowels, only THIRTEEN strokes. (Figure 4) The vowels are\r\nhardly necessary, this time.\r\n\r\nWe make five pen-strokes in writing an m. Thus: (Figure 5) a stroke\r\ndown; a stroke up; a second stroke down; a second stroke up; a final\r\nstroke down. Total, five. The phonographic alphabet accomplishes the\r\nm with a single stroke--a curve, like a parenthesis that has come home\r\ndrunk and has fallen face down right at the front door where everybody\r\nthat goes along will see him and say, Alas!\r\n\r\nWhen our written m is not the end of a word, but is otherwise located,\r\nit has to be connected with the next letter, and that requires another\r\npen-stroke, making six in all, before you get rid of that m. But never\r\nmind about the connecting strokes--let them go. Without counting them,\r\nthe twenty-six letters of our alphabet consumed about eighty pen-strokes\r\nfor their construction--about three pen-strokes per letter.\r\n\r\nIt is THREE TIMES THE NUMBER required by the phonographic alphabet. It\r\nrequires but ONE stroke for each letter.\r\n\r\nMy writing-gait is--well, I don't know what it is, but I will time\r\nmyself and see. Result: it is twenty-four words per minute. I don't mean\r\ncomposing; I mean COPYING. There isn't any definite composing-gait.\r\n\r\nVery well, my copying-gait is 1,440 words per hour--say 1,500. If I\r\ncould use the phonographic character with facility I could do the 1,500\r\nin twenty minutes. I could do nine hours' copying in three hours; I\r\ncould do three years' copying in one year. Also, if I had a typewriting\r\nmachine with the phonographic alphabet on it--oh, the miracles I could\r\ndo!\r\n\r\nI am not pretending to write that character well. I have never had a\r\nlesson, and I am copying the letters from the book. But I can accomplish\r\nmy desire, at any rate, which is, to make the reader get a good and\r\nclear idea of the advantage it would be to us if we could discard our\r\npresent alphabet and put this better one in its place--using it in\r\nbooks, newspapers, with the typewriter, and with the pen.\r\n\r\n(Figure 6)--MAN DOG HORSE. I think it is graceful and would look comely\r\nin print. And consider--once more, I beg--what a labor-saver it is! Ten\r\npen-strokes with the one system to convey those three words above, and\r\nthirty-three by the other! (Figure 7) I mean, in SOME ways, not in all.\r\nI suppose I might go so far as to say in most ways, and be within the\r\nfacts, but never mind; let it go at SOME. One of the ways in which\r\nit exercises this birthright is--as I think--continuing to use our\r\nlaughable alphabet these seventy-three years while there was a rational\r\none at hand, to be had for the taking.\r\n\r\nIt has taken five hundred years to simplify some of Chaucer's rotten\r\nspelling--if I may be allowed to use so frank a term as that--and it\r\nwill take five hundred more to get our exasperating new Simplified\r\nCorruptions accepted and running smoothly. And we sha'n't be any better\r\noff then than we are now; for in that day we shall still have the\r\nprivilege the Simplifiers are exercising now: ANYBODY can change the\r\nspelling that wants to.\r\n\r\nBUT YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE PHONOGRAPHIC SPELLING; THERE ISN'T ANY WAY. It\r\nwill always follow the SOUND. If you want to change the spelling, you\r\nhave to change the sound first.\r\n\r\nMind, I myself am a Simplified Speller; I belong to that unhappy\r\nguild that is patiently and hopefully trying to reform our drunken old\r\nalphabet by reducing his whiskey. Well, it will improve him. When they\r\nget through and have reformed him all they can by their system he will\r\nbe only HALF drunk. Above that condition their system can never lift\r\nhim. There is no competent, and lasting, and real reform for him but\r\nto take away his whiskey entirely, and fill up his jug with Pitman's\r\nwholesome and undiseased alphabet.\r\n\r\nOne great drawback to Simplified Spelling is, that in print a simplified\r\nword looks so like the very nation! and when you bunch a whole squadron\r\nof the Simplified together the spectacle is very nearly unendurable.\r\n\r\nThe da ma ov koars kum when the publik ma be expektd to get rekonsyled\r\nto the bezair asspekt of the Simplified Kombynashuns, but--if I may be\r\nallowed the expression--is it worth the wasted time? (Figure 8)\r\n\r\nTo see our letters put together in ways to which we are not accustomed\r\noffends the eye, and also takes the EXPRESSION out of the words.\r\n\r\nLa on, Makduf, and damd be he hoo furst krys hold, enuf!\r\n\r\nIt doesn't thrill you as it used to do. The simplifications have sucked\r\nthe thrill all out of it.\r\n\r\nBut a written character with which we are NOT ACQUAINTED does not\r\noffend us--Greek, Hebrew, Russian, Arabic, and the others--they have an\r\ninteresting look, and we see beauty in them, too. And this is true of\r\nhieroglyphics, as well. There is something pleasant and engaging about\r\nthe mathematical signs when we do not understand them. The mystery\r\nhidden in these things has a fascination for us: we can't come across a\r\nprinted page of shorthand without being impressed by it and wishing we\r\ncould read it.\r\n\r\nVery well, what I am offering for acceptance and adoption is not\r\nshorthand, but longhand, written with the SHORTHAND ALPHABET UNREDUCED.\r\nYou can write three times as many words in a minute with it as you can\r\nwrite with our alphabet. And so, in a way, it IS properly a shorthand.\r\nIt has a pleasant look, too; a beguiling look, an inviting look. I will\r\nwrite something in it, in my rude and untaught way: (Figure 9)\r\n\r\nEven when _I_ do it it comes out prettier than it does in Simplified\r\nSpelling. Yes, and in the Simplified it costs one hundred and\r\ntwenty-three pen-strokes to write it, whereas in the phonographic it\r\ncosts only twenty-nine.\r\n\r\n(Figure 9) is probably (Figure 10).\r\n\r\nLet us hope so, anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAS CONCERNS INTERPRETING THE DEITY\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThis line of hieroglyphs was for fourteen years the despair of all the\r\nscholars who labored over the mysteries of the Rosetta stone: (Figure 1)\r\n\r\nAfter five years of study Champollion translated it thus:\r\n\r\nTherefore let the worship of Epiphanes be maintained in all the temples,\r\nthis upon pain of death.\r\n\r\nThat was the twenty-fourth translation that had been furnished by\r\nscholars. For a time it stood. But only for a time. Then doubts began to\r\nassail it and undermine it, and the scholars resumed their labors. Three\r\nyears of patient work produced eleven new translations; among them,\r\nthis, by Grunfeldt, was received with considerable favor:\r\n\r\nThe horse of Epiphanes shall be maintained at the public expense; this\r\nupon pain of death.\r\n\r\nBut the following rendering, by Gospodin, was received by the learned\r\nworld with yet greater favor:\r\n\r\nThe priest shall explain the wisdom of Epiphanes to all these people,\r\nand these shall listen with reverence, upon pain of death.\r\n\r\nSeven years followed, in which twenty-one fresh and widely varying\r\nrenderings were scored--none of them quite convincing. But now, at last,\r\ncame Rawlinson, the youngest of all the scholars, with a translation\r\nwhich was immediately and universally recognized as being the correct\r\nversion, and his name became famous in a day. So famous, indeed, that\r\neven the children were familiar with it; and such a noise did the\r\nachievement itself make that not even the noise of the monumental\r\npolitical event of that same year--the flight from Elba--was able to\r\nsmother it to silence. Rawlinson's version reads as follows:\r\n\r\nTherefore, walk not away from the wisdom of Epiphanes, but turn and\r\nfollow it; so shall it conduct thee to the temple's peace, and soften\r\nfor thee the sorrows of life and the pains of death.\r\n\r\nHere is another difficult text: (Figure 2)\r\n\r\nIt is demotic--a style of Egyptian writing and a phase of the language\r\nwhich had perished from the knowledge of all men twenty-five hundred\r\nyears before the Christian era.\r\n\r\nOur red Indians have left many records, in the form of pictures, upon\r\nour crags and boulders. It has taken our most gifted and painstaking\r\nstudents two centuries to get at the meanings hidden in these pictures;\r\nyet there are still two little lines of hieroglyphics among the\r\nfigures grouped upon the Dighton Rocks which they have not succeeded in\r\ninterpreting to their satisfaction. These: (Figure 3)\r\n\r\nThe suggested solutions of this riddle are practically innumerable;\r\nthey would fill a book.\r\n\r\nThus we have infinite trouble in solving man-made mysteries; it is only\r\nwhen we set out to discover the secret of God that our difficulties\r\ndisappear. It was always so. In antique Roman times it was the custom of\r\nthe Deity to try to conceal His intentions in the entrails of birds,\r\nand this was patiently and hopefully continued century after century,\r\nalthough the attempted concealment never succeeded, in a single recorded\r\ninstance. The augurs could read entrails as easily as a modern child\r\ncan read coarse print. Roman history is full of the marvels of\r\ninterpretation which these extraordinary men performed. These strange\r\nand wonderful achievements move our awe and compel our admiration.\r\nThose men could pierce to the marrow of a mystery instantly. If the\r\nRosetta-stone idea had been introduced it would have defeated them,\r\nbut entrails had no embarrassments for them. Entrails have gone out,\r\nnow--entrails and dreams. It was at last found out that as hiding-places\r\nfor the divine intentions they were inadequate.\r\n\r\nA part of the wall of Valletri having in former times been struck with thunder,\r\nthe response of the soothsayers was, that a native of that town would\r\nsome time or other arrive at supreme power. --BOHN'S SUETONIUS, p. 138.\r\n\r\n\"Some time or other.\" It looks indefinite, but no matter, it happened,\r\nall the same; one needed only to wait, and be patient, and keep watch,\r\nthen he would find out that the thunder-stroke had Caesar Augustus in\r\nmind, and had come to give notice.\r\n\r\nThere were other advance-advertisements. One of them appeared just\r\nbefore Caesar Augustus was born, and was most poetic and touching and\r\nromantic in its feelings and aspects. It was a dream. It was dreamed by\r\nCaesar Augustus's mother, and interpreted at the usual rates:\r\n\r\nAtia, before her delivery, dreamed that her bowels stretched to\r\nthe stars and expanded through the whole circuit of heaven and\r\nearth.--SUETONIUS, p. 139.\r\n\r\nThat was in the augur's line, and furnished him no difficulties, but it\r\nwould have taken Rawlinson and Champollion fourteen years to make sure\r\nof what it meant, because they would have been surprised and dizzy. It\r\nwould have been too late to be valuable, then, and the bill for service\r\nwould have been barred by the statute of limitation.\r\n\r\nIn those old Roman days a gentleman's education was not complete until\r\nhe had taken a theological course at the seminary and learned how to\r\ntranslate entrails. Caesar Augustus's education received this final\r\npolish. All through his life, whenever he had poultry on the menu he\r\nsaved the interiors and kept himself informed of the Deity's plans by\r\nexercising upon those interiors the arts of augury.\r\n\r\nIn his first consulship, while he was observing the auguries, twelve\r\nvultures presented themselves, as they had done to Romulus. And when he\r\noffered sacrifice, the livers of all the victims were folded inward in\r\nthe lower part; a circumstance which was regarded by those present who\r\nhad skill in things of that nature, as an indubitable prognostic of\r\ngreat and wonderful fortune.--SUETONIUS, p. 141.\r\n\r\n\"Indubitable\" is a strong word, but no doubt it was justified, if the\r\nlivers were really turned that way. In those days chicken livers were\r\nstrangely and delicately sensitive to coming events, no matter how far\r\noff they might be; and they could never keep still, but would curl and\r\nsquirm like that, particularly when vultures came and showed interest in\r\nthat approaching great event and in breakfast.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWe may now skip eleven hundred and thirty or forty years, which brings\r\nus down to enlightened Christian times and the troubled days of King\r\nStephen of England. The augur has had his day and has been long ago\r\nforgotten; the priest had fallen heir to his trade.\r\n\r\nKing Henry is dead; Stephen, that bold and outrageous person, comes\r\nflying over from Normandy to steal the throne from Henry's daughter.\r\nHe accomplished his crime, and Henry of Huntington, a priest of high\r\ndegree, mourns over it in his Chronicle. The Archbishop of Canterbury\r\nconsecrated Stephen: \"wherefore the Lord visited the Archbishop with the\r\nsame judgment which he had inflicted upon him who struck Jeremiah the\r\ngreat priest: he died within a year.\"\r\n\r\nStephen's was the greater offense, but Stephen could wait; not so the\r\nArchbishop, apparently.\r\n\r\nThe kingdom was a prey to intestine wars; slaughter, fire, and rapine\r\nspread ruin throughout the land; cries of distress, horror, and woe rose\r\nin every quarter.\r\n\r\nThat was the result of Stephen's crime. These unspeakable conditions\r\ncontinued during nineteen years. Then Stephen died as comfortably as\r\nany man ever did, and was honorably buried. It makes one pity the poor\r\nArchbishop, and wish that he, too, could have been let off as leniently.\r\nHow did Henry of Huntington know that the Archbishop was sent to his\r\ngrave by judgment of God for consecrating Stephen? He does not explain.\r\nNeither does he explain why Stephen was awarded a pleasanter death than\r\nhe was entitled to, while the aged King Henry, his predecessor, who\r\nhad ruled England thirty-five years to the people's strongly worded\r\nsatisfaction, was condemned to close his life in circumstances most\r\ndistinctly unpleasant, inconvenient, and disagreeable. His was probably\r\nthe most uninspiring funeral that is set down in history. There is not\r\na detail about it that is attractive. It seems to have been just the\r\nfuneral for Stephen, and even at this far-distant day it is matter of\r\njust regret that by an indiscretion the wrong man got it.\r\n\r\nWhenever God punishes a man, Henry of Huntington knows why it was done,\r\nand tells us; and his pen is eloquent with admiration; but when a man\r\nhas earned punishment, and escapes, he does not explain. He is evidently\r\npuzzled, but he does not say anything. I think it is often apparent that\r\nhe is pained by these discrepancies, but loyally tries his best not\r\nto show it. When he cannot praise, he delivers himself of a silence\r\nso marked that a suspicious person could mistake it for suppressed\r\ncriticism. However, he has plenty of opportunities to feel contented\r\nwith the way things go--his book is full of them.\r\n\r\n  King David of Scotland... under color of religion caused his followers\r\n  to deal most barbarously with the English. They ripped open women,\r\n  tossed children on the points of spears, butchered priests at the\r\n  altars, and, cutting off the heads from the images on crucifixes, placed\r\n  them on the bodies of the slain, while in exchange they fixed on the\r\n  crucifixes the heads of their victims. Wherever the Scots came, there\r\n  was the same scene of horror and cruelty: women shrieking, old men\r\n  lamenting, amid the groans of the dying and the despair of the living.\r\n\r\nBut the English got the victory.\r\n\r\n  Then the chief of the men of Lothian fell, pierced by an arrow, and all\r\n  his followers were put to flight. For the Almighty was offended at them\r\n  and their strength was rent like a cobweb.\r\n\r\nOffended at them for what? For committing those fearful butcheries? No,\r\nfor that was the common custom on both sides, and not open to criticism.\r\nThen was it for doing the butcheries \"under cover of religion\"? No, that\r\nwas not it; religious feeling was often expressed in that fervent way\r\nall through those old centuries. The truth is, He was not offended at\r\n\"them\" at all; He was only offended at their king, who had been false to\r\nan oath. Then why did not He put the punishment upon the king instead\r\nof upon \"them\"? It is a difficult question. One can see by the Chronicle\r\nthat the \"judgments\" fell rather customarily upon the wrong person, but\r\nHenry of Huntington does not explain why. Here is one that went true;\r\nthe chronicler's satisfaction in it is not hidden:\r\n\r\n  In the month of August, Providence displayed its justice in a remarkable\r\n  manner; for two of the nobles who had converted monasteries into\r\n  fortifications, expelling the monks, their sin being the same, met with\r\n  a similar punishment. Robert Marmion was one, Godfrey de Mandeville the\r\n  other. Robert Marmion, issuing forth against the enemy, was slain under\r\n  the walls of the monastery, being the only one who fell, though he was\r\n  surrounded by his troops. Dying excommunicated, he became subject to\r\n  death everlasting. In like manner Earl Godfrey was singled out among\r\n  his followers, and shot with an arrow by a common foot-soldier. He\r\n  made light of the wound, but he died of it in a few days, under\r\n  excommunication. See here the like judgment of God, memorable through\r\n  all ages!\r\n\r\nThis exaltation jars upon me; not because of the death of the men, for\r\nthey deserved that, but because it is death eternal, in white-hot fire\r\nand flame. It makes my flesh crawl. I have not known more than three\r\nmen, or perhaps four, in my whole lifetime, whom I would rejoice to see\r\nwrithing in those fires for even a year, let alone forever. I believe\r\nI would relent before the year was up, and get them out if I could.\r\nI think that in the long run, if a man's wife and babies, who had not\r\nharmed me, should come crying and pleading, I couldn't stand it; I\r\nknow I should forgive him and let him go, even if he had violated a\r\nmonastery. Henry of Huntington has been watching Godfrey and Marmion for\r\nnearly seven hundred and fifty years, now, but I couldn't do it, I\r\nknow I couldn't. I am soft and gentle in my nature, and I should have\r\nforgiven them seventy-and-seven times, long ago. And I think God has;\r\nbut this is only an opinion, and not authoritative, like Henry of\r\nHuntington's interpretations. I could learn to interpret, but I have\r\nnever tried; I get so little time.\r\n\r\nAll through his book Henry exhibits his familiarity with the intentions\r\nof God, and with the reasons for his intentions. Sometimes--very often,\r\nin fact--the act follows the intention after such a wide interval of\r\ntime that one wonders how Henry could fit one act out of a hundred to\r\none intention out of a hundred and get the thing right every time when\r\nthere was such abundant choice among acts and intentions. Sometimes a\r\nman offends the Deity with a crime, and is punished for it thirty years\r\nlater; meantime he has committed a million other crimes: no matter,\r\nHenry can pick out the one that brought the worms. Worms were generally\r\nused in those days for the slaying of particularly wicked people.\r\nThis has gone out, now, but in old times it was a favorite. It always\r\nindicated a case of \"wrath.\" For instance:\r\n\r\n... the just God avenging Robert Fitzhilderbrand's perfidy, a worm grew\r\nin his vitals, which gradually gnawing its way through his intestines\r\nfattened on the abandoned man till, tortured with excruciating\r\nsufferings and venting himself in bitter moans, he was by a fitting\r\npunishment brought to his end.--(P. 400.)\r\n\r\nIt was probably an alligator, but we cannot tell; we only know it was a\r\nparticular breed, and only used to convey wrath. Some authorities think\r\nit was an ichthyosaurus, but there is much doubt.\r\n\r\nHowever, one thing we do know; and that is that that worm had been\r\ndue years and years. Robert F. had violated a monastery once; he had\r\ncommitted unprintable crimes since, and they had been permitted--under\r\ndisapproval--but the ravishment of the monastery had not been forgotten\r\nnor forgiven, and the worm came at last.\r\n\r\nWhy were these reforms put off in this strange way? What was to be\r\ngained by it? Did Henry of Huntington really know his facts, or was he\r\nonly guessing? Sometimes I am half persuaded that he is only a guesser,\r\nand not a good one. The divine wisdom must surely be of the better\r\nquality than he makes it out to be.\r\n\r\nFive hundred years before Henry's time some forecasts of the Lord's\r\npurposes were furnished by a pope, who perceived, by certain perfectly\r\ntrustworthy signs furnished by the Deity for the information of His\r\nfamiliars, that the end of the world was\r\n\r\n... about to come. But as this end of the world draws near many things\r\nare at hand which have not before happened, as changes in the air,\r\nterrible signs in the heavens, tempests out of the common order of the\r\nseasons, wars, famines, pestilences, earthquakes in various places; all\r\nwhich will not happen in our days, but after our days all will come to\r\npass.\r\n\r\nStill, the end was so near that these signs were \"sent before that we\r\nmay be careful for our souls and be found prepared to meet the impending\r\njudgment.\"\r\n\r\nThat was thirteen hundred years ago. This is really no improvement on\r\nthe work of the Roman augurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCERNING TOBACCO\r\n\r\n(Written about 1893; not before published)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs concerns tobacco, there are many superstitions. And the chiefest is\r\nthis--that there is a STANDARD governing the matter, whereas there is\r\nnothing of the kind. Each man's own preference is the only standard for\r\nhim, the only one which he can accept, the only one which can command\r\nhim. A congress of all the tobacco-lovers in the world could not elect\r\na standard which would be binding upon you or me, or would even much\r\ninfluence us.\r\n\r\nThe next superstition is that a man has a standard of his own. He\r\nhasn't. He thinks he has, but he hasn't. He thinks he can tell what he\r\nregards as a good cigar from what he regards as a bad one--but he can't.\r\nHe goes by the brand, yet imagines he goes by the flavor. One may palm\r\noff the worst counterfeit upon him; if it bears his brand he will smoke\r\nit contentedly and never suspect.\r\n\r\nChildren of twenty-five, who have seven years of experience, try to tell me\r\nwhat is a good cigar and what isn't. Me, who never learned to smoke, but\r\nalways smoked; me, who came into the world asking for a light.\r\n\r\nNo one can tell me what is a good cigar--for me. I am the only judge.\r\nPeople who claim to know say that I smoke the worst cigars in the world.\r\nThey bring their own cigars when they come to my house. They betray an\r\nunmanly terror when I offer them a cigar; they tell lies and hurry away\r\nto meet engagements which they have not made when they are threatened\r\nwith the hospitalities of my box. Now then, observe what superstition,\r\nassisted by a man's reputation, can do. I was to have twelve personal\r\nfriends to supper one night. One of them was as notorious for costly\r\nand elegant cigars as I was for cheap and devilish ones. I called at his\r\nhouse and when no one was looking borrowed a double handful of his very\r\nchoicest; cigars which cost him forty cents apiece and bore red-and-gold\r\nlabels in sign of their nobility. I removed the labels and put the\r\ncigars into a box with my favorite brand on it--a brand which those\r\npeople all knew, and which cowed them as men are cowed by an epidemic.\r\nThey took these cigars when offered at the end of the supper, and lit\r\nthem and sternly struggled with them--in dreary silence, for hilarity\r\ndied when the fell brand came into view and started around--but their\r\nfortitude held for a short time only; then they made excuses and filed\r\nout, treading on one another's heels with indecent eagerness; and in the\r\nmorning when I went out to observe results the cigars lay all between\r\nthe front door and the gate. All except one--that one lay in the plate\r\nof the man from whom I had cabbaged the lot. One or two whiffs was all\r\nhe could stand. He told me afterward that some day I would get shot for\r\ngiving people that kind of cigars to smoke.\r\n\r\nAm I certain of my own standard? Perfectly; yes, absolutely--unless\r\nsomebody fools me by putting my brand on some other kind of cigar; for\r\nno doubt I am like the rest, and know my cigar by the brand instead of\r\nby the flavor. However, my standard is a pretty wide one and covers a\r\ngood deal of territory. To me, almost any cigar is good that nobody\r\nelse will smoke, and to me almost all cigars are bad that other people\r\nconsider good. Nearly any cigar will do me, except a Havana. People\r\nthink they hurt my feelings when they come to my house with their life\r\npreservers on--I mean, with their own cigars in their pockets. It is\r\nan error; I take care of myself in a similar way. When I go into\r\ndanger--that is, into rich people's houses, where, in the nature of\r\nthings, they will have high-tariff cigars, red-and-gilt girded and\r\nnested in a rosewood box along with a damp sponge, cigars which develop\r\na dismal black ash and burn down the side and smell, and will grow hot\r\nto the fingers, and will go on growing hotter and hotter, and go on\r\nsmelling more and more infamously and unendurably the deeper the fire\r\ntunnels down inside below the thimbleful of honest tobacco that is in\r\nthe front end, the furnisher of it praising it all the time and telling\r\nyou how much the deadly thing cost--yes, when I go into that sort of\r\nperil I carry my own defense along; I carry my own brand--twenty-seven\r\ncents a barrel--and I live to see my family again. I may seem to light\r\nhis red-gartered cigar, but that is only for courtesy's sake; I smuggle\r\nit into my pocket for the poor, of whom I know many, and light one of\r\nmy own; and while he praises it I join in, but when he says it cost\r\nforty-five cents I say nothing, for I know better.\r\n\r\nHowever, to say true, my tastes are so catholic that I have never seen\r\nany cigars that I really could not smoke, except those that cost a\r\ndollar apiece. I have examined those and know that they are made of\r\ndog-hair, and not good dog-hair at that.\r\n\r\nI have a thoroughly satisfactory time in Europe, for all over the\r\nContinent one finds cigars which not even the most hardened newsboys in\r\nNew York would smoke. I brought cigars with me, the last time; I will\r\nnot do that any more. In Italy, as in France, the Government is the only\r\ncigar-peddler. Italy has three or four domestic brands: the Minghetti,\r\nthe Trabuco, the Virginia, and a very coarse one which is a modification\r\nof the Virginia. The Minghettis are large and comely, and cost three\r\ndollars and sixty cents a hundred; I can smoke a hundred in seven days\r\nand enjoy every one of them. The Trabucos suit me, too; I don't remember\r\nthe price. But one has to learn to like the Virginia, nobody is born\r\nfriendly to it. It looks like a rat-tail file, but smokes better, some\r\nthink. It has a straw through it; you pull this out, and it leaves a\r\nflue, otherwise there would be no draught, not even as much as there is\r\nto a nail. Some prefer a nail at first. However, I like all the French,\r\nSwiss, German, and Italian domestic cigars, and have never cared to\r\ninquire what they are made of; and nobody would know, anyhow, perhaps.\r\nThere is even a brand of European smoking-tobacco that I like. It is a\r\nbrand used by the Italian peasants. It is loose and dry and black, and\r\nlooks like tea-grounds. When the fire is applied it expands, and climbs\r\nup and towers above the pipe, and presently tumbles off inside of one's\r\nvest. The tobacco itself is cheap, but it raises the insurance. It is\r\nas I remarked in the beginning--the taste for tobacco is a matter of\r\nsuperstition. There are no standards--no real standards. Each man's\r\npreference is the only standard for him, the only one which he can\r\naccept, the only one which can command him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEE\r\n\r\nIt was Maeterlinck who introduced me to the bee. I mean, in the\r\npsychical and in the poetical way. I had had a business introduction\r\nearlier. It was when I was a boy. It is strange that I should remember a\r\nformality like that so long; it must be nearly sixty years.\r\n\r\nBee scientists always speak of the bee as she. It is because all the\r\nimportant bees are of that sex. In the hive there is one married bee,\r\ncalled the queen; she has fifty thousand children; of these, about one\r\nhundred are sons; the rest are daughters. Some of the daughters are\r\nyoung maids, some are old maids, and all are virgins and remain so.\r\n\r\nEvery spring the queen comes out of the hive and flies away with one of\r\nher sons and marries him. The honeymoon lasts only an hour or two; then\r\nthe queen divorces her husband and returns home competent to lay two\r\nmillion eggs. This will be enough to last the year, but not more than\r\nenough, because hundreds of bees get drowned every day, and other\r\nhundreds are eaten by birds, and it is the queen's business to keep the\r\npopulation up to standard--say, fifty thousand. She must always have\r\nthat many children on hand and efficient during the busy season, which\r\nis summer, or winter would catch the community short of food. She lays\r\nfrom two thousand to three thousand eggs a day, according to the demand;\r\nand she must exercise judgment, and not lay more than are needed in a\r\nslim flower-harvest, nor fewer than are required in a prodigal one, or\r\nthe board of directors will dethrone her and elect a queen that has more\r\nsense.\r\n\r\nThere are always a few royal heirs in stock and ready to take her\r\nplace--ready and more than anxious to do it, although she is their own\r\nmother. These girls are kept by themselves, and are regally fed and\r\ntended from birth. No other bees get such fine food as they get, or\r\nlive such a high and luxurious life. By consequence they are larger and\r\nlonger and sleeker than their working sisters. And they have a curved\r\nsting, shaped like a scimitar, while the others have a straight one.\r\n\r\nA common bee will sting any one or anybody, but a royalty stings\r\nroyalties only. A common bee will sting and kill another common bee,\r\nfor cause, but when it is necessary to kill the queen other ways are\r\nemployed. When a queen has grown old and slack and does not lay eggs\r\nenough one of her royal daughters is allowed to come to attack her, the\r\nrest of the bees looking on at the duel and seeing fair play. It is a\r\nduel with the curved stings. If one of the fighters gets hard pressed\r\nand gives it up and runs, she is brought back and must try again--once,\r\nmaybe twice; then, if she runs yet once more for her life, judicial\r\ndeath is her portion; her children pack themselves into a ball around\r\nher person and hold her in that compact grip two or three days, until\r\nshe starves to death or is suffocated. Meantime the victor bee is\r\nreceiving royal honors and performing the one royal function--laying\r\neggs.\r\n\r\nAs regards the ethics of the judicial assassination of the queen, that\r\nis a matter of politics, and will be discussed later, in its proper\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nDuring substantially the whole of her short life of five or six years\r\nthe queen lives in the Egyptian darkness and stately seclusion of the royal\r\napartments, with none about her but plebeian servants, who give her\r\nempty lip-affection in place of the love which her heart hungers for;\r\nwho spy upon her in the interest of her waiting heirs, and report and\r\nexaggerate her defects and deficiencies to them; who fawn upon her and\r\nflatter her to her face and slander her behind her back; who grovel\r\nbefore her in the day of her power and forsake her in her age and\r\nweakness. There she sits, friendless, upon her throne through the long\r\nnight of her life, cut off from the consoling sympathies and sweet\r\ncompanionship and loving endearments which she craves, by the gilded\r\nbarriers of her awful rank; a forlorn exile in her own house and home,\r\nweary object of formal ceremonies and machine-made worship, winged child\r\nof the sun, native to the free air and the blue skies and the flowery\r\nfields, doomed by the splendid accident of her birth to trade this\r\npriceless heritage for a black captivity, a tinsel grandeur, and a\r\nloveless life, with shame and insult at the end and a cruel death--and\r\ncondemned by the human instinct in her to hold the bargain valuable!\r\n\r\nHuber, Lubbock, Maeterlinck--in fact, all the great authorities--are\r\nagreed in denying that the bee is a member of the human family. I do not\r\nknow why they have done this, but I think it is from dishonest motives.\r\nWhy, the innumerable facts brought to light by their own painstaking\r\nand exhaustive experiments prove that if there is a master fool in the\r\nworld, it is the bee. That seems to settle it.\r\n\r\nBut that is the way of the scientist. He will spend thirty years in\r\nbuilding up a mountain range of facts with the intent to prove a\r\ncertain theory; then he is so happy in his achievement that as a rule\r\nhe overlooks the main chief fact of all--that his accumulation proves an\r\nentirely different thing. When you point out this miscarriage to him he\r\ndoes not answer your letters; when you call to convince him, the servant\r\nprevaricates and you do not get in. Scientists have odious manners,\r\nexcept when you prop up their theory; then you can borrow money of them.\r\n\r\nTo be strictly fair, I will concede that now and then one of them will\r\nanswer your letter, but when they do they avoid the issue--you cannot\r\npin them down. When I discovered that the bee was human I wrote about it\r\nto all those scientists whom I have just mentioned. For evasions, I have\r\nseen nothing to equal the answers I got.\r\n\r\nAfter the queen, the personage next in importance in the hive is the\r\nvirgin. The virgins are fifty thousand or one hundred thousand in\r\nnumber, and they are the workers, the laborers. No work is done, in the\r\nhive or out of it, save by them. The males do not work, the queen does\r\nno work, unless laying eggs is work, but it does not seem so to me.\r\nThere are only two million of them, anyway, and all of five months\r\nto finish the contract in. The distribution of work in a hive is\r\nas cleverly and elaborately specialized as it is in a vast American\r\nmachine-shop or factory. A bee that has been trained to one of the many\r\nand various industries of the concern doesn't know how to exercise any\r\nother, and would be offended if asked to take a hand in anything outside\r\nof her profession. She is as human as a cook; and if you should ask the\r\ncook to wait on the table, you know what would happen. Cooks will play\r\nthe piano if you like, but they draw the line there. In my time I have\r\nasked a cook to chop wood, and I know about these things. Even the hired\r\ngirl has her frontiers; true, they are vague, they are ill-defined, even\r\nflexible, but they are there. This is not conjecture; it is founded on\r\nthe absolute. And then the butler. You ask the butler to wash the dog.\r\nIt is just as I say; there is much to be learned in these ways, without\r\ngoing to books. Books are very well, but books do not cover the whole\r\ndomain of esthetic human culture. Pride of profession is one of the\r\nboniest bones in existence, if not the boniest. Without doubt it is so\r\nin the hive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTAMING THE BICYCLE\r\n\r\n(Written about 1893; not before published)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early eighties Mark Twain learned to ride one of the old\r\nhigh-wheel bicycles of that period. He wrote an account of his\r\nexperience, but did not offer it for publication. The form of bicycle he\r\nrode long ago became antiquated, but in the humor of his pleasantry is a\r\nquality which does not grow old.\r\n\r\nA. B. P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nI thought the matter over, and concluded I could do it. So I went down\r\nand bought a barrel of Pond's Extract and a bicycle. The Expert came home\r\nwith me to instruct me. We chose the back yard, for the sake of privacy,\r\nand went to work.\r\n\r\nMine was not a full-grown bicycle, but only a colt--a fifty-inch, with\r\nthe pedals shortened up to forty-eight--and skittish, like any other\r\ncolt. The Expert explained the thing's points briefly, then he got on\r\nits back and rode around a little, to show me how easy it was to do. He\r\nsaid that the dismounting was perhaps the hardest thing to learn, and so\r\nwe would leave that to the last. But he was in error there. He found, to\r\nhis surprise and joy, that all that he needed to do was to get me on to\r\nthe machine and stand out of the way; I could get off, myself. Although\r\nI was wholly inexperienced, I dismounted in the best time on record. He\r\nwas on that side, shoving up the machine; we all came down with a crash,\r\nhe at the bottom, I next, and the machine on top.\r\n\r\nWe examined the machine, but it was not in the least injured. This was\r\nhardly believable. Yet the Expert assured me that it was true; in fact,\r\nthe examination proved it. I was partly to realize, then, how admirably\r\nthese things are constructed. We applied some Pond's Extract, and\r\nresumed. The Expert got on the OTHER side to shove up this time, but I\r\ndismounted on that side; so the result was as before.\r\n\r\nThe machine was not hurt. We oiled ourselves up again, and resumed. This\r\ntime the Expert took up a sheltered position behind, but somehow or\r\nother we landed on him again.\r\n\r\nHe was full of surprised admiration; said it was abnormal. She was all right,\r\nnot a scratch on her, not a timber started anywhere. I said it was\r\nwonderful, while we were greasing up, but he said that when I came to\r\nknow these steel spider-webs I would realize that nothing but dynamite\r\ncould cripple them. Then he limped out to position, and we resumed once\r\nmore. This time the Expert took up the position of short-stop, and got\r\na man to shove up behind. We got up a handsome speed, and presently\r\ntraversed a brick, and I went out over the top of the tiller and landed,\r\nhead down, on the instructor's back, and saw the machine fluttering in\r\nthe air between me and the sun. It was well it came down on us, for that\r\nbroke the fall, and it was not injured.\r\n\r\nFive days later I got out and was carried down to the hospital, and\r\nfound the Expert doing pretty fairly. In a few more days I was quite\r\nsound. I attribute this to my prudence in always dismounting on\r\nsomething soft. Some recommend a feather bed, but I think an Expert is\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nThe Expert got out at last, brought four assistants with him. It was a\r\ngood idea. These four held the graceful cobweb upright while I climbed\r\ninto the saddle; then they formed in column and marched on either\r\nside of me while the Expert pushed behind; all hands assisted at the\r\ndismount.\r\n\r\nThe bicycle had what is called the \"wabbles,\" and had them very badly.\r\nIn order to keep my position, a good many things were required of me,\r\nand in every instance the thing required was against nature. Against\r\nnature, but not against the laws of nature. That is to say, that\r\nwhatever the needed thing might be, my nature, habit, and breeding moved\r\nme to attempt it in one way, while some immutable and unsuspected law of\r\nphysics required that it be done in just the other way. I perceived by\r\nthis how radically and grotesquely wrong had been the life-long\r\neducation of my body and members. They were steeped in ignorance; they\r\nknew nothing--nothing which it could profit them to know. For instance,\r\nif I found myself falling to the right, I put the tiller hard down the\r\nother way, by a quite natural impulse, and so violated a law, and kept\r\non going down. The law required the opposite thing--the big wheel must\r\nbe turned in the direction in which you are falling. It is hard to\r\nbelieve this, when you are told it. And not merely hard to believe it,\r\nbut impossible; it is opposed to all your notions. And it is just as\r\nhard to do it, after you do come to believe it. Believing it, and\r\nknowing by the most convincing proof that it is true, does not help it:\r\nyou can't any more DO it than you could before; you can neither force\r\nnor persuade yourself to do it at first. The intellect has to come to\r\nthe front, now. It has to teach the limbs to discard their old education\r\nand adopt the new.\r\n\r\nThe steps of one's progress are distinctly marked. At the end of each\r\nlesson he knows he has acquired something, and he also knows what that\r\nsomething is, and likewise that it will stay with him. It is not like\r\nstudying German, where you mull along, in a groping, uncertain way, for\r\nthirty years; and at last, just as you think you've got it, they spring\r\nthe subjunctive on you, and there you are. No--and I see now, plainly\r\nenough, that the great pity about the German language is, that you can't\r\nfall off it and hurt yourself. There is nothing like that feature to\r\nmake you attend strictly to business. But I also see, by what I have\r\nlearned of bicycling, that the right and only sure way to learn German\r\nis by the bicycling method. That is to say, take a grip on one villainy\r\nof it at a time, and learn it--not ease up and shirk to the next,\r\nleaving that one half learned.\r\n\r\nWhen you have reached the point in bicycling where you can balance the\r\nmachine tolerably fairly and propel it and steer it, then comes your\r\nnext task--how to mount it. You do it in this way: you hop along behind\r\nit on your right foot, resting the other on the mounting-peg, and\r\ngrasping the tiller with your hands. At the word, you rise on the\r\npeg, stiffen your left leg, hang your other one around in the air in\r\na general in indefinite way, lean your stomach against the rear of the\r\nsaddle, and then fall off, maybe on one side, maybe on the other;\r\nbut you fall off. You get up and do it again; and once more; and then\r\nseveral times.\r\n\r\nBy this time you have learned to keep your balance; and also to steer\r\nwithout wrenching the tiller out by the roots (I say tiller because it\r\nIS a tiller; \"handle-bar\" is a lamely descriptive phrase). So you steer\r\nalong, straight ahead, a little while, then you rise forward, with a\r\nsteady strain, bringing your right leg, and then your body, into the\r\nsaddle, catch your breath, fetch a violent hitch this way and then that,\r\nand down you go again.\r\n\r\nBut you have ceased to mind the going down by this time; you are getting\r\nto light on one foot or the other with considerable certainty. Six more\r\nattempts and six more falls make you perfect. You land in the saddle\r\ncomfortably, next time, and stay there--that is, if you can be content\r\nto let your legs dangle, and leave the pedals alone a while; but if you\r\ngrab at once for the pedals, you are gone again. You soon learn to wait\r\na little and perfect your balance before reaching for the pedals; then\r\nthe mounting-art is acquired, is complete, and a little practice will\r\nmake it simple and easy to you, though spectators ought to keep off\r\na rod or two to one side, along at first, if you have nothing against\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAnd now you come to the voluntary dismount; you learned the other kind\r\nfirst of all. It is quite easy to tell one how to do the voluntary\r\ndismount; the words are few, the requirement simple, and apparently\r\nundifficult; let your left pedal go down till your left leg is nearly\r\nstraight, turn your wheel to the left, and get off as you would from a\r\nhorse. It certainly does sound exceedingly easy; but it isn't. I don't\r\nknow why it isn't but it isn't. Try as you may, you don't get down as\r\nyou would from a horse, you get down as you would from a house afire.\r\nYou make a spectacle of yourself every time.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nDuring the eight days I took a daily lesson of an hour and a half. At the\r\nend of this twelve working-hours' apprenticeship I was graduated--in\r\nthe rough. I was pronounced competent to paddle my own bicycle without\r\noutside help. It seems incredible, this celerity of acquirement. It\r\ntakes considerably longer than that to learn horseback-riding in the\r\nrough.\r\n\r\nNow it is true that I could have learned without a teacher, but it\r\nwould have been risky for me, because of my natural clumsiness. The\r\nself-taught man seldom knows anything accurately, and he does not know\r\na tenth as much as he could have known if he had worked under teachers;\r\nand, besides, he brags, and is the means of fooling other thoughtless\r\npeople into going and doing as he himself has done. There are those who\r\nimagine that the unlucky accidents of life--life's \"experiences\"--are in\r\nsome way useful to us. I wish I could find out how. I never knew one of\r\nthem to happen twice. They always change off and swap around and catch\r\nyou on your inexperienced side. If personal experience can be worth\r\nanything as an education, it wouldn't seem likely that you could trip\r\nMethuselah; and yet if that old person could come back here it is more\r\nthan likely that one of the first things he would do would be to take\r\nhold of one of these electric wires and tie himself all up in a knot.\r\nNow the surer thing and the wiser thing would be for him to ask somebody\r\nwhether it was a good thing to take hold of. But that would not suit\r\nhim; he would be one of the self-taught kind that go by experience;\r\nhe would want to examine for himself. And he would find, for his\r\ninstruction, that the coiled patriarch shuns the electric wire; and it\r\nwould be useful to him, too, and would leave his education in quite a\r\ncomplete and rounded-out condition, till he should come again, some day,\r\nand go to bouncing a dynamite-can around to find out what was in it.\r\n\r\nBut we wander from the point. However, get a teacher; it saves much time\r\nand Pond's Extract.\r\n\r\nBefore taking final leave of me, my instructor inquired concerning my\r\nphysical strength, and I was able to inform him that I hadn't any. He\r\nsaid that that was a defect which would make up-hill wheeling pretty\r\ndifficult for me at first; but he also said the bicycle would soon\r\nremove it. The contrast between his muscles and mine was quite marked.\r\nHe wanted to test mine, so I offered my biceps--which was my best. It\r\nalmost made him smile. He said, \"It is pulpy, and soft, and yielding,\r\nand rounded; it evades pressure, and glides from under the fingers; in\r\nthe dark a body might think it was an oyster in a rag.\" Perhaps this\r\nmade me look grieved, for he added, briskly: \"Oh, that's all right, you\r\nneedn't worry about that; in a little while you can't tell it from a\r\npetrified kidney. Just go right along with your practice; you're all\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\nThen he left me, and I started out alone to seek adventures. You don't\r\nreally have to seek them--that is nothing but a phrase--they come to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nI chose a reposeful Sabbath-day sort of a back street which was about\r\nthirty yards wide between the curbstones. I knew it was not wide enough;\r\nstill, I thought that by keeping strict watch and wasting no space\r\nunnecessarily I could crowd through.\r\n\r\nOf course I had trouble mounting the machine, entirely on my own\r\nresponsibility, with no encouraging moral support from the outside,\r\nno sympathetic instructor to say, \"Good! now you're doing well--good\r\nagain--don't hurry--there, now, you're all right--brace up, go ahead.\"\r\nIn place of this I had some other support. This was a boy, who was\r\nperched on a gate-post munching a hunk of maple sugar.\r\n\r\nHe was full of interest and comment. The first time I failed and went\r\ndown he said that if he was me he would dress up in pillows, that's what\r\nhe would do. The next time I went down he advised me to go and learn\r\nto ride a tricycle first. The third time I collapsed he said he didn't\r\nbelieve I could stay on a horse-car. But the next time I succeeded, and\r\ngot clumsily under way in a weaving, tottering, uncertain fashion, and\r\noccupying pretty much all of the street. My slow and lumbering gait\r\nfilled the boy to the chin with scorn, and he sung out, \"My, but don't\r\nhe rip along!\" Then he got down from his post and loafed along the\r\nsidewalk, still observing and occasionally commenting. Presently he\r\ndropped into my wake and followed along behind. A little girl passed\r\nby, balancing a wash-board on her head, and giggled, and seemed about to\r\nmake a remark, but the boy said, rebukingly, \"Let him alone, he's going\r\nto a funeral.\"\r\n\r\nI have been familiar with that street for years, and had always supposed\r\nit was a dead level; but it was not, as the bicycle now informed me,\r\nto my surprise. The bicycle, in the hands of a novice, is as alert and\r\nacute as a spirit-level in the detecting of delicate and vanishing\r\nshades of difference in these matters. It notices a rise where your\r\nuntrained eye would not observe that one existed; it notices any decline\r\nwhich water will run down. I was toiling up a slight rise, but was not\r\naware of it. It made me tug and pant and perspire; and still, labor as\r\nI might, the machine came almost to a standstill every little while. At\r\nsuch times the boy would say: \"That's it! take a rest--there ain't no\r\nhurry. They can't hold the funeral without YOU.\"\r\n\r\nStones were a bother to me. Even the smallest ones gave me a panic when\r\nI went over them. I could hit any kind of a stone, no matter how small,\r\nif I tried to miss it; and of course at first I couldn't help trying to\r\ndo that. It is but natural. It is part of the ass that is put in us all,\r\nfor some inscrutable reason.\r\n\r\nI was at the end of my course, at last, and it was necessary for me to\r\nround to. This is not a pleasant thing, when you undertake it for the\r\nfirst time on your own responsibility, and neither is it likely to\r\nsucceed. Your confidence oozes away, you fill steadily up with nameless\r\napprehensions, every fiber of you is tense with a watchful strain, you\r\nstart a cautious and gradual curve, but your squirmy nerves are all full\r\nof electric anxieties, so the curve is quickly demoralized into a jerky\r\nand perilous zigzag; then suddenly the nickel-clad horse takes the bit\r\nin its mouth and goes slanting for the curbstone, defying all prayers\r\nand all your powers to change its mind--your heart stands still, your\r\nbreath hangs fire, your legs forget to work, straight on you go, and\r\nthere are but a couple of feet between you and the curb now. And now is\r\nthe desperate moment, the last chance to save yourself; of course all\r\nyour instructions fly out of your head, and you whirl your wheel AWAY\r\nfrom the curb instead of TOWARD it, and so you go sprawling on that\r\ngranite-bound inhospitable shore. That was my luck; that was my\r\nexperience. I dragged myself out from under the indestructible bicycle\r\nand sat down on the curb to examine.\r\n\r\nI started on the return trip. It was now that I saw a farmer's wagon\r\npoking along down toward me, loaded with cabbages. If I needed anything\r\nto perfect the precariousness of my steering, it was just that. The\r\nfarmer was occupying the middle of the road with his wagon, leaving\r\nbarely fourteen or fifteen yards of space on either side. I couldn't\r\nshout at him--a beginner can't shout; if he opens his mouth he is gone;\r\nhe must keep all his attention on his business. But in this grisly\r\nemergency, the boy came to the rescue, and for once I had to be grateful\r\nto him. He kept a sharp lookout on the swiftly varying impulses and\r\ninspirations of my bicycle, and shouted to the man accordingly:\r\n\r\n\"To the left! Turn to the left, or this jackass 'll run over you!\" The\r\nman started to do it. \"No, to the right, to the right! Hold on!\r\nTHAT won't do!--to the left!--to the right!--to the LEFT--right!\r\nleft--ri--Stay where you ARE, or you're a goner!\"\r\n\r\nAnd just then I caught the off horse in the starboard and went down in a\r\npile. I said, \"Hang it! Couldn't you SEE I was coming?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I see you was coming, but I couldn't tell which WAY you was\r\ncoming. Nobody could--now, COULD they? You couldn't yourself--now, COULD\r\nyou? So what could _I_ do?\"\r\n\r\nThere was something in that, and so I had the magnanimity to say so. I\r\nsaid I was no doubt as much to blame as he was.\r\n\r\nWithin the next five days I achieved so much progress that the boy\r\ncouldn't keep up with me. He had to go back to his gate-post, and\r\ncontent himself with watching me fall at long range.\r\n\r\nThere was a row of low stepping-stones across one end of the street, a\r\nmeasured yard apart. Even after I got so I could steer pretty fairly I\r\nwas so afraid of those stones that I always hit them. They gave me the\r\nworst falls I ever got in that street, except those which I got from\r\ndogs. I have seen it stated that no expert is quick enough to run over a\r\ndog; that a dog is always able to skip out of his way. I think that that\r\nmay be true: but I think that the reason he couldn't run over the dog\r\nwas because he was trying to. I did not try to run over any dog. But\r\nI ran over every dog that came along. I think it makes a great deal of\r\ndifference. If you try to run over the dog he knows how to calculate,\r\nbut if you are trying to miss him he does not know how to calculate,\r\nand is liable to jump the wrong way every time. It was always so in my\r\nexperience. Even when I could not hit a wagon I could hit a dog that\r\ncame to see me practice. They all liked to see me practice, and they\r\nall came, for there was very little going on in our neighborhood to\r\nentertain a dog. It took time to learn to miss a dog, but I achieved\r\neven that.\r\n\r\nI can steer as well as I want to, now, and I will catch that boy out\r\none of these days and run over HIM if he doesn't reform.\r\n\r\nGet a bicycle. You will not regret it, if you live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIS SHAKESPEARE DEAD?\r\n\r\n(from My Autobiography)\r\n\r\nScattered here and there through the stacks of unpublished manuscript\r\nwhich constitute this formidable Autobiography and Diary of mine,\r\ncertain chapters will in some distant future be found which deal with\r\n\"Claimants\"--claimants historically notorious: Satan, Claimant; the\r\nGolden Calf, Claimant; the Veiled Prophet of Khorassan, Claimant; Louis\r\nXVII., Claimant; William Shakespeare, Claimant; Arthur Orton, Claimant;\r\nMary Baker G. Eddy, Claimant--and the rest of them. Eminent Claimants,\r\nsuccessful Claimants, defeated Claimants, royal Claimants, pleb\r\nClaimants, showy Claimants, shabby Claimants, revered Claimants,\r\ndespised Claimants, twinkle star-like here and there and yonder through\r\nthe mists of history and legend and tradition--and, oh, all the darling\r\ntribe are clothed in mystery and romance, and we read about them with\r\ndeep interest and discuss them with loving sympathy or with rancorous\r\nresentment, according to which side we hitch ourselves to. It has always\r\nbeen so with the human race. There was never a Claimant that couldn't\r\nget a hearing, nor one that couldn't accumulate a rapturous following,\r\nno matter how flimsy and apparently unauthentic his claim might be.\r\nArthur Orton's claim that he was the lost Tichborne baronet come to life\r\nagain was as flimsy as Mrs. Eddy's that she wrote SCIENCE AND HEALTH\r\nfrom the direct dictation of the Deity; yet in England nearly forty\r\nyears ago Orton had a huge army of devotees and incorrigible adherents,\r\nmany of whom remained stubbornly unconvinced after their fat god had\r\nbeen proven an impostor and jailed as a perjurer, and today Mrs. Eddy's\r\nfollowing is not only immense, but is daily augmenting in numbers and\r\nenthusiasm. Orton had many fine and educated minds among his adherents,\r\nMrs. Eddy has had the like among hers from the beginning. Her Church is\r\nas well equipped in those particulars as is any other Church. Claimants\r\ncan always count upon a following, it doesn't matter who they are, nor\r\nwhat they claim, nor whether they come with documents or without. It was\r\nalways so. Down out of the long-vanished past, across the abyss of\r\nthe ages, if you listen, you can still hear the believing multitudes\r\nshouting for Perkin Warbeck and Lambert Simnel.\r\n\r\nA friend has sent me a new book, from England--THE SHAKESPEARE PROBLEM\r\nRESTATED--well restated and closely reasoned; and my fifty years'\r\ninterest in that matter--asleep for the last three years--is excited\r\nonce more. It is an interest which was born of Delia Bacon's book--away\r\nback in that ancient day--1857, or maybe 1856. About a year later my\r\npilot-master, Bixby, transferred me from his own steamboat to the\r\nPENNSYLVANIA, and placed me under the orders and instructions of George\r\nEaler--dead now, these many, many years. I steered for him a good many\r\nmonths--as was the humble duty of the pilot-apprentice: stood a daylight\r\nwatch and spun the wheel under the severe superintendence and\r\ncorrection of the master. He was a prime chess-player and an idolater of\r\nShakespeare. He would play chess with anybody; even with me, and it cost\r\nhis official dignity something to do that. Also--quite uninvited--he\r\nwould read Shakespeare to me; not just casually, but by the hour, when\r\nit was his watch and I was steering. He read well, but not profitably\r\nfor me, because he constantly injected commands into the text. That\r\nbroke it all up, mixed it all up, tangled it all up--to that degree,\r\nin fact, that if we were in a risky and difficult piece of river an\r\nignorant person couldn't have told, sometimes, which observations were\r\nShakespeare's and which were Ealer's. For instance:\r\n\r\nWhat man dare, _I_ dare!\r\n\r\nApproach thou WHAT are you laying in the leads for? what a hell of\r\nan idea! like the rugged ease her off a little, ease her off! rugged\r\nRussian bear, the armed rhinoceros or the THERE she goes! meet her, meet\r\nher! didn't you KNOW she'd smell the reef if you crowded it like that?\r\nHyrcan tiger; take any shape but that and my firm nerves she'll be in the\r\nWOODS the first you know! stop the starboard! come ahead strong on the\r\nlarboard! back the starboard!... NOW then, you're all right; come ahead\r\non the starboard; straighten up and go 'long, never tremble: or be alive\r\nagain, and dare me to the desert DAMNATION can't you keep away from that\r\ngreasy water? pull her down! snatch her! snatch her baldheaded! with thy\r\nsword; if trembling I inhabit then, lay in the leads!--no, only with\r\nthe starboard one, leave the other alone, protest me the baby of a girl.\r\nHence horrible shadow! eight bells--that watchman's asleep again, I\r\nreckon, go down and call Brown yourself, unreal mockery, hence!\r\n\r\nHe certainly was a good reader, and splendidly thrilling and stormy and\r\ntragic, but it was a damage to me, because I have never since been\r\nable to read Shakespeare in a calm and sane way. I cannot rid it of his\r\nexplosive interlardings, they break in everywhere with their irrelevant,\r\n\"What in hell are you up to NOW! pull her down! more! MORE!--there now,\r\nsteady as you go,\" and the other disorganizing interruptions that were\r\nalways leaping from his mouth. When I read Shakespeare now I can hear\r\nthem as plainly as I did in that long-departed time--fifty-one years\r\nago. I never regarded Ealer's readings as educational. Indeed, they were\r\na detriment to me.\r\n\r\nHis contributions to the text seldom improved it, but barring that\r\ndetail he was a good reader; I can say that much for him. He did not use\r\nthe book, and did not need to; he knew his Shakespeare as well as Euclid\r\never knew his multiplication table.\r\n\r\nDid he have something to say--this Shakespeare-adoring Mississippi\r\npilot--anent Delia Bacon's book?\r\n\r\nYes. And he said it; said it all the time, for months--in the morning\r\nwatch, the middle watch, and dog watch; and probably kept it going\r\nin his sleep. He bought the literature of the dispute as fast as it\r\nappeared, and we discussed it all through thirteen hundred miles of\r\nriver four times traversed in every thirty-five days--the time required\r\nby that swift boat to achieve two round trips. We discussed, and\r\ndiscussed, and discussed, and disputed and disputed and disputed; at any\r\nrate, HE did, and I got in a word now and then when he slipped a cog\r\nand there was a vacancy. He did his arguing with heat, with energy,\r\nwith violence; and I did mine with the reserve and moderation of a\r\nsubordinate who does not like to be flung out of a pilot-house that is\r\nperched forty feet above the water. He was fiercely loyal to Shakespeare\r\nand cordially scornful of Bacon and of all the pretensions of the\r\nBaconians. So was I--at first. And at first he was glad that that was\r\nmy attitude. There were even indications that he admired it; indications\r\ndimmed, it is true, by the distance that lay between the lofty\r\nboss-pilotical altitude and my lowly one, yet perceptible to me;\r\nperceptible, and translatable into a compliment--compliment coming down\r\nfrom above the snow-line and not well thawed in the transit, and not\r\nlikely to set anything afire, not even a cub-pilot's self-conceit; still\r\na detectable complement, and precious.\r\n\r\nNaturally it flattered me into being more loyal to Shakespeare--if\r\npossible--than I was before, and more prejudiced against Bacon--if\r\npossible--than I was before. And so we discussed and discussed, both on\r\nthe same side, and were happy. For a while. Only for a while. Only for a\r\nvery little while, a very, very, very little while. Then the atmosphere\r\nbegan to change; began to cool off.\r\n\r\nA brighter person would have seen what the trouble was, earlier than I\r\ndid, perhaps, but I saw it early enough for all practical purposes. You\r\nsee, he was of an argumentative disposition. Therefore it took him but\r\na little time to get tired of arguing with a person who agreed with\r\neverything he said and consequently never furnished him a provocative\r\nto flare up and show what he could do when it came to clear, cold, hard,\r\nrose-cut, hundred-faceted, diamond-flashing REASONING. That was his name\r\nfor it. It has been applied since, with complacency, as many as several\r\ntimes, in the Bacon-Shakespeare scuffle. On the Shakespeare side.\r\n\r\nThen the thing happened which has happened to more persons than to me\r\nwhen principle and personal interest found themselves in opposition to\r\neach other and a choice had to be made: I let principle go, and went\r\nover to the other side. Not the entire way, but far enough to answer the\r\nrequirements of the case. That is to say, I took this attitude--to wit,\r\nI only BELIEVED Bacon wrote Shakespeare, whereas I KNEW Shakespeare\r\ndidn't. Ealer was satisfied with that, and the war broke loose. Study,\r\npractice, experience in handling my end of the matter presently enabled\r\nme to take my new position almost seriously; a little bit later, utterly\r\nseriously; a little later still, lovingly, gratefully, devotedly;\r\nfinally: fiercely, rabidly, uncompromisingly. After that I was welded\r\nto my faith, I was theoretically ready to die for it, and I looked down\r\nwith compassion not unmixed with scorn upon everybody else's faith that\r\ndidn't tally with mine. That faith, imposed upon me by self-interest\r\nin that ancient day, remains my faith today, and in it I find comfort,\r\nsolace, peace, and never-failing joy. You see how curiously theological\r\nit is. The \"rice Christian\" of the Orient goes through the very same\r\nsteps, when he is after rice and the missionary is after HIM; he goes\r\nfor rice, and remains to worship.\r\n\r\nEaler did a lot of our \"reasoning\"--not to say substantially all of it.\r\nThe slaves of his cult have a passion for calling it by that large name.\r\nWe others do not call our inductions and deductions and reductions by\r\nany name at all. They show for themselves what they are, and we can with\r\ntranquil confidence leave the world to ennoble them with a title of its\r\nown choosing.\r\n\r\nNow and then when Ealer had to stop to cough, I pulled my\r\ninduction-talents together and hove the controversial lead myself:\r\nalways getting eight feet, eight and a half, often nine, sometimes even\r\nquarter-less-twain--as _I_ believed; but always \"no bottom,\" as HE said.\r\n\r\nI got the best of him only once. I prepared myself. I wrote out a\r\npassage from Shakespeare--it may have been the very one I quoted\r\nawhile ago, I don't remember--and riddled it with his wild steamboatful\r\ninterlardings. When an unrisky opportunity offered, one lovely summer\r\nday, when we had sounded and buoyed a tangled patch of crossings known\r\nas Hell's Half Acre, and were aboard again and he had sneaked the\r\nPENNSYLVANIA triumphantly through it without once scraping sand, and the\r\nA. T. LACEY had followed in our wake and got stuck, and he was feeling\r\ngood, I showed it to him. It amused him. I asked him to fire it\r\noff--READ it; read it, I diplomatically added, as only HE could read\r\ndramatic poetry. The compliment touched him where he lived. He did read\r\nit; read it with surpassing fire and spirit; read it as it will never be\r\nread again; for HE knew how to put the right music into those thunderous\r\ninterlardings and make them seem a part of the text, make them sound as\r\nif they were bursting from Shakespeare's own soul, each one of them a\r\ngolden inspiration and not to be left out without damage to the massed\r\nand magnificent whole.\r\n\r\nI waited a week, to let the incident fade; waited longer; waited until\r\nhe brought up for reasonings and vituperation my pet position, my pet\r\nargument, the one which I was fondest of, the one which I prized far\r\nabove all others in my ammunition-wagon--to wit, that Shakespeare\r\ncouldn't have written Shakespeare's works, for the reason that the\r\nman who wrote them was limitlessly familiar with the laws, and the\r\nlaw-courts, and law-proceedings, and lawyer-talk, and lawyer-ways--and\r\nif Shakespeare was possessed of the infinitely divided star-dust that\r\nconstituted this vast wealth, HOW did he get it, and WHERE and WHEN?\r\n\r\n\"From books.\"\r\n\r\nFrom books! That was always the idea. I answered as my readings of the\r\nchampions of my side of the great controversy had taught me to\r\nanswer: that a man can't handle glibly and easily and comfortably and\r\nsuccessfully the argot of a trade at which he has not personally served.\r\nHe will make mistakes; he will not, and cannot, get the trade-phrasings\r\nprecisely and exactly right; and the moment he departs, by even a shade,\r\nfrom a common trade-form, the reader who has served that trade will know\r\nthe writer HASN'T. Ealer would not be convinced; he said a man\r\ncould learn how to correctly handle the subtleties and mysteries and\r\nfree-masonries of ANY trade by careful reading and studying. But when\r\nI got him to read again the passage from Shakespeare with the\r\ninterlardings, he perceived, himself, that books couldn't teach a\r\nstudent a bewildering multitude of pilot-phrases so thoroughly and\r\nperfectly that he could talk them off in book and play or conversation\r\nand make no mistake that a pilot would not immediately discover. It\r\nwas a triumph for me. He was silent awhile, and I knew what was\r\nhappening--he was losing his temper. And I knew he would presently close\r\nthe session with the same old argument that was always his stay and\r\nhis support in time of need; the same old argument, the one I couldn't\r\nanswer, because I dasn't--the argument that I was an ass, and better\r\nshut up. He delivered it, and I obeyed.\r\n\r\nO dear, how long ago it was--how pathetically long ago! And here am I,\r\nold, forsaken, forlorn, and alone, arranging to get that argument out of\r\nsomebody again.\r\n\r\nWhen a man has a passion for Shakespeare, it goes without saying that\r\nhe keeps company with other standard authors. Ealer always had several\r\nhigh-class books in the pilot-house, and he read the same ones over and\r\nover again, and did not care to change to newer and fresher ones. He\r\nplayed well on the flute, and greatly enjoyed hearing himself play. So\r\ndid I. He had a notion that a flute would keep its health better if you\r\ntook it apart when it was not standing a watch; and so, when it was not\r\non duty it took its rest, disjointed, on the compass-shelf under\r\nthe breastboard. When the PENNSYLVANIA blew up and became a drifting\r\nrack-heap freighted with wounded and dying poor souls (my young brother\r\nHenry among them), pilot Brown had the watch below, and was probably\r\nasleep and never knew what killed him; but Ealer escaped unhurt. He and\r\nhis pilot-house were shot up into the air; then they fell, and Ealer\r\nsank through the ragged cavern where the hurricane-deck and the\r\nboiler-deck had been, and landed in a nest of ruins on the main deck,\r\non top of one of the unexploded boilers, where he lay prone in a fog of\r\nscald and deadly steam. But not for long. He did not lose his head--long\r\nfamiliarity with danger had taught him to keep it, in any and all\r\nemergencies. He held his coat-lapels to his nose with one hand, to keep\r\nout the steam, and scrabbled around with the other till he found the\r\njoints of his flute, then he took measures to save himself alive, and\r\nwas successful. I was not on board. I had been put ashore in New Orleans\r\nby Captain Klinefelter. The reason--however, I have told all about it\r\nin the book called OLD TIMES ON THE MISSISSIPPI, and it isn't important,\r\nanyway, it is so long ago.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWhen I was a Sunday-school scholar, something more than sixty years ago,\r\nI became interested in Satan, and wanted to find out all I could about\r\nhim. I began to ask questions, but my class-teacher, Mr. Barclay, the\r\nstone-mason, was reluctant about answering them, it seemed to me. I was\r\nanxious to be praised for turning my thoughts to serious subjects when\r\nthere wasn't another boy in the village who could be hired to do such a\r\nthing. I was greatly interested in the incident of Eve and the serpent,\r\nand thought Eve's calmness was perfectly noble. I asked Mr. Barclay if\r\nhe had ever heard of another woman who, being approached by a serpent,\r\nwould not excuse herself and break for the nearest timber. He did not\r\nanswer my question, but rebuked me for inquiring into matters above my\r\nage and comprehension. I will say for Mr. Barclay that he was willing to\r\ntell me the facts of Satan's history, but he stopped there: he wouldn't\r\nallow any discussion of them.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time we exhausted the facts. There were only five\r\nor six of them; you could set them all down on a visiting-card. I was\r\ndisappointed. I had been meditating a biography, and was grieved to find\r\nthat there were no materials. I said as much, with the tears running\r\ndown. Mr. Barclay's sympathy and compassion were aroused, for he was\r\na most kind and gentle-spirited man, and he patted me on the head and\r\ncheered me up by saying there was a whole vast ocean of materials! I can\r\nstill feel the happy thrill which these blessed words shot through me.\r\n\r\nThen he began to bail out that ocean's riches for my encouragement and\r\njoy. Like this: it was \"conjectured\"--though not established--that Satan\r\nwas originally an angel in Heaven; that he fell; that he rebelled, and\r\nbrought on a war; that he was defeated, and banished to perdition. Also,\r\n\"we have reason to believe\" that later he did so and so; that \"we\r\nare warranted in supposing\" that at a subsequent time he traveled\r\nextensively, seeking whom he might devour; that a couple of centuries\r\nafterward, \"as tradition instructs us,\" he took up the cruel trade of\r\ntempting people to their ruin, with vast and fearful results; that\r\nby and by, \"as the probabilities seem to indicate,\" he may have done\r\ncertain things, he might have done certain other things, he must have\r\ndone still other things.\r\n\r\nAnd so on and so on. We set down the five known facts by themselves on a\r\npiece of paper, and numbered it \"page 1\"; then on fifteen hundred other\r\npieces of paper we set down the \"conjectures,\" and \"suppositions,\"\r\nand \"maybes,\" and \"perhapses,\" and \"doubtlesses,\" and \"rumors,\" and\r\n\"guesses,\" and \"probabilities,\" and \"likelihoods,\" and \"we are permitted\r\nto thinks,\" and \"we are warranted in believings,\" and \"might\r\nhave beens,\" and \"could have beens,\" and \"must have beens,\" and\r\n\"unquestionablys,\" and \"without a shadow of doubts\"--and behold!\r\n\r\nMATERIALS? Why, we had enough to build a biography of Shakespeare!\r\n\r\nYet he made me put away my pen; he would not let me write the history of\r\nSatan. Why? Because, as he said, he had suspicions--suspicions that\r\nmy attitude in that matter was not reverent, and that a person must be\r\nreverent when writing about the sacred characters. He said any one who\r\nspoke flippantly of Satan would be frowned upon by the religious world\r\nand also be brought to account.\r\n\r\nI assured him, in earnest and sincere words, that he had wholly\r\nmisconceived my attitude; that I had the highest respect for Satan, and\r\nthat my reverence for him equaled, and possibly even exceeded, that of\r\nany member of any church. I said it wounded me deeply to perceive by his\r\nwords that he thought I would make fun of Satan, and deride him, laugh\r\nat him, scoff at him; whereas in truth I had never thought of such a\r\nthing, but had only a warm desire to make fun of those others and\r\nlaugh at THEM. \"What others?\" \"Why, the Supposers, the Perhapsers, the\r\nMight-Have-Beeners, the Could-Have-Beeners, the Must-Have-Beeners, the\r\nWithout-a-Shadow-of-Doubters, the We-Are-Warranted-in-Believingers, and\r\nall that funny crop of solemn architects who have taken a good solid\r\nfoundation of five indisputable and unimportant facts and built upon it\r\na Conjectural Satan thirty miles high.\"\r\n\r\nWhat did Mr. Barclay do then? Was he disarmed? Was he silenced? No. He\r\nwas shocked. He was so shocked that he visibly shuddered. He said the\r\nSatanic Traditioners and Perhapsers and Conjecturers were THEMSELVES\r\nsacred! As sacred as their work. So sacred that whoso ventured to\r\nmock them or make fun of their work, could not afterward enter any\r\nrespectable house, even by the back door.\r\n\r\nHow true were his words, and how wise! How fortunate it would have been\r\nfor me if I had heeded them. But I was young, I was but seven years of\r\nage, and vain, foolish, and anxious to attract attention. I wrote the\r\nbiography, and have never been in a respectable house since.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nHow curious and interesting is the parallel--as far as poverty of\r\nbiographical details is concerned--between Satan and Shakespeare. It\r\nis wonderful, it is unique, it stands quite alone, there is nothing\r\nresembling it in history, nothing resembling it in romance, nothing\r\napproaching it even in tradition. How sublime is their position, and how\r\nover-topping, how sky-reaching, how supreme--the two Great Unknowns,\r\nthe two Illustrious Conjecturabilities! They are the best-known unknown\r\npersons that have ever drawn breath upon the planet.\r\n\r\nFor the instruction of the ignorant I will make a list, now, of those\r\ndetails of Shakespeare's history which are FACTS--verified facts,\r\nestablished facts, undisputed facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFacts\r\n\r\nHe was born on the 23d of April, 1564.\r\n\r\nOf good farmer-class parents who could not read, could not write, could\r\nnot sign their names.\r\n\r\nAt Stratford, a small back settlement which in that day was shabby and\r\nunclean, and densely illiterate. Of the nineteen important men charged\r\nwith the government of the town, thirteen had to \"make their mark\" in\r\nattesting important documents, because they could not write their names.\r\n\r\nOf the first eighteen years of his life NOTHING is known. They are a\r\nblank.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of November (1582) William Shakespeare took out a license to\r\nmarry Anne Whateley.\r\n\r\nNext day William Shakespeare took out a license to marry Anne Hathaway.\r\nShe was eight years his senior.\r\n\r\nWilliam Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway. In a hurry. By grace of a\r\nreluctantly granted dispensation there was but one publication of the\r\nbanns.\r\n\r\nWithin six months the first child was born.\r\n\r\nAbout two (blank) years followed, during which period NOTHING AT ALL\r\nHAPPENED TO SHAKESPEARE, so far as anybody knows.\r\n\r\nThen came twins--1585. February.\r\n\r\nTwo blank years follow.\r\n\r\nThen--1587--he makes a ten-year visit to London, leaving the family\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nFive blank years follow. During this period NOTHING HAPPENED TO HIM, as\r\nfar as anybody actually knows.\r\n\r\nThen--1592--there is mention of him as an actor.\r\n\r\nNext year--1593--his name appears in the official list of players.\r\n\r\nNext year--1594--he played before the queen. A detail of no consequence:\r\nother obscurities did it every year of the forty-five of her reign. And\r\nremained obscure.\r\n\r\nThree pretty full years follow. Full of play-acting. Then\r\n\r\nIn 1597 he bought New Place, Stratford.\r\n\r\nThirteen or fourteen busy years follow; years in which he accumulated\r\nmoney, and also reputation as actor and manager.\r\n\r\nMeantime his name, liberally and variously spelt, had become associated\r\nwith a number of great plays and poems, as (ostensibly) author of the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nSome of these, in these years and later, were pirated, but he made no\r\nprotest.\r\n\r\nThen--1610-11--he returned to Stratford and settled down for good and\r\nall, and busied himself in lending money, trading in tithes, trading in\r\nland and houses; shirking a debt of forty-one shillings, borrowed by\r\nhis wife during his long desertion of his family; suing debtors for\r\nshillings and coppers; being sued himself for shillings and coppers;\r\nand acting as confederate to a neighbor who tried to rob the town of its\r\nrights in a certain common, and did not succeed.\r\n\r\nHe lived five or six years--till 1616--in the joy of these elevated\r\npursuits. Then he made a will, and signed each of its three pages with\r\nhis name.\r\n\r\nA thoroughgoing business man's will. It named in minute detail\r\nevery item of property he owned in the world--houses, lands, sword,\r\nsilver-gilt bowl, and so on--all the way down to his \"second-best bed\"\r\nand its furniture.\r\n\r\nIt carefully and calculatingly distributed his riches among the members\r\nof his family, overlooking no individual of it. Not even his wife:\r\nthe wife he had been enabled to marry in a hurry by urgent grace of a\r\nspecial dispensation before he was nineteen; the wife whom he had left\r\nhusbandless so many years; the wife who had had to borrow forty-one\r\nshillings in her need, and which the lender was never able to collect of\r\nthe prosperous husband, but died at last with the money still lacking.\r\nNo, even this wife was remembered in Shakespeare's will.\r\n\r\nHe left her that \"second-best bed.\"\r\n\r\nAnd NOT ANOTHER THING; not even a penny to bless her lucky widowhood\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nIt was eminently and conspicuously a business man's will, not a poet's.\r\n\r\nIt mentioned NOT A SINGLE BOOK.\r\n\r\nBooks were much more precious than swords and silver-gilt bowls and\r\nsecond-best beds in those days, and when a departing person owned one he\r\ngave it a high place in his will.\r\n\r\nThe will mentioned NOT A PLAY, NOT A POEM, NOT AN UNFINISHED LITERARY\r\nWORK, NOT A SCRAP OF MANUSCRIPT OF ANY KIND.\r\n\r\nMany poets have died poor, but this is the only one in history that\r\nhas died THIS poor; the others all left literary remains behind. Also a\r\nbook. Maybe two.\r\n\r\nIf Shakespeare had owned a dog--but we need not go into that: we know he\r\nwould have mentioned it in his will. If a good dog, Susanna would have\r\ngot it; if an inferior one his wife would have got a dower interest in\r\nit. I wish he had had a dog, just so we could see how painstakingly he\r\nwould have divided that dog among the family, in his careful business\r\nway.\r\n\r\nHe signed the will in three places.\r\n\r\nIn earlier years he signed two other official documents.\r\n\r\nThese five signatures still exist.\r\n\r\nThere are NO OTHER SPECIMENS OF HIS PENMANSHIP IN EXISTENCE. Not a line.\r\n\r\nWas he prejudiced against the art? His granddaughter, whom he loved, was\r\neight years old when he died, yet she had had no teaching, he left no\r\nprovision for her education, although he was rich, and in her mature\r\nwomanhood she couldn't write and couldn't tell her husband's manuscript\r\nfrom anybody else's--she thought it was Shakespeare's.\r\n\r\nWhen Shakespeare died in Stratford, IT WAS NOT AN EVENT. It made no\r\nmore stir in England than the death of any other forgotten theater-actor\r\nwould have made. Nobody came down from London; there were no lamenting\r\npoems, no eulogies, no national tears--there was merely silence, and\r\nnothing more. A striking contrast with what happened when Ben Jonson,\r\nand Francis Bacon, and Spenser, and Raleigh, and the other distinguished\r\nliterary folk of Shakespeare's time passed from life! No praiseful voice\r\nwas lifted for the lost Bard of Avon; even Ben Jonson waited seven years\r\nbefore he lifted his.\r\n\r\nSO FAR AS ANYBODY ACTUALLY KNOWS AND CAN PROVE, Shakespeare of\r\nStratford-on-Avon never wrote a play in his life.\r\n\r\nSO FAR AS ANYBODY KNOWS AND CAN PROVE, he never wrote a letter to\r\nanybody in his life.\r\n\r\nSO FAR AS ANY ONE KNOWS, HE RECEIVED ONLY ONE LETTER DURING HIS LIFE.\r\n\r\nSo far as any one KNOWS AND CAN PROVE, Shakespeare of Stratford wrote\r\nonly one poem during his life. This one is authentic. He did write that\r\none--a fact which stands undisputed; he wrote the whole of it; he wrote\r\nthe whole of it out of his own head. He commanded that this work of art\r\nbe engraved upon his tomb, and he was obeyed. There it abides to this\r\nday. This is it:\r\n\r\nGood friend for Iesus sake forbeare To digg the dust encloased heare:\r\nBlest be ye man yt spares thes stones And curst be he yt moves my bones.\r\n\r\nIn the list as above set down will be found EVERY POSITIVELY KNOWN fact\r\nof Shakespeare's life, lean and meager as the invoice is. Beyond these\r\ndetails we know NOT A THING about him. All the rest of his vast history,\r\nas furnished by the biographers, is built up, course upon course,\r\nof guesses, inferences, theories, conjectures--an Eiffel Tower\r\nof artificialities rising sky-high from a very flat and very thin\r\nfoundation of inconsequential facts.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nConjectures\r\n\r\nThe historians \"suppose\" that Shakespeare attended the Free School in\r\nStratford from the time he was seven years old till he was thirteen.\r\nThere is no EVIDENCE in existence that he ever went to school at all.\r\n\r\nThe historians \"infer\" that he got his Latin in that school--the school\r\nwhich they \"suppose\" he attended.\r\n\r\nThey \"suppose\" his father's declining fortunes made it necessary for him\r\nto leave the school they supposed he attended, and get to work and help\r\nsupport his parents and their ten children. But there is no evidence\r\nthat he ever entered or returned from the school they suppose he\r\nattended.\r\n\r\nThey \"suppose\" he assisted his father in the butchering business; and\r\nthat, being only a boy, he didn't have to do full-grown butchering, but\r\nonly slaughtered calves. Also, that whenever he killed a calf he made a\r\nhigh-flown speech over it. This supposition rests upon the testimony\r\nof a man who wasn't there at the time; a man who got it from a man\r\nwho could have been there, but did not say whether he was nor not; and\r\nneither of them thought to mention it for decades, and decades, and\r\ndecades, and two more decades after Shakespeare's death (until old age\r\nand mental decay had refreshed and vivified their memories). They hadn't\r\ntwo facts in stock about the long-dead distinguished citizen, but only\r\njust the one: he slaughtered calves and broke into oratory while he was\r\nat it. Curious. They had only one fact, yet the distinguished citizen\r\nhad spent twenty-six years in that little town--just half his lifetime.\r\nHowever, rightly viewed, it was the most important fact, indeed almost\r\nthe only important fact, of Shakespeare's life in Stratford. Rightly\r\nviewed. For experience is an author's most valuable asset; experience\r\nis the thing that puts the muscle and the breath and the warm blood into\r\nthe book he writes. Rightly viewed, calf-butchering accounts for \"Titus\r\nAndronicus,\" the only play--ain't it?--that the Stratford Shakespeare\r\never wrote; and yet it is the only one everybody tried to chouse him out\r\nof, the Baconians included.\r\n\r\nThe historians find themselves \"justified in believing\" that the young\r\nShakespeare poached upon Sir Thomas Lucy's deer preserves and got haled\r\nbefore that magistrate for it. But there is no shred of respectworthy\r\nevidence that anything of the kind happened.\r\n\r\nThe historians, having argued the thing that MIGHT have happened into\r\nthe thing that DID happen, found no trouble in turning Sir Thomas Lucy\r\ninto Mr. Justice Shallow. They have long ago convinced the world--on\r\nsurmise and without trustworthy evidence--that Shallow IS Sir Thomas.\r\n\r\nThe next addition to the young Shakespeare's Stratford history comes\r\neasy. The historian builds it out of the surmised deer-steeling, and\r\nthe surmised trial before the magistrate, and the surmised\r\nvengeance-prompted satire upon the magistrate in the play: result, the\r\nyoung Shakespeare was a wild, wild, wild, oh, SUCH a wild young scamp,\r\nand that gratuitous slander is established for all time! It is the very\r\nway Professor Osborn and I built the colossal skeleton brontosaur\r\nthat stands fifty-seven feet long and sixteen feet high in the Natural\r\nHistory Museum, the awe and admiration of all the world, the stateliest\r\nskeleton that exists on the planet. We had nine bones, and we built the\r\nrest of him out of plaster of Paris. We ran short of plaster of Paris,\r\nor we'd have built a brontosaur that could sit down beside the Stratford\r\nShakespeare and none but an expert could tell which was biggest or\r\ncontained the most plaster.\r\n\r\nShakespeare pronounced \"Venus and Adonis\" \"the first heir of his\r\ninvention,\" apparently implying that it was his first effort at literary\r\ncomposition. He should not have said it. It has been an embarrassment to\r\nhis historians these many, many years. They have to make him write that\r\ngraceful and polished and flawless and beautiful poem before he escaped\r\nfrom Stratford and his family--1586 or '87--age, twenty-two, or along\r\nthere; because within the next five years he wrote five great plays, and\r\ncould not have found time to write another line.\r\n\r\nIt is sorely embarrassing. If he began to slaughter calves, and poach\r\ndeer, and rollick around, and learn English, at the earliest likely\r\nmoment--say at thirteen, when he was supposably wrenched from that\r\nschool where he was supposably storing up Latin for future literary\r\nuse--he had his youthful hands full, and much more than full. He must\r\nhave had to put aside his Warwickshire dialect, which wouldn't be\r\nunderstood in London, and study English very hard. Very hard indeed;\r\nincredibly hard, almost, if the result of that labor was to be the\r\nsmooth and rounded and flexible and letter-perfect English of the \"Venus\r\nand Adonis\" in the space of ten years; and at the same time learn great\r\nand fine and unsurpassable literary FORM.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is \"conjectured\" that he accomplished all this and more,\r\nmuch more: learned law and its intricacies; and the complex procedure of\r\nthe law-courts; and all about soldiering, and sailoring, and the manners\r\nand customs and ways of royal courts and aristocratic society; and\r\nlikewise accumulated in his one head every kind of knowledge the learned\r\nthen possessed, and every kind of humble knowledge possessed by the\r\nlowly and the ignorant; and added thereto a wider and more intimate\r\nknowledge of the world's great literatures, ancient and modern, than\r\nwas possessed by any other man of his time--for he was going to make\r\nbrilliant and easy and admiration-compelling use of these splendid\r\ntreasures the moment he got to London. And according to the surmisers,\r\nthat is what he did. Yes, although there was no one in Stratford able to\r\nteach him these things, and no library in the little village to dig them\r\nout of. His father could not read, and even the surmisers surmise that\r\nhe did not keep a library.\r\n\r\nIt is surmised by the biographers that the young Shakespeare got his\r\nvast knowledge of the law and his familiar and accurate acquaintance\r\nwith the manners and customs and shop-talk of lawyers through being for\r\na time the CLERK OF A STRATFORD COURT; just as a bright lad like me,\r\nreared in a village on the banks of the Mississippi, might become\r\nperfect in knowledge of the Bering Strait whale-fishery and the\r\nshop-talk of the veteran exercises of that adventure-bristling trade\r\nthrough catching catfish with a \"trot-line\" Sundays. But the surmise\r\nis damaged by the fact that there is no evidence--and not even\r\ntradition--that the young Shakespeare was ever clerk of a law-court.\r\n\r\nIt is further surmised that the young Shakespeare accumulated his\r\nlaw-treasures in the first years of his sojourn in London, through\r\n\"amusing himself\" by learning book-law in his garret and by picking up\r\nlawyer-talk and the rest of it through loitering about the law-courts\r\nand listening. But it is only surmise; there is no EVIDENCE that he\r\never did either of those things. They are merely a couple of chunks of\r\nplaster of Paris.\r\n\r\nThere is a legend that he got his bread and butter by holding horses in\r\nfront of the London theaters, mornings and afternoons. Maybe he did.\r\nIf he did, it seriously shortened his law-study hours and his\r\nrecreation-time in the courts. In those very days he was writing great\r\nplays, and needed all the time he could get. The horse-holding legend\r\nought to be strangled; it too formidably increases the historian's\r\ndifficulty in accounting for the young Shakespeare's erudition--an\r\nerudition which he was acquiring, hunk by hunk and chunk by chunk, every\r\nday in those strenuous times, and emptying each day's catch into next\r\nday's imperishable drama.\r\n\r\nHe had to acquire a knowledge of war at the same time; and a knowledge\r\nof soldier-people and sailor-people and their ways and talk; also a\r\nknowledge of some foreign lands and their languages: for he was daily\r\nemptying fluent streams of these various knowledges, too, into his\r\ndramas. How did he acquire these rich assets?\r\n\r\nIn the usual way: by surmise. It is SURMISED that he traveled in Italy\r\nand Germany and around, and qualified himself to put their scenic and\r\nsocial aspects upon paper; that he perfected himself in French, Italian,\r\nand Spanish on the road; that he went in Leicester's expedition to the\r\nLow Countries, as soldier or sutler or something, for several months or\r\nyears--or whatever length of time a surmiser needs in his business--and\r\nthus became familiar with soldiership and soldier-ways and soldier-talk\r\nand generalship and general-ways and general-talk, and seamanship and\r\nsailor-ways and sailor-talk.\r\n\r\nMaybe he did all these things, but I would like to know who held the\r\nhorses in the mean time; and who studied the books in the garret;\r\nand who frolicked in the law-courts for recreation. Also, who did the\r\ncall-boying and the play-acting.\r\n\r\nFor he became a call-boy; and as early as '93 he became a\r\n\"vagabond\"--the law's ungentle term for an unlisted actor; and in '94\r\na \"regular\" and properly and officially listed member of that (in those\r\ndays) lightly valued and not much respected profession.\r\n\r\nRight soon thereafter he became a stockholder in two theaters, and\r\nmanager of them. Thenceforward he was a busy and flourishing business\r\nman, and was raking in money with both hands for twenty years. Then in a\r\nnoble frenzy of poetic inspiration he wrote his one poem--his only poem,\r\nhis darling--and laid him down and died:\r\n\r\nGood friend for Iesus sake forbeare To digg the dust encloased heare:\r\nBlest be ye man yt spares thes stones And curst be he yt moves my bones.\r\n\r\nHe was probably dead when he wrote it. Still, this is only conjecture.\r\nWe have only circumstantial evidence. Internal evidence.\r\n\r\nShall I set down the rest of the Conjectures which constitute the\r\ngiant Biography of William Shakespeare? It would strain the Unabridged\r\nDictionary to hold them. He is a brontosaur: nine bones and six hundred\r\nbarrels of plaster of Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\"We May Assume\"\r\n\r\nIn the Assuming trade three separate and independent cults are\r\ntransacting business. Two of these cults are known as the Shakespearites\r\nand the Baconians, and I am the other one--the Brontosaurian.\r\n\r\nThe Shakespearite knows that Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare's Works; the\r\nBaconian knows that Francis Bacon wrote them; the Brontosaurian\r\ndoesn't really know which of them did it, but is quite composedly and\r\ncontentedly sure that Shakespeare DIDN'T, and strongly suspects that\r\nBacon DID. We all have to do a good deal of assuming, but I am fairly\r\ncertain that in every case I can call to mind the Baconian assumers\r\nhave come out ahead of the Shakespearites. Both parties handle the same\r\nmaterials, but the Baconians seem to me to get much more reasonable and\r\nrational and persuasive results out of them than is the case with the\r\nShakespearites. The Shakespearite conducts his assuming upon a definite\r\nprinciple, an unchanging and immutable law: which is: 2 and 8 and 7 and\r\n14, added together, make 165. I believe this to be an error. No matter,\r\nyou cannot get a habit-sodden Shakespearite to cipher-up his materials\r\nupon any other basis. With the Baconian it is different. If you place\r\nbefore him the above figures and set him to adding them up, he will\r\nnever in any case get more than 45 out of them, and in nine cases out of\r\nten he will get just the proper 31.\r\n\r\nLet me try to illustrate the two systems in a simple and homely way\r\ncalculated to bring the idea within the grasp of the ignorant and\r\nunintelligent. We will suppose a case: take a lap-bred, house-fed,\r\nuneducated, inexperienced kitten; take a rugged old Tom that's scarred\r\nfrom stem to rudder-post with the memorials of strenuous experience, and\r\nis so cultured, so educated, so limitlessly erudite that one may say of\r\nhim \"all cat-knowledge is his province\"; also, take a mouse. Lock the\r\nthree up in a holeless, crackless, exitless prison-cell. Wait half an\r\nhour, then open the cell, introduce a Shakespearite and a Baconian, and\r\nlet them cipher and assume. The mouse is missing: the question to be\r\ndecided is, where is it? You can guess both verdicts beforehand. One\r\nverdict will say the kitten contains the mouse; the other will as\r\ncertainly say the mouse is in the tom-cat.\r\n\r\nThe Shakespearite will Reason like this--(that is not my word, it is\r\nhis). He will say the kitten MAY HAVE BEEN attending school when nobody\r\nwas noticing; therefore WE ARE WARRANTED IN ASSUMING that it did so;\r\nalso, it COULD HAVE BEEN training in a court-clerk's office when no\r\none was noticing; since that could have happened, WE ARE JUSTIFIED IN\r\nASSUMING that it did happen; it COULD HAVE STUDIED CATOLOGY IN A GARRET\r\nwhen no one was noticing--therefore it DID; it COULD HAVE attended\r\ncat-assizes on the shed-roof nights, for recreation, when no one was\r\nnoticing, and have harvested a knowledge of cat court-forms and cat\r\nlawyer-talk in that way: it COULD have done it, therefore without a\r\ndoubt it DID; it COULD HAVE gone soldiering with a war-tribe when no one\r\nwas noticing, and learned soldier-wiles and soldier-ways, and what to do\r\nwith a mouse when opportunity offers; the plain inference, therefore,\r\nis that that is what it DID. Since all these manifold things COULD have\r\noccurred, we have EVERY RIGHT TO BELIEVE they did occur. These patiently\r\nand painstakingly accumulated vast acquirements and competences needed\r\nbut one thing more--opportunity--to convert themselves into triumphant\r\naction. The opportunity came, we have the result; BEYOND SHADOW OF\r\nQUESTION the mouse is in the kitten.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to remark that when we of the three cults plant a \"WE THINK\r\nWE MAY ASSUME,\" we expect it, under careful watering and fertilizing and\r\ntending, to grow up into a strong and hardy and weather-defying \"THERE\r\nISN'T A SHADOW OF A DOUBT\" at last--and it usually happens.\r\n\r\nWe know what the Baconian's verdict would be: \"THERE IS NOT A RAG\r\nOF EVIDENCE THAT THE KITTEN HAS HAD ANY TRAINING, ANY EDUCATION, ANY\r\nEXPERIENCE QUALIFYING IT FOR THE PRESENT OCCASION, OR IS INDEED EQUIPPED\r\nFOR ANY ACHIEVEMENT ABOVE LIFTING SUCH UNCLAIMED MILK AS COMES ITS WAY;\r\nBUT THERE IS ABUNDANT EVIDENCE--UNASSAILABLE PROOF, IN FACT--THAT THE\r\nOTHER ANIMAL IS EQUIPPED, TO THE LAST DETAIL, WITH EVERY QUALIFICATION\r\nNECESSARY FOR THE EVENT. WITHOUT SHADOW OF DOUBT THE TOM-CAT CONTAINS\r\nTHE MOUSE.\"\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nWhen Shakespeare died, in 1616, great literary productions attributed\r\nto him as author had been before the London world and in high favor for\r\ntwenty-four years. Yet his death was not an event. It made no stir, it\r\nattracted no attention. Apparently his eminent literary contemporaries\r\ndid not realize that a celebrated poet had passed from their midst.\r\nPerhaps they knew a play-actor of minor rank had disappeared, but\r\ndid not regard him as the author of his Works. \"We are justified in\r\nassuming\" this.\r\n\r\nHis death was not even an event in the little town of Stratford. Does\r\nthis mean that in Stratford he was not regarded as a celebrity of ANY\r\nkind?\r\n\r\n\"We are privileged to assume\"--no, we are indeed OBLIGED to assume--that\r\nsuch was the case. He had spent the first twenty-two or twenty-three\r\nyears of his life there, and of course knew everybody and was known by\r\neverybody of that day in the town, including the dogs and the cats and\r\nthe horses. He had spent the last five or six years of his life there,\r\ndiligently trading in every big and little thing that had money in it;\r\nso we are compelled to assume that many of the folk there in those said\r\nlatter days knew him personally, and the rest by sight and hearsay.\r\nBut not as a CELEBRITY? Apparently not. For everybody soon forgot to\r\nremember any contact with him or any incident connected with him. The\r\ndozens of townspeople, still alive, who had known of him or known\r\nabout him in the first twenty-three years of his life were in the same\r\nunremembering condition: if they knew of any incident connected with\r\nthat period of his life they didn't tell about it. Would they if they had\r\nbeen asked? It is most likely. Were they asked? It is pretty apparent\r\nthat they were not. Why weren't they? It is a very plausible guess that\r\nnobody there or elsewhere was interested to know.\r\n\r\nFor seven years after Shakespeare's death nobody seems to have been\r\ninterested in him. Then the quarto was published, and Ben Jonson awoke\r\nout of his long indifference and sang a song of praise and put it in the\r\nfront of the book. Then silence fell AGAIN.\r\n\r\nFor sixty years. Then inquiries into Shakespeare's Stratford life began\r\nto be made, of Stratfordians. Of Stratfordians who had known Shakespeare\r\nor had seen him? No. Then of Stratfordians who had seen people who\r\nhad known or seen people who had seen Shakespeare? No. Apparently the\r\ninquires were only made of Stratfordians who were not Stratfordians of\r\nShakespeare's day, but later comers; and what they had learned had come\r\nto them from persons who had not seen Shakespeare; and what they had\r\nlearned was not claimed as FACT, but only as legend--dim and fading and\r\nindefinite legend; legend of the calf-slaughtering rank, and not worth\r\nremembering either as history or fiction.\r\n\r\nHas it ever happened before--or since--that a celebrated person who had\r\nspent exactly half of a fairly long life in the village where he was\r\nborn and reared, was able to slip out of this world and leave that\r\nvillage voiceless and gossipless behind him--utterly voiceless., utterly\r\ngossipless? And permanently so? I don't believe it has happened in any\r\ncase except Shakespeare's. And couldn't and wouldn't have happened\r\nin his case if he had been regarded as a celebrity at the time of his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nWhen I examine my own case--but let us do that, and see if it will not\r\nbe recognizable as exhibiting a condition of things quite likely to\r\nresult, most likely to result, indeed substantially SURE to result in\r\nthe case of a celebrated person, a benefactor of the human race. Like\r\nme.\r\n\r\nMy parents brought me to the village of Hannibal, Missouri, on the\r\nbanks of the Mississippi, when I was two and a half years old. I entered\r\nschool at five years of age, and drifted from one school to another in\r\nthe village during nine and a half years. Then my father died, leaving\r\nhis family in exceedingly straitened circumstances; wherefore my\r\nbook-education came to a standstill forever, and I became a printer's\r\napprentice, on board and clothes, and when the clothes failed I got a\r\nhymn-book in place of them. This for summer wear, probably. I lived in\r\nHannibal fifteen and a half years, altogether, then ran away, according\r\nto the custom of persons who are intending to become celebrated. I\r\nnever lived there afterward. Four years later I became a \"cub\" on a\r\nMississippi steamboat in the St. Louis and New Orleans trade, and\r\nafter a year and a half of hard study and hard work the U.S. inspectors\r\nrigorously examined me through a couple of long sittings and decided\r\nthat I knew every inch of the Mississippi--thirteen hundred miles--in\r\nthe dark and in the day--as well as a baby knows the way to its mother's\r\npaps day or night. So they licensed me as a pilot--knighted me, so to\r\nspeak--and I rose up clothed with authority, a responsible servant of\r\nthe United States Government.\r\n\r\nNow then. Shakespeare died young--he was only fifty-two. He had lived in\r\nhis native village twenty-six years, or about that. He died celebrated\r\n(if you believe everything you read in the books). Yet when he died\r\nnobody there or elsewhere took any notice of it; and for sixty years\r\nafterward no townsman remembered to say anything about him or about\r\nhis life in Stratford. When the inquirer came at last he got but one\r\nfact--no, LEGEND--and got that one at second hand, from a person who\r\nhad only heard it as a rumor and didn't claim copyright in it as a\r\nproduction of his own. He couldn't, very well, for its date antedated\r\nhis own birth-date. But necessarily a number of persons were still\r\nalive in Stratford who, in the days of their youth, had seen Shakespeare\r\nnearly every day in the last five years of his life, and they would have\r\nbeen able to tell that inquirer some first-hand things about him if\r\nhe had in those last days been a celebrity and therefore a person of\r\ninterest to the villagers. Why did not the inquirer hunt them up and\r\ninterview them? Wasn't it worth while? Wasn't the matter of sufficient\r\nconsequence? Had the inquirer an engagement to see a dog-fight and\r\ncouldn't spare the time?\r\n\r\nIt all seems to mean that he never had any literary celebrity, there or\r\nelsewhere, and no considerable repute as actor and manager.\r\n\r\nNow then, I am away along in life--my seventy-third year being already\r\nwell behind me--yet SIXTEEN of my Hannibal schoolmates are still\r\nalive today, and can tell--and do tell--inquirers dozens and dozens of\r\nincidents of their young lives and mine together; things that happened\r\nto us in the morning of life, in the blossom of our youth, in the good\r\ndays, the dear days, \"the days when we went gipsying, a long time ago.\"\r\nMost of them creditable to me, too. One child to whom I paid court when\r\nshe was five years old and I eight still lives in Hannibal, and she\r\nvisited me last summer, traversing the necessary ten or twelve hundred\r\nmiles of railroad without damage to her patience or to her old-young\r\nvigor. Another little lassie to whom I paid attention in Hannibal when\r\nshe was nine years old and I the same, is still alive--in\r\nLondon--and hale and hearty, just as I am. And on the few surviving\r\nsteamboats--those lingering ghosts and remembrancers of great fleets\r\nthat plied the big river in the beginning of my water-career--which\r\nis exactly as long ago as the whole invoice of the life-years of\r\nShakespeare numbers--there are still findable two or three river-pilots\r\nwho saw me do creditable things in those ancient days; and several\r\nwhite-headed engineers; and several roustabouts and mates; and several\r\ndeck-hands who used to heave the lead for me and send up on the\r\nstill night the \"Six--feet--SCANT!\" that made me shudder, and the\r\n\"M-a-r-k--TWAIN!\" that took the shudder away, and presently the darling\r\n\"By the d-e-e-p--FOUR!\" that lifted me to heaven for joy. (1) They know\r\nabout me, and can tell. And so do printers, from St. Louis to New York;\r\nand so do newspaper reporters, from Nevada to San Francisco. And so\r\ndo the police. If Shakespeare had really been celebrated, like me,\r\nStratford could have told things about him; and if my experience goes\r\nfor anything, they'd have done it.\r\n\r\n      1.  Four fathoms--twenty-four feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nIf I had under my superintendence a controversy appointed to decide\r\nwhether Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare or not, I believe I would place\r\nbefore the debaters only the one question, WAS SHAKESPEARE EVER A\r\nPRACTICING LAWYER? and leave everything else out.\r\n\r\nIt is maintained that the man who wrote the plays was not merely\r\nmyriad-minded, but also myriad-accomplished: that he not only knew some\r\nthousands of things about human life in all its shades and grades, and\r\nabout the hundred arts and trades and crafts and professions which\r\nmen busy themselves in, but that he could TALK about the men and their\r\ngrades and trades accurately, making no mistakes. Maybe it is so, but\r\nhave the experts spoken, or is it only Tom, Dick, and Harry? Does the\r\nexhibit stand upon wide, and loose, and eloquent generalizing--which is\r\nnot evidence, and not proof--or upon details, particulars, statistics,\r\nillustrations, demonstrations?\r\n\r\nExperts of unchallengeable authority have testified definitely as to\r\nonly one of Shakespeare's multifarious craft-equipments, so far as\r\nmy recollections of Shakespeare-Bacon talk abide with me--his\r\nlaw-equipment. I do not remember that Wellington or Napoleon ever\r\nexamined Shakespeare's battles and sieges and strategies, and then\r\ndecided and established for good and all that they were militarily\r\nflawless; I do not remember that any Nelson, or Drake, or Cook ever\r\nexamined his seamanship and said it showed profound and accurate\r\nfamiliarity with that art; I don't remember that any king or prince\r\nor duke has ever testified that Shakespeare was letter-perfect in\r\nhis handling of royal court-manners and the talk and manners of\r\naristocracies; I don't remember that any illustrious Latinist or Grecian\r\nor Frenchman or Spaniard or Italian has proclaimed him a past-master in\r\nthose languages; I don't remember--well, I don't remember that there\r\nis TESTIMONY--great testimony--imposing testimony--unanswerable and\r\nunattackable testimony as to any of Shakespeare's hundred specialties,\r\nexcept one--the law.\r\n\r\nOther things change, with time, and the student cannot trace back\r\nwith certainty the changes that various trades and their processes and\r\ntechnicalities have undergone in the long stretch of a century or two\r\nand find out what their processes and technicalities were in those early\r\ndays, but with the law it is different: it is mile-stoned and documented\r\nall the way back, and the master of that wonderful trade, that complex\r\nand intricate trade, that awe-compelling trade, has competent ways of\r\nknowing whether Shakespeare-law is good law or not; and whether his\r\nlaw-court procedure is correct or not, and whether his legal shop-talk\r\nis the shop-talk of a veteran practitioner or only a machine-made\r\ncounterfeit of it gathered from books and from occasional loiterings in\r\nWestminster.\r\n\r\nRichard H. Dana served two years before the mast, and had every\r\nexperience that falls to the lot of the sailor before the mast of our\r\nday. His sailor-talk flows from his pen with the sure touch and the ease\r\nand confidence of a person who has LIVED what he is talking about, not\r\ngathered it from books and random listenings. Hear him:\r\n\r\nHaving hove short, cast off the gaskets, and made the bunt of each\r\nsail fast by the jigger, with a man on each yard, at the word the whole\r\ncanvas of the ship was loosed, and with the greatest rapidity possible\r\neverything was sheeted home and hoisted up, the anchor tripped and\r\ncat-headed, and the ship under headway.\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\nThe royal yards were all crossed at once, and royals and sky-sails\r\nset, and, as we had the wind free, the booms were run out, and all were\r\naloft, active as cats, laying out on the yards and booms, reeving the\r\nstudding-sail gear; and sail after sail the captain piled upon her,\r\nuntil she was covered with canvas, her sails looking like a great white\r\ncloud resting upon a black speck.\r\n\r\nOnce more. A race in the Pacific:\r\n\r\nOur antagonist was in her best trim. Being clear of the point, the\r\nbreeze became stiff, and the royal-masts bent under our sails, but we\r\nwould not take them in until we saw three boys spring into the rigging\r\nof the CALIFORNIA; then they were all furled at once, but with orders\r\nto our boys to stay aloft at the top-gallant mast-heads and loose them\r\nagain at the word. It was my duty to furl the fore-royal; and while\r\nstanding by to loose it again, I had a fine view of the scene. From\r\nwhere I stood, the two vessels seemed nothing but spars and sails, while\r\ntheir narrow decks, far below, slanting over by the force of the wind\r\naloft, appeared hardly capable of supporting the great fabrics\r\nraised upon them. The CALIFORNIA was to windward of us, and had every\r\nadvantage; yet, while the breeze was stiff we held our own. As soon as\r\nit began to slacken she ranged a little ahead, and the order was given\r\nto loose the royals. In an instant the gaskets were off and the bunt\r\ndropped. \"Sheet home the fore-royal!\"--\"Weather sheet's home!\"--\"Lee\r\nsheet's home!\"--\"Hoist away, sir!\" is bawled from aloft. \"Overhaul your\r\nclew-lines!\" shouts the mate. \"Aye-aye, sir, all clear!\"--\"Taut leech!\r\nbelay! Well the lee brace; haul taut to windward!\" and the royals are\r\nset.\r\n\r\nWhat would the captain of any sailing-vessel of our time say to that?\r\nHe would say, \"The man that wrote that didn't learn his trade out of a\r\nbook, he has BEEN there!\" But would this same captain be competent to\r\nsit in judgment upon Shakespeare's seamanship--considering the changes\r\nin ships and ship-talk that have necessarily taken place, unrecorded,\r\nunremembered, and lost to history in the last three hundred years? It\r\nis my conviction that Shakespeare's sailor-talk would be Choctaw to him.\r\nFor instance--from \"The Tempest\":\r\n\r\nMASTER. Boatswain!\r\n\r\nBOATSWAIN. Here, master; what cheer?\r\n\r\nMASTER. Good, speak to the mariners: fall to 't, yarely, or we run\r\nourselves to ground; bestir, bestir! (ENTER MARINERS.)\r\n\r\nBOATSWAIN. Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! yare, yare!\r\nTake in the topsail. Tend to the master's whistle.... Down with the\r\ntopmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring her to try wi' the main course....\r\nLay her a-hold, a-hold! Set her two courses. Off to sea again; lay her\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThat will do, for the present; let us yare a little, now, for a change.\r\n\r\nIf a man should write a book and in it make one of his characters\r\nsay, \"Here, devil, empty the quoins into the standing galley and the\r\nimposing-stone into the hell-box; assemble the comps around the frisket\r\nand let them jeff for takes and be quick about it,\" I should recognize a\r\nmistake or two in the phrasing, and would know that the writer was only\r\na printer theoretically, not practically.\r\n\r\nI have been a quartz miner in the silver regions--a pretty hard life; I\r\nknow all the palaver of that business: I know all about discovery\r\nclaims and the subordinate claims; I know all about lodes, ledges,\r\noutcroppings, dips, spurs, angles, shafts, drifts, inclines, levels,\r\ntunnels, air-shafts, \"horses,\" clay casings, granite casings; quartz\r\nmills and their batteries; arastras, and how to charge them with\r\nquicksilver and sulphate of copper; and how to clean them up, and how to\r\nreduce the resulting amalgam in the retorts, and how to cast the bullion\r\ninto pigs; and finally I know how to screen tailings, and also how to\r\nhunt for something less robust to do, and find it. I know the argot of\r\nthe quartz-mining and milling industry familiarly; and so whenever Bret\r\nHarte introduces that industry into a story, the first time one of his\r\nminers opens his mouth I recognize from his phrasing that Harte got the\r\nphrasing by listening--like Shakespeare--I mean the Stratford one--not\r\nby experience. No one can talk the quartz dialect correctly without\r\nlearning it with pick and shovel and drill and fuse.\r\n\r\nI have been a surface miner--gold--and I know all its mysteries, and\r\nthe dialect that belongs with them; and whenever Harte introduces that\r\nindustry into a story I know by the phrasing of his characters that\r\nneither he nor they have ever served that trade.\r\n\r\nI have been a \"pocket\" miner--a sort of gold mining not findable in any\r\nbut one little spot in the world, so far as I know. I know how, with\r\nhorn and water, to find the trail of a pocket and trace it step by step\r\nand stage by stage up the mountain to its source, and find the compact\r\nlittle nest of yellow metal reposing in its secret home under the\r\nground. I know the language of that trade, that capricious trade, that\r\nfascinating buried-treasure trade, and can catch any writer who tries to\r\nuse it without having learned it by the sweat of his brow and the labor\r\nof his hands.\r\n\r\nI know several other trades and the argot that goes with them; and\r\nwhenever a person tries to talk the talk peculiar to any of them without\r\nhaving learned it at its source I can trap him always before he gets far\r\non his road.\r\n\r\nAnd so, as I have already remarked, if I were required to superintend a\r\nBacon-Shakespeare controversy, I would narrow the matter down to a\r\nsingle question--the only one, so far as the previous controversies have\r\ninformed me, concerning which illustrious experts of unimpeachable\r\ncompetency have testified: WAS THE AUTHOR OF SHAKESPEARE'S WORKS A\r\nLAWYER?--a lawyer deeply read and of limitless experience? I would put\r\naside the guesses and surmises, and perhapses, and might-have-beens, and\r\ncould-have-beens, and must-have-beens, and,\r\nwe-are-justified-in-presumings,and the rest of those vague specters and\r\nshadows and indefinitenesses, and stand or fall, win or lose, by the\r\nverdict rendered by the jury upon that single question. If the verdict\r\nwas Yes, I should feel quite convinced that the Stratford Shakespeare,\r\nthe actor, manager, and trader who died so obscure, so forgotten, so\r\ndestitute of even village consequence, that sixty years afterward no\r\nfellow-citizen and friend of his later days remembered to tell anything\r\nabout him, did not write the Works.\r\n\r\nChapter XIII of THE SHAKESPEARE PROBLEM RESTATED bears the heading\r\n\"Shakespeare as a Lawyer,\" and comprises some fifty pages of expert\r\ntestimony, with comments thereon, and I will copy the first nine, as\r\nbeing sufficient all by themselves, as it seems to me, to settle\r\nthe question which I have conceived to be the master-key to the\r\nShakespeare-Bacon puzzle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nShakespeare as a Lawyer (1)\r\n\r\nThe Plays and Poems of Shakespeare supply ample evidence that their\r\nauthor not only had a very extensive and accurate knowledge of law, but\r\nthat he was well acquainted with the manners and customs of members of\r\nthe Inns of Court and with legal life generally.\r\n\r\n\"While novelists and dramatists are constantly making mistakes as to\r\nthe laws of marriage, of wills, and inheritance, to Shakespeare's law,\r\nlavishly as he expounds it, there can neither be demurrer, nor bill of\r\nexceptions, nor writ of error.\" Such was the testimony borne by one of\r\nthe most distinguished lawyers of the nineteenth century who was raised\r\nto the high office of Lord Chief Justice in 1850, and subsequently\r\nbecame Lord Chancellor. Its weight will, doubtless, be more appreciated\r\nby lawyers than by laymen, for only lawyers know how impossible it is\r\nfor those who have not served an apprenticeship to the law to avoid\r\ndisplaying their ignorance if they venture to employ legal terms and\r\nto discuss legal doctrines. \"There is nothing so dangerous,\" wrote Lord\r\nCampbell, \"as for one not of the craft to tamper with our freemasonry.\"\r\nA layman is certain to betray himself by using some expression which a\r\nlawyer would never employ. Mr. Sidney Lee himself supplies us with an\r\nexample of this. He writes (p. 164): \"On February 15, 1609, Shakespeare\r\n... obtained judgment from a jury against Addenbroke for the payment of\r\nNo. 6, and No. 1, 5s. 0d. costs.\" Now a lawyer would never have spoken\r\nof obtaining \"judgment from a jury,\" for it is the function of a jury\r\nnot to deliver judgment (which is the prerogative of the court), but to\r\nfind a verdict on the facts. The error is, indeed, a venial one, but it\r\nis just one of those little things which at once enable a lawyer to know\r\nif the writer is a layman or \"one of the craft.\"\r\n\r\nBut when a layman ventures to plunge deeply into legal subjects, he\r\nis naturally apt to make an exhibition of his incompetence. \"Let a\r\nnon-professional man, however acute,\" writes Lord Campbell again,\r\n\"presume to talk law, or to draw illustrations from legal science in\r\ndiscussing other subjects, and he will speedily fall into laughable\r\nabsurdity.\"\r\n\r\nAnd what does the same high authority say about Shakespeare? He had \"a\r\ndeep technical knowledge of the law,\" and an easy familiarity with \"some\r\nof the most abstruse proceedings in English jurisprudence.\" And again:\r\n\"Whenever he indulges this propensity he uniformly lays down good law.\"\r\nOf \"Henry IV.,\" Part 2, he says: \"If Lord Eldon could be supposed to\r\nhave written the play, I do not see how he could be chargeable with\r\nhaving forgotten any of his law while writing it.\" Charles and Mary\r\nCowden Clarke speak of \"the marvelous intimacy which he displays with\r\nlegal terms, his frequent adoption of them in illustration, and his\r\ncuriously technical knowledge of their form and force.\" Malone, himself\r\na lawyer, wrote: \"His knowledge of legal terms is not merely such\r\nas might be acquired by the casual observation of even his\r\nall-comprehending mind; it has the appearance of technical skill.\"\r\nAnother lawyer and well-known Shakespearean, Richard Grant White, says:\r\n\"No dramatist of the time, not even Beaumont, who was the younger son of\r\na judge of the Common Pleas, and who after studying in the Inns of\r\nCourt abandoned law for the drama, used legal phrases with Shakespeare's\r\nreadiness and exactness. And the significance of this fact is heightened\r\nby another, that it is only to the language of the law that he exhibits\r\nthis inclination. The phrases peculiar to other occupations serve him\r\non rare occasions by way of description, comparison, or illustration,\r\ngenerally when something in the scene suggests them, but legal phrases\r\nflow from his pen as part of his vocabulary and parcel of his thought.\r\nTake the word 'purchase' for instance, which, in ordinary use, means\r\nto acquire by giving value, but applies in law to all legal modes\r\nof obtaining property except by inheritance or descent, and in this\r\npeculiar sense the word occurs five times in Shakespeare's thirty-four\r\nplays, and only in one single instance in the fifty-four plays of\r\nBeaumont and Fletcher. It has been suggested that it was in attendance\r\nupon the courts in London that he picked up his legal vocabulary. But\r\nthis supposition not only fails to account for Shakespeare's peculiar\r\nfreedom and exactness in the use of that phraseology, it does not even\r\nplace him in the way of learning those terms his use of which is most\r\nremarkable, which are not such as he would have heard at ordinary\r\nproceedings at NISI PRIUS, but such as refer to the tenure or transfer\r\nof real property, 'fine and recovery,' 'statutes merchant,' 'purchase,'\r\n'indenture,' 'tenure,' 'double voucher,' 'fee simple,' 'fee farm,'\r\n'remainder,' 'reversion,' 'forfeiture,' etc. This conveyancer's jargon\r\ncould not have been picked up by hanging round the courts of law in\r\nLondon two hundred and fifty years ago, when suits as to the title of\r\nreal property were comparatively rare. And besides, Shakespeare uses\r\nhis law just as freely in his first plays, written in his first London\r\nyears, as in those produced at a later period. Just as exactly, too; for\r\nthe correctness and propriety with which these terms are introduced have\r\ncompelled the admiration of a Chief Justice and a Lord Chancellor.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Davis wrote: \"We seem to have something more than a sciolist's\r\ntemerity of indulgence in the terms of an unfamiliar art. No legal\r\nsolecisms will be found. The abstrusest elements of the common law are\r\nimpressed into a disciplined service. Over and over again, where such\r\nknowledge is unexampled in writers unlearned in the law, Shakespeare\r\nappears in perfect possession of it. In the law of real property, its\r\nrules of tenure and descents, its entails, its fines and recoveries,\r\ntheir vouchers and double vouchers, in the procedure of the Courts, the\r\nmethod of bringing writs and arrests, the nature of actions, the\r\nrules of pleading, the law of escapes and of contempt of court, in\r\nthe principles of evidence, both technical and philosophical, in the\r\ndistinction between the temporal and spiritual tribunals, in the law of\r\nattainder and forfeiture, in the requisites of a valid marriage, in the\r\npresumption of legitimacy, in the learning of the law of prerogative,\r\nin the inalienable character of the Crown, this mastership appears with\r\nsurprising authority.\"\r\n\r\nTo all this testimony (and there is much more which I have not cited)\r\nmay now be added that of a great lawyer of our own times, VIZ.: Sir\r\nJames Plaisted Wilde, Q.C. 1855, created a Baron of the Exchequer in\r\n1860, promoted to the post of Judge-Ordinary and Judge of the Courts\r\nof Probate and Divorce in 1863, and better known to the world as Lord\r\nPenzance, to which dignity he was raised in 1869. Lord Penzance, as all\r\nlawyers know, and as the late Mr. Inderwick, K.C., has testified,\r\nwas one of the first legal authorities of his day, famous for his\r\n\"remarkable grasp of legal principles,\" and \"endowed by nature with a\r\nremarkable facility for marshaling facts, and for a clear expression of\r\nhis views.\"\r\n\r\nLord Penzance speaks of Shakespeare's \"perfect familiarity with not only\r\nthe principles, axioms, and maxims, but the technicalities of English\r\nlaw, a knowledge so perfect and intimate that he was never incorrect\r\nand never at fault.... The mode in which this knowledge was pressed\r\ninto service on all occasions to express his meaning and illustrate his\r\nthoughts was quite unexampled. He seems to have had a special pleasure\r\nin his complete and ready mastership of it in all its branches. As\r\nmanifested in the plays, this legal knowledge and learning had therefore\r\na special character which places it on a wholly different footing from\r\nthe rest of the multifarious knowledge which is exhibited in page after\r\npage of the plays. At every turn and point at which the author required\r\na metaphor, simile, or illustration, his mind ever turned FIRST to the\r\nlaw. He seems almost to have THOUGHT in legal phrases, the commonest\r\nof legal expressions were ever at the end of his pen in description or\r\nillustration. That he should have descanted in lawyer language when\r\nhe had a forensic subject in hand, such as Shylock's bond, was to be\r\nexpected, but the knowledge of law in 'Shakespeare' was exhibited in a\r\nfar different manner: it protruded itself on all occasions, appropriate\r\nor inappropriate, and mingled itself with strains of thought widely\r\ndivergent from forensic subjects.\" Again: \"To acquire a perfect\r\nfamiliarity with legal principles, and an accurate and ready use of the\r\ntechnical terms and phrases not only of the conveyancer's office, but of\r\nthe pleader's chambers and the Courts at Westminster, nothing short\r\nof employment in some career involving constant contact with legal\r\nquestions and general legal work would be requisite. But a continuous\r\nemployment involves the element of time, and time was just what the\r\nmanager of two theaters had not at his disposal. In what portion of\r\nShakespeare's (i.e., Shakspere's) career would it be possible to point\r\nout that time could be found for the interposition of a legal employment\r\nin the chambers or offices of practicing lawyers?\"\r\n\r\nStratfordians, as is well known, casting about for some possible\r\nexplanation of Shakespeare's extraordinary knowledge of law, have made\r\nthe suggestion that Shakespeare might, conceivably, have been a clerk in\r\nan attorney's office before he came to London. Mr. Collier wrote to Lord\r\nCampbell to ask his opinion as to the probability of this being true.\r\nHis answer was as follows: \"You require us to believe implicitly a\r\nfact, of which, if true, positive and irrefragable evidence in his own\r\nhandwriting might have been forthcoming to establish it. Not having been\r\nactually enrolled as an attorney, neither the records of the local court\r\nat Stratford nor of the superior Courts at Westminster would present\r\nhis name as being concerned in any suit as an attorney, but it might\r\nreasonably have been expected that there would be deeds or wills\r\nwitnessed by him still extant, and after a very diligent search none\r\nsuch can be discovered.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this Lord Penzance comments: \"It cannot be doubted that Lord\r\nCampbell was right in this. No young man could have been at work in\r\nan attorney's office without being called upon continually to act as a\r\nwitness, and in many other ways leaving traces of his work and\r\nname.\" There is not a single fact or incident in all that is known of\r\nShakespeare, even by rumor or tradition, which supports this notion of\r\na clerkship. And after much argument and surmise which has been indulged\r\nin on this subject, we may, I think, safely put the notion on one side,\r\nfor no less an authority than Mr. Grant White says finally that the idea\r\nof his having been clerk to an attorney has been \"blown to pieces.\"\r\n\r\nIt is altogether characteristic of Mr. Churton Collins that he,\r\nnevertheless, adopts this exploded myth. \"That Shakespeare was in early\r\nlife employed as a clerk in an attorney's office may be correct. At\r\nStratford there was by royal charter a Court of Record sitting every\r\nfortnight, with six attorneys, besides the town clerk, belonging to it,\r\nand it is certainly not straining probability to suppose that the young\r\nShakespeare may have had employment in one of them. There is, it is\r\ntrue, no tradition to this effect, but such traditions as we have about\r\nShakespeare's occupation between the time of leaving school and going\r\nto London are so loose and baseless that no confidence can be placed\r\nin them. It is, to say the least, more probable that he was in an\r\nattorney's office than that he was a butcher killing calves 'in a high\r\nstyle,' and making speeches over them.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a charming specimen of Stratfordian argument. There is, as\r\nwe have seen, a very old tradition that Shakespeare was a butcher's\r\napprentice. John Dowdall, who made a tour in Warwickshire in 1693,\r\ntestifies to it as coming from the old clerk who showed him over\r\nthe church, and it is unhesitatingly accepted as true by Mr.\r\nHalliwell-Phillipps. (Vol. I, p. 11, and Vol. II, pp. 71, 72.) Mr.\r\nSidney Lee sees nothing improbable in it, and it is supported by Aubrey,\r\nwho must have written his account some time before 1680, when his\r\nmanuscript was completed. Of the attorney's clerk hypothesis, on the\r\nother hand, there is not the faintest vestige of a tradition. It\r\nhas been evolved out of the fertile imaginations of embarrassed\r\nStratfordians, seeking for some explanation of the Stratford rustic's\r\nmarvelous acquaintance with law and legal terms and legal life. But\r\nMr. Churton Collins has not the least hesitation in throwing over the\r\ntradition which has the warrant of antiquity and setting up in its\r\nstead this ridiculous invention, for which not only is there no shred of\r\npositive evidence, but which, as Lord Campbell and Lord Penzance point\r\nout, is really put out of court by the negative evidence, since \"no\r\nyoung man could have been at work in an attorney's office without being\r\ncalled upon continually to act as a witness, and in many other ways\r\nleaving traces of his work and name.\" And as Mr. Edwards further points\r\nout, since the day when Lord Campbell's book was published (between\r\nforty and fifty years ago), \"every old deed or will, to say nothing of\r\nother legal papers, dated during the period of William Shakespeare's\r\nyouth, has been scrutinized over half a dozen shires, and not one\r\nsignature of the young man has been found.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, if Shakespeare had served as clerk in an attorney's office it\r\nis clear that he must have so served for a considerable period in order to\r\nhave gained (if, indeed, it is credible that he could have so gained)\r\nhis remarkable knowledge of the law. Can we then for a moment believe\r\nthat, if this had been so, tradition would have been absolutely silent\r\non the matter? That Dowdall's old clerk, over eighty years of age,\r\nshould have never heard of it (though he was sure enough about the\r\nbutcher's apprentice) and that all the other ancient witnesses should be\r\nin similar ignorance!\r\n\r\nBut such are the methods of Stratfordian controversy. Tradition is to be\r\nscouted when it is found inconvenient, but cited as irrefragable truth\r\nwhen it suits the case. Shakespeare of Stratford was the author of the\r\nPlays and Poems, but the author of the Plays and Poems could not have\r\nbeen a butcher's apprentice. Away, therefore, with tradition. But\r\nthe author of the Plays and Poems MUST have had a very large and a very\r\naccurate knowledge of the law. Therefore, Shakespeare of Stratford\r\nmust have been an attorney's clerk! The method is simplicity itself. By\r\nsimilar reasoning Shakespeare has been made a country schoolmaster, a\r\nsoldier, a physician, a printer, and a good many other things besides,\r\naccording to the inclination and the exigencies of the commentator. It\r\nwould not be in the least surprising to find that he was studying Latin\r\nas a schoolmaster and law in an attorney's office at the same time.\r\n\r\nHowever, we must do Mr. Collins the justice of saying that he has fully\r\nrecognized, what is indeed tolerably obvious, that Shakespeare must have\r\nhad a sound legal training. \"It may, of course, be urged,\" he writes,\r\n\"that Shakespeare's knowledge of medicine, and particularly that branch\r\nof it which related to morbid psychology, is equally remarkable, and\r\nthat no one has ever contended that he was a physician. (Here Mr.\r\nCollins is wrong; that contention also has been put forward.) It may be\r\nurged that his acquaintance with the technicalities of other crafts\r\nand callings, notably of marine and military affairs, was also\r\nextraordinary, and yet no one has suspected him of being a sailor or\r\na soldier. (Wrong again. Why, even Messrs. Garnett and Gosse \"suspect\"\r\nthat he was a soldier!) This may be conceded, but the concession\r\nhardly furnishes an analogy. To these and all other subjects he recurs\r\noccasionally, and in season, but with reminiscences of the law his\r\nmemory, as is abundantly clear, was simply saturated. In season and out\r\nof season now in manifest, now in recondite application, he presses it\r\ninto the service of expression and illustration. At least a third of his\r\nmyriad metaphors are derived from it. It would indeed be difficult to\r\nfind a single act in any of his dramas, nay, in some of them, a single\r\nscene, the diction and imagery of which are not colored by it. Much of\r\nhis law may have been acquired from three books easily accessible to\r\nhim--namely, Tottell's PRECEDENTS (1572), Pulton's STATUTES (1578), and\r\nFraunce's LAWIER'S LOGIKE (1588), works with which he certainly seems to\r\nhave been familiar; but much of it could only have come from one who had\r\nan intimate acquaintance with legal proceedings. We quite agree with Mr.\r\nCastle that Shakespeare's legal knowledge is not what could have been\r\npicked up in an attorney's office, but could only have been learned\r\nby an actual attendance at the Courts, at a Pleader's Chambers, and\r\non circuit, or by associating intimately with members of the Bench and\r\nBar.\"\r\n\r\nThis is excellent. But what is Mr. Collins's explanation? \"Perhaps the\r\nsimplest solution of the problem is to accept the hypothesis that in\r\nearly life he was in an attorney's office (!), that he there contracted\r\na love for the law which never left him, that as a young man in London\r\nhe continued to study or dabble in it for his amusement, to stroll in\r\nleisure hours into the Courts, and to frequent the society of lawyers.\r\nOn no other supposition is it possible to explain the attraction which\r\nthe law evidently had for him, and his minute and undeviating accuracy\r\nin a subject where no layman who has indulged in such copious and\r\nostentatious display of legal technicalities has ever yet succeeded in\r\nkeeping himself from tripping.\"\r\n\r\nA lame conclusion. \"No other supposition\" indeed! Yes, there is another,\r\nand a very obvious supposition--namely, that Shakespeare was himself a\r\nlawyer, well versed in his trade, versed in all the ways of the courts,\r\nand living in close intimacy with judges and members of the Inns of\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nOne is, of course, thankful that Mr. Collins has appreciated the fact\r\nthat Shakespeare must have had a sound legal training, but I may\r\nbe forgiven if I do not attach quite so much importance to his\r\npronouncements on this branch of the subject as to those of Malone,\r\nLord Campbell, Judge Holmes, Mr. Castle, K.C., Lord Penzance, Mr. Grant\r\nWhite, and other lawyers, who have expressed their opinion on the matter\r\nof Shakespeare's legal acquirements....\r\n\r\nHere it may, perhaps, be worth while to quote again from Lord Penzance's\r\nbook as to the suggestion that Shakespeare had somehow or other managed\r\n\"to acquire a perfect familiarity with legal principles, and an accurate\r\nand ready use of the technical terms and phrases, not only of the\r\nconveyancer's office, but of the pleader's chambers and the Courts at\r\nWestminster.\" This, as Lord Penzance points out, \"would require nothing\r\nshort of employment in some career involving CONSTANT CONTACT with legal\r\nquestions and general legal work.\" But \"in what portion of Shakespeare's\r\ncareer would it be possible to point out that time could be found for\r\nthe interposition of a legal employment in the chambers or offices of\r\npracticing lawyers?... It is beyond doubt that at an early period he was\r\ncalled upon to abandon his attendance at school and assist his father,\r\nand was soon after, at the age of sixteen, bound apprentice to a trade.\r\nWhile under the obligation of this bond he could not have pursued any\r\nother employment. Then he leaves Stratford and comes to London. He has\r\nto provide himself with the means of a livelihood, and this he did in\r\nsome capacity at the theater. No one doubts that. The holding of horses\r\nis scouted by many, and perhaps with justice, as being unlikely and\r\ncertainly unproved; but whatever the nature of his employment was at\r\nthe theater, there is hardly room for the belief that it could have been\r\nother than continuous, for his progress there was so rapid. Ere long he\r\nhad been taken into the company as an actor, and was soon spoken of as a\r\n'Johannes Factotum.' His rapid accumulation of wealth speaks volumes for\r\nthe constancy and activity of his services. One fails to see when there\r\ncould be a break in the current of his life at this period of it, giving\r\nroom or opportunity for legal or indeed any other employment. 'In 1589,'\r\nsays Knight, 'we have undeniable evidence that he had not only a casual\r\nengagement, was not only a salaried servant, as many players were, but\r\nwas a shareholder in the company of the Queen's players with other\r\nshareholders below him on the list.' This (1589) would be within\r\ntwo years after his arrival in London, which is placed by White and\r\nHalliwell-Phillipps about the year 1587. The difficulty in supposing\r\nthat, starting with a state of ignorance in 1587, when he is supposed\r\nto have come to London, he was induced to enter upon a course of most\r\nextended study and mental culture, is almost insuperable. Still it was\r\nphysically possible, provided always that he could have had access to\r\nthe needful books. But this legal training seems to me to stand on a\r\ndifferent footing. It is not only unaccountable and incredible, but it\r\nis actually negatived by the known facts of his career.\" Lord Penzance\r\nthen refers to the fact that \"by 1592 (according to the best authority,\r\nMr. Grant White) several of the plays had been written. 'The Comedy\r\nof Errors' in 1589, 'Love's Labour's Lost' in 1589, 'Two Gentlemen\r\nof Verona' in 1589 or 1590,\" and so forth, and then asks, \"with this\r\ncatalogue of dramatic work on hand... was it possible that he could have\r\ntaken a leading part in the management and conduct of two theaters,\r\nand if Mr. Phillipps is to be relied upon, taken his share in the\r\nperformances of the provincial tours of his company--and at the same\r\ntime devoted himself to the study of the law in all its branches so\r\nefficiently as to make himself complete master of its principles and\r\npractice, and saturate his mind with all its most technical terms?\"\r\n\r\nI have cited this passage from Lord Penzance's book, because it\r\nlay before me, and I had already quoted from it on the matter of\r\nShakespeare's legal knowledge; but other writers have still better set\r\nforth the insuperable difficulties, as they seem to me, which beset the\r\nidea that Shakespeare might have found time in some unknown period\r\nof early life, amid multifarious other occupations, for the study of\r\nclassics, literature, and law, to say nothing of languages and a few\r\nother matters. Lord Penzance further asks his readers: \"Did you ever\r\nmeet with or hear of an instance in which a young man in this country\r\ngave himself up to legal studies and engaged in legal employments,\r\nwhich is the only way of becoming familiar with the technicalities of\r\npractice, unless with the view of practicing in that profession? I do\r\nnot believe that it would be easy, or indeed possible, to produce\r\nan instance in which the law has been seriously studied in all\r\nits branches, except as a qualification for practice in the legal\r\nprofession.\"\r\n\r\nThis testimony is so strong, so direct, so authoritative; and so\r\nuncheapened, unwatered by guesses, and surmises, and maybe-so's, and\r\nmight-have-beens, and could-have-beens, and must-have-beens, and the\r\nrest of that ton of plaster of Paris out of which the biographers have\r\nbuilt the colossal brontosaur which goes by the Stratford actor's name,\r\nthat it quite convinces me that the man who wrote Shakespeare's Works\r\nknew all about law and lawyers. Also, that that man could not have been\r\nthe Stratford Shakespeare--and WASN'T.\r\n\r\nWho did write these Works, then?\r\n\r\nI wish I knew.\r\n\r\n     1.  From Chapter XIII of THE SHAKESPEARE PROBLEM RESTATED. By\r\nGeorge G. Greenwood, M.P. John Lane Company, publishers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nDid Francis Bacon write Shakespeare's Works? Nobody knows.\r\n\r\nWe cannot say we KNOW a thing when that thing has not been proved.\r\nKNOW is too strong a word to use when the evidence is not final\r\nand absolutely conclusive. We can infer, if we want to, like those\r\nslaves.... No, I will not write that word, it is not kind, it is not\r\ncourteous. The upholders of the Stratford-Shakespeare superstition call\r\nUS the hardest names they can think of, and they keep doing it all the\r\ntime; very well, if they like to descend to that level, let them do it,\r\nbut I will not so undignify myself as to follow them. I cannot call them\r\nharsh names; the most I can do is to indicate them by terms reflecting\r\nmy disapproval; and this without malice, without venom.\r\n\r\nTo resume. What I was about to say was, those thugs have built their\r\nentire superstition upon INFERENCES, not upon known and established\r\nfacts. It is a weak method, and poor, and I am glad to be able to say\r\nour side never resorts to it while there is anything else to resort to.\r\n\r\nBut when we must, we must; and we have now arrived at a place of that\r\nsort.... Since the Stratford Shakespeare couldn't have written the\r\nWorks, we infer that somebody did. Who was it, then? This requires some\r\nmore inferring.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily when an unsigned poem sweeps across the continent like a\r\ntidal wave whose roar and boom and thunder are made up of admiration,\r\ndelight, and applause, a dozen obscure people rise up and claim the\r\nauthorship. Why a dozen, instead of only one or two? One reason is,\r\nbecause there are a dozen that are recognizably competent to do that\r\npoem. Do you remember \"Beautiful Snow\"? Do you remember \"Rock Me to\r\nSleep, Mother, Rock Me to Sleep\"? Do you remember \"Backward, turn,\r\nbackward, O Time, in thy flight! Make me a child again just for\r\ntonight\"? I remember them very well. Their authorship was claimed\r\nby most of the grown-up people who were alive at the time, and every\r\nclaimant had one plausible argument in his favor, at least--to wit, he\r\ncould have done the authoring; he was competent.\r\n\r\nHave the Works been claimed by a dozen? They haven't. There was good\r\nreason. The world knows there was but one man on the planet at the\r\ntime who was competent--not a dozen, and not two. A long time ago the\r\ndwellers in a far country used now and then to find a procession of\r\nprodigious footprints stretching across the plain--footprints that were\r\nthree miles apart, each footprint a third of a mile long and a furlong\r\ndeep, and with forests and villages mashed to mush in it. Was there any\r\ndoubt as to who made that mighty trail? Were there a dozen claimants?\r\nWhere there two? No--the people knew who it was that had been along\r\nthere: there was only one Hercules.\r\n\r\nThere has been only one Shakespeare. There couldn't be two; certainly\r\nthere couldn't be two at the same time. It takes ages to bring forth a\r\nShakespeare, and some more ages to match him. This one was not matched\r\nbefore his time; nor during his time; and hasn't been matched since. The\r\nprospect of matching him in our time is not bright.\r\n\r\nThe Baconians claim that the Stratford Shakespeare was not qualified\r\nto write the Works, and that Francis Bacon was. They claim that Bacon\r\npossessed the stupendous equipment--both natural and acquired--for the\r\nmiracle; and that no other Englishman of his day possessed the like; or,\r\nindeed, anything closely approaching it.\r\n\r\nMacaulay, in his Essay, has much to say about the splendor and\r\nhorizonless magnitude of that equipment. Also, he has synopsized Bacon's\r\nhistory--a thing which cannot be done for the Stratford Shakespeare,\r\nfor he hasn't any history to synopsize. Bacon's history is open to the\r\nworld, from his boyhood to his death in old age--a history consisting\r\nof known facts, displayed in minute and multitudinous detail; FACTS, not\r\nguesses and conjectures and might-have-beens.\r\n\r\nWhereby it appears that he was born of a race of statesmen, and had a\r\nLord Chancellor for his father, and a mother who was \"distinguished both\r\nas a linguist and a theologian: she corresponded in Greek with Bishop\r\nJewell, and translated his APOLOGIA from the Latin so correctly that\r\nneither he nor Archbishop Parker could suggest a single alteration.\" It\r\nis the atmosphere we are reared in that determines how our inclinations\r\nand aspirations shall tend. The atmosphere furnished by the parents to\r\nthe son in this present case was an atmosphere saturated with learning;\r\nwith thinkings and ponderings upon deep subjects; and with polite\r\nculture. It had its natural effect. Shakespeare of Stratford was reared\r\nin a house which had no use for books, since its owners, his parents,\r\nwere without education. This may have had an effect upon the son, but\r\nwe do not know, because we have no history of him of an informing sort.\r\nThere were but few books anywhere, in that day, and only the well-to-do\r\nand highly educated possessed them, they being almost confined to\r\nthe dead languages. \"All the valuable books then extant in all the\r\nvernacular dialects of Europe would hardly have filled a single\r\nshelf\"--imagine it! The few existing books were in the Latin tongue\r\nmainly. \"A person who was ignorant of it was shut out from all\r\nacquaintance--not merely with Cicero and Virgil, but with the most\r\ninteresting memoirs, state papers, and pamphlets of his own time\"--a\r\nliterature necessary to the Stratford lad, for his fictitious\r\nreputation's sake, since the writer of his Works would begin to use it\r\nwholesale and in a most masterly way before the lad was hardly more than\r\nout of his teens and into his twenties.\r\n\r\nAt fifteen Bacon was sent to the university, and he spent three years\r\nthere. Thence he went to Paris in the train of the English Ambassador,\r\nand there he mingled daily with the wise, the cultured, the great, and\r\nthe aristocracy of fashion, during another three years. A total of six\r\nyears spent at the sources of knowledge; knowledge both of books and of\r\nmen. The three spent at the university were coeval with the second\r\nand last three spent by the little Stratford lad at Stratford school\r\nsupposedly, and perhapsedly, and maybe, and by inference--with nothing\r\nto infer from. The second three of the Baconian six were \"presumably\"\r\nspent by the Stratford lad as apprentice to a butcher. That is, the\r\nthugs presume it--on no evidence of any kind. Which is their way, when\r\nthey want a historical fact. Fact and presumption are, for business\r\npurposes, all the same to them. They know the difference, but they also\r\nknow how to blink it. They know, too, that while in history-building a\r\nfact is better than a presumption, it doesn't take a presumption long\r\nto bloom into a fact when THEY have the handling of it. They know by old\r\nexperience that when they get hold of a presumption-tadpole he is\r\nnot going to STAY tadpole in their history-tank; no, they know how to\r\ndevelop him into the giant four-legged bullfrog of FACT, and make\r\nhim sit up on his hams, and puff out his chin, and look important\r\nand insolent and come-to-stay; and assert his genuine simon-pure\r\nauthenticity with a thundering bellow that will convince everybody\r\nbecause it is so loud. The thug is aware that loudness convinces sixty\r\npersons where reasoning convinces but one. I wouldn't be a thug, not\r\neven if--but never mind about that, it has nothing to do with the\r\nargument, and it is not noble in spirit besides. If I am better than a\r\nthug, is the merit mine? No, it is His. Then to Him be the praise. That\r\nis the right spirit.\r\n\r\nThey \"presume\" the lad severed his \"presumed\" connection with the\r\nStratford school to become apprentice to a butcher. They also \"presume\"\r\nthat the butcher was his father. They don't know. There is no written\r\nrecord of it, nor any other actual evidence. If it would have helped\r\ntheir case any, they would have apprenticed him to thirty butchers,\r\nto fifty butchers, to a wilderness of butchers--all by their patented\r\nmethod \"presumption.\" If it will help their case they will do it yet;\r\nand if it will further help it, they will \"presume\" that all those\r\nbutchers were his father. And the week after, they will SAY it. Why, it\r\nis just like being the past tense of the compound reflexive adverbial\r\nincandescent hypodermic irregular accusative Noun of Multitude; which is\r\nfather to the expression which the grammarians call Verb. It is like a\r\nwhole ancestry, with only one posterity.\r\n\r\nTo resume. Next, the young Bacon took up the study of law, and mastered\r\nthat abstruse science. From that day to the end of his life he was daily\r\nin close contact with lawyers and judges; not as a casual onlooker\r\nin intervals between holding horses in front of a theater, but as\r\na practicing lawyer--a great and successful one, a renowned one, a\r\nLauncelot of the bar, the most formidable lance in the high brotherhood\r\nof the legal Table Round; he lived in the law's atmosphere thenceforth,\r\nall his years, and by sheer ability forced his way up its difficult\r\nsteeps to its supremest summit, the Lord-Chancellorship, leaving behind\r\nhim no fellow-craftsman qualified to challenge his divine right to that\r\nmajestic place.\r\n\r\nWhen we read the praises bestowed by Lord Penzance and the other\r\nillustrious experts upon the legal condition and legal aptnesses,\r\nbrilliances, profundities, and felicities so prodigally displayed in the\r\nPlays, and try to fit them to the historyless Stratford stage-manager,\r\nthey sound wild, strange, incredible, ludicrous; but when we put them in\r\nthe mouth of Bacon they do not sound strange, they seem in their natural\r\nand rightful place, they seem at home there. Please turn back and read\r\nthem again. Attributed to Shakespeare of Stratford they are meaningless,\r\nthey are inebriate extravagancies--intemperate admirations of the dark\r\nside of the moon, so to speak; attributed to Bacon, they are admirations\r\nof the golden glories of the moon's front side, the moon at the\r\nfull--and not intemperate, not overwrought, but sane and right, and\r\njustified. \"At every turn and point at which the author required a\r\nmetaphor, simile, or illustration, his mind ever turned FIRST to the\r\nlaw; he seems almost to have THOUGHT in legal phrases; the commonest\r\nlegal phrases, the commonest of legal expressions, were ever at the end\r\nof his pen.\" That could happen to no one but a person whose TRADE was\r\nthe law; it could not happen to a dabbler in it. Veteran mariners fill\r\ntheir conversation with sailor-phrases and draw all their similes from\r\nthe ship and the sea and the storm, but no mere PASSENGER ever does it,\r\nbe he of Stratford or elsewhere; or could do it with anything resembling\r\naccuracy, if he were hardy enough to try. Please read again what Lord\r\nCampbell and the other great authorities have said about Bacon when they\r\nthought they were saying it about Shakespeare of Stratford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nThe Rest of the Equipment\r\n\r\nThe author of the Plays was equipped, beyond every other man of his\r\ntime, with wisdom, erudition, imagination, capaciousness of mind, grace,\r\nand majesty of expression. Every one has said it, no one doubts it.\r\nAlso, he had humor, humor in rich abundance, and always wanting to\r\nbreak out. We have no evidence of any kind that Shakespeare of Stratford\r\npossessed any of these gifts or any of these acquirements. The only\r\nlines he ever wrote, so far as we know, are substantially barren of\r\nthem--barren of all of them.\r\n\r\nGood friend for Iesus sake forbeare To digg the dust encloased heare:\r\nBlest be ye man yt spares thes stones And curst be he yt moves my bones.\r\n\r\nBen Jonson says of Bacon, as orator:\r\n\r\nHis language, WHERE HE COULD SPARE AND PASS BY A JEST, was nobly\r\ncensorious. No man ever spoke more neatly, more pressly, more weightily,\r\nor suffered less emptiness, less idleness, in what he uttered. No member\r\nof his speech but consisted of his (its) own graces.... The fear of\r\nevery man that heard him was lest he should make an end.\r\n\r\nFrom Macaulay:\r\n\r\nHe continued to distinguish himself in Parliament, particularly by his\r\nexertions in favor of one excellent measure on which the King's heart\r\nwas set--the union of England and Scotland. It was not difficult for\r\nsuch an intellect to discover many irresistible arguments in favor\r\nof such a scheme. He conducted the great case of the POST NATI in\r\nthe Exchequer Chamber; and the decision of the judges--a decision the\r\nlegality of which may be questioned, but the beneficial effect of which\r\nmust be acknowledged--was in a great measure attributed to his dexterous\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\nWhile actively engaged in the House of Commons and in the courts of law,\r\nhe still found leisure for letters and philosophy. The noble treatise on\r\nthe ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING, which at a later period was expanded into\r\nthe DE AUGMENTIS, appeared in 1605.\r\n\r\nThe WISDOM OF THE ANCIENTS, a work which, if it had proceeded from any\r\nother writer, would have been considered as a masterpiece of wit and\r\nlearning, was printed in 1609.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the NOVUM ORGANUM was slowly proceeding. Several\r\ndistinguished men of learning had been permitted to see portions of that\r\nextraordinary book, and they spoke with the greatest admiration of his\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nEven Sir Thomas Bodley, after perusing the COGITATA ET VISA, one of the\r\nmost precious of those scattered leaves out of which the great oracular\r\nvolume was afterward made up, acknowledged that \"in all proposals and\r\nplots in that book, Bacon showed himself a master workman\"; and that \"it\r\ncould not be gainsaid but all the treatise over did abound with\r\nchoice conceits of the present state of learning, and with worthy\r\ncontemplations of the means to procure it.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1612 a new edition of the ESSAYS appeared, with additions surpassing\r\nthe original collection both in bulk and quality.\r\n\r\nNor did these pursuits distract Bacon's attention from a work the most\r\narduous, the most glorious, and the most useful that even his mighty\r\npowers could have achieved, \"the reducing and recompiling,\" to use his\r\nown phrase, \"of the laws of England.\"\r\n\r\nTo serve the exacting and laborious offices of Attorney-General and\r\nSolicitor-General would have satisfied the appetite of any other man\r\nfor hard work, but Bacon had to add the vast literary industries just\r\ndescribed, to satisfy his. He was a born worker.\r\n\r\nThe service which he rendered to letters during the last five years of\r\nhis life, amid ten thousand distractions and vexations, increase the\r\nregret with which we think on the many years which he had wasted, to use\r\nthe words of Sir Thomas Bodley, \"on such study as was not worthy such a\r\nstudent.\"\r\n\r\nHe commenced a digest of the laws of England, a History of England\r\nunder the Princes of the House of Tudor, a body of National History, a\r\nPhilosophical Romance. He made extensive and valuable additions to his\r\nEssays. He published the inestimable TREATISE DE AUGMENTIS SCIENTIARUM.\r\n\r\nDid these labors of Hercules fill up his time to his contentment, and\r\nquiet his appetite for work? Not entirely:\r\n\r\nThe trifles with which he amused himself in hours of pain and languor\r\nbore the mark of his mind. THE BEST JEST-BOOK IN THE WORLD is that which\r\nhe dictated from memory, without referring to any book, on a day on\r\nwhich illness had rendered him incapable of serious study.\r\n\r\nHere are some scattered remarks (from Macaulay) which throw light\r\nupon Bacon, and seem to indicate--and maybe demonstrate--that he was\r\ncompetent to write the Plays and Poems:\r\n\r\nWith great minuteness of observation he had an amplitude of\r\ncomprehension such as has never yet been vouchsafed to any other human\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nThe ESSAYS contain abundant proofs that no nice feature of character,\r\nno peculiarity in the ordering of a house, a garden, or a court-masque,\r\ncould escape the notice of one whose mind was capable of taking in the\r\nwhole world of knowledge.\r\n\r\nHis understanding resembled the tent which the fairy Paribanou gave\r\nto Prince Ahmed: fold it, and it seemed a toy for the hand of a lady;\r\nspread it, and the armies of the powerful Sultans might repose beneath\r\nits shade.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge in which Bacon excelled all men was a knowledge of the\r\nmutual relations of all departments of knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn a letter written when he was only thirty-one, to his uncle, Lord\r\nBurleigh, he said, \"I have taken all knowledge to be my province.\"\r\n\r\nThough Bacon did not arm his philosophy with the weapons of logic, he\r\nadorned her profusely with all the richest decorations of rhetoric.\r\n\r\nThe practical faculty was powerful in Bacon; but not, like his wit,\r\nso powerful as occasionally to usurp the place of his reason and to\r\ntyrannize over the whole man.\r\n\r\nThere are too many places in the Plays where this happens. Poor old\r\ndying John of Gaunt volleying second-rate puns at his own name, is a\r\npathetic instance of it. \"We may assume\" that it is Bacon's fault, but\r\nthe Stratford Shakespeare has to bear the blame.\r\n\r\nNo imagination was ever at once so strong and so thoroughly subjugated.\r\nIt stopped at the first check from good sense.\r\n\r\nIn truth, much of Bacon's life was passed in a visionary world--amid\r\nthings as strange as any that are described in the ARABIAN TALES...\r\namid buildings more sumptuous than the palace of Aladdin, fountains more\r\nwonderful than the golden water of Parizade, conveyances more rapid\r\nthan the hippogryph of Ruggiero, arms more formidable than the lance of\r\nAstolfo, remedies more efficacious than the balsam of Fierabras. Yet\r\nin his magnificent day-dreams there was nothing wild--nothing but what\r\nsober reason sanctioned.\r\n\r\nBacon's greatest performance is the first book of the NOVUM ORGANUM... .\r\nEvery part of it blazes with wit, but with wit which is employed only to\r\nillustrate and decorate truth. No book ever made so great a revolution\r\nin the mode of thinking, overthrew so may prejudices, introduced so many\r\nnew opinions.\r\n\r\nBut what we most admire is the vast capacity of that intellect which,\r\nwithout effort, takes in at once all the domains of science--all the\r\npast, the present and the future, all the errors of two thousand years,\r\nall the encouraging signs of the passing times, all the bright hopes of\r\nthe coming age.\r\n\r\nHe had a wonderful talent for packing thought close and rendering it\r\nportable.\r\n\r\nHis eloquence would alone have entitled him to a high rank in\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that he had each and every one of the mental gifts and\r\neach and every one of the acquirements that are so prodigally displayed\r\nin the Plays and Poems, and in much higher and richer degree than any\r\nother man of his time or of any previous time. He was a genius without a\r\nmate, a prodigy not matable. There was only one of him; the planet\r\ncould not produce two of him at one birth, nor in one age. He could have\r\nwritten anything that is in the Plays and Poems. He could have written\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     The cloud-cap'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,\r\n     The solemn temples, the great globe itself,\r\n     Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,\r\n     And, like an insubstantial pageant faded,\r\n     Leave not a rack behind.  We are such stuff\r\n     As dreams are made on, and our little life\r\n     Is rounded with a sleep.\r\n\r\nAlso, he could have written this, but he refrained:\r\n\r\n     Good friend for Iesus sake forbeare\r\n     To digg the dust encloased heare:\r\n     Blest be ye man yt spares thes stones\r\n     And curst be he yt moves my bones.\r\n\r\nWhen a person reads the noble verses about the cloud-cap'd towers,\r\nhe ought not to follow it immediately with Good friend for Iesus sake\r\nforbeare, because he will find the transition from great poetry to\r\npoor prose too violent for comfort. It will give him a shock. You never\r\nnotice how commonplace and unpoetic gravel is until you bite into a\r\nlayer of it in a pie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nAm I trying to convince anybody that Shakespeare did not write\r\nShakespeare's Works? Ah, now, what do you take me for? Would I be so\r\nsoft as that, after having known the human race familiarly for nearly\r\nseventy-four years? It would grieve me to know that any one could think\r\nso injuriously of me, so uncomplimentarily, so unadmiringly of me. No,\r\nno, I am aware that when even the brightest mind in our world has been\r\ntrained up from childhood in a superstition of any kind, it will never\r\nbe possible for that mind, in its maturity, to examine sincerely,\r\ndispassionately, and conscientiously any evidence or any circumstance\r\nwhich shall seem to cast a doubt upon the validity of that superstition.\r\nI doubt if I could do it myself. We always get at second hand our\r\nnotions about systems of government; and high tariff and low tariff;\r\nand prohibition and anti-prohibition; and the holiness of peace and the\r\nglories of war; and codes of honor and codes of morals; and approval of\r\nthe duel and disapproval of it; and our beliefs concerning the nature of\r\ncats; and our ideas as to whether the murder of helpless wild animals\r\nis base or is heroic; and our preferences in the matter of religious and\r\npolitical parties; and our acceptance or rejection of the Shakespeares\r\nand the Author Ortons and the Mrs. Eddys. We get them all at second\r\nhand, we reason none of them out for ourselves. It is the way we are\r\nmade. It is the way we are all made, and we can't help it, we can't\r\nchange it. And whenever we have been furnished a fetish, and have been\r\ntaught to believe in it, and love it and worship it, and refrain from\r\nexamining it, there is no evidence, howsoever clear and strong, that can\r\npersuade us to withdraw from it our loyalty and our devotion. In\r\nmorals, conduct, and beliefs we take the color of our environment and\r\nassociations, and it is a color that can safely be warranted to wash.\r\nWhenever we have been furnished with a tar baby ostensibly stuffed\r\nwith jewels, and warned that it will be dishonorable and irreverent to\r\ndisembowel it and test the jewels, we keep our sacrilegious hands off\r\nit. We submit, not reluctantly, but rather gladly, for we are privately\r\nafraid we should find, upon examination that the jewels are of the sort\r\nthat are manufactured at North Adams, Mass.\r\n\r\nI haven't any idea that Shakespeare will have to vacate his pedestal\r\nthis side of the year 2209. Disbelief in him cannot come swiftly,\r\ndisbelief in a healthy and deeply-loved tar baby has never been known\r\nto disintegrate swiftly; it is a very slow process. It took several\r\nthousand years to convince our fine race--including every splendid\r\nintellect in it--that there is no such thing as a witch; it has taken\r\nseveral thousand years to convince the same fine race--including every\r\nsplendid intellect in it--that there is no such person as Satan; it has\r\ntaken several centuries to remove perdition from the Protestant Church's\r\nprogram of post-mortem entertainments; it has taken a weary long time to\r\npersuade American Presbyterians to give up infant damnation and try to\r\nbear it the best they can; and it looks as if their Scotch brethren will\r\nstill be burning babies in the everlasting fires when Shakespeare comes\r\ndown from his perch.\r\n\r\nWe are The Reasoning Race. We can't prove it by the above examples,\r\nand we can't prove it by the miraculous \"histories\" built by those\r\nStratfordolaters out of a hatful of rags and a barrel of sawdust, but\r\nthere is a plenty of other things we can prove it by, if I could think\r\nof them. We are The Reasoning Race, and when we find a vague file of\r\nchipmunk-tracks stringing through the dust of Stratford village, we know\r\nby our reasoning bowers that Hercules has been along there. I feel that\r\nour fetish is safe for three centuries yet. The bust, too--there in the\r\nStratford Church. The precious bust, the priceless bust, the calm bust,\r\nthe serene bust, the emotionless bust, with the dandy mustache, and the\r\nputty face, unseamed of care--that face which has looked passionlessly\r\ndown upon the awed pilgrim for a hundred and fifty years and will still\r\nlook down upon the awed pilgrim three hundred more, with the deep, deep,\r\ndeep, subtle, subtle, subtle expression of a bladder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nIrreverence\r\n\r\nOne of the most trying defects which I find in these--these--what shall\r\nI call them? for I will not apply injurious epithets to them, the way\r\nthey do to us, such violations of courtesy being repugnant to my nature\r\nand my dignity. The farthest I can go in that direction is to call them\r\nby names of limited reverence--names merely descriptive, never unkind,\r\nnever offensive, never tainted by harsh feeling. If THEY would do\r\nlike this, they would feel better in their hearts. Very well,\r\nthen--to proceed. One of the most trying defects which I find in these\r\nStratfordolaters, these Shakesperiods, these thugs, these bangalores,\r\nthese troglodytes, these herumfrodites, these blatherskites, these\r\nbuccaneers, these bandoleers, is their spirit of irreverence. It is\r\ndetectable in every utterance of theirs when they are talking about us.\r\nI am thankful that in me there is nothing of that spirit. When a thing\r\nis sacred to me it is impossible for me to be irreverent toward it. I\r\ncannot call to mind a single instance where I have ever been irreverent,\r\nexcept towards the things which were sacred to other people. Am I in\r\nthe right? I think so. But I ask no one to take my unsupported word;\r\nno, look at the dictionary; let the dictionary decide. Here is the\r\ndefinition:\r\n\r\nIRREVERENCE. The quality or condition of irreverence toward God and\r\nsacred things.\r\n\r\nWhat does the Hindu say? He says it is correct. He says irreverence\r\nis lack of respect for Vishnu, and Brahma, and Chrishna, and his other\r\ngods, and for his sacred cattle, and for his temples and the things\r\nwithin them. He endorses the definition, you see; and there are\r\n300,000,000 Hindus or their equivalents back of him.\r\n\r\nThe dictionary had the acute idea that by using the capital G it could\r\nrestrict irreverence to lack of reverence for OUR Deity and our sacred\r\nthings, but that ingenious and rather sly idea miscarried: for by\r\nthe simple process of spelling HIS deities with capitals the Hindu\r\nconfiscates the definition and restricts it to his own sects, thus\r\nmaking it clearly compulsory upon us to revere HIS gods and HIS sacred\r\nthings, and nobody's else. We can't say a word, for he has our own\r\ndictionary at his back, and its decision is final.\r\n\r\nThis law, reduced to its simplest terms, is this: 1. Whatever is\r\nsacred to the Christian must be held in reverence by everybody else; 2.\r\nwhatever is sacred to the Hindu must be held in reverence by everybody\r\nelse; 3. therefore, by consequence, logically, and indisputably,\r\nwhatever is sacred to ME must be held in reverence by everybody else.\r\n\r\nNow then, what aggravates me is that these troglodytes and muscovites\r\nand bandoleers and buccaneers are ALSO trying to crowd in and share the\r\nbenefit of the law, and compel everybody to revere their Shakespeare and\r\nhold him sacred. We can't have that: there's enough of us already. If\r\nyou go on widening and spreading and inflating the privilege, it will\r\npresently come to be conceded that each man's sacred things are the ONLY\r\nones, and the rest of the human race will have to be humbly reverent\r\ntoward them or suffer for it. That can surely happen, and when it\r\nhappens, the word Irreverence will be regarded as the most meaningless,\r\nand foolish, and self-conceited, and insolent, and impudent, and\r\ndictatorial word in the language. And people will say, \"Whose business\r\nis it what gods I worship and what things hold sacred? Who has the right\r\nto dictate to my conscience, and where did he get that right?\"\r\n\r\nWe cannot afford to let that calamity come upon us. We must save the\r\nword from this destruction. There is but one way to do it, and that\r\nis to stop the spread of the privilege and strictly confine it to its\r\npresent limits--that is, to all the Christian sects, to all the Hindu\r\nsects, and me. We do not need any more, the stock is watered enough,\r\njust as it is.\r\n\r\nIt would be better if the privilege were limited to me alone. I think so\r\nbecause I am the only sect that knows how to employ it gently, kindly,\r\ncharitably, dispassionately. The other sects lack the quality of\r\nself-restraint. The Catholic Church says the most irreverent things\r\nabout matters which are sacred to the Protestants, and the Protestant\r\nChurch retorts in kind about the confessional and other matters which\r\nCatholics hold sacred; then both of these irreverencers turn upon Thomas\r\nPaine and charge HIM with irreverence. This is all unfortunate, because\r\nit makes it difficult for students equipped with only a low grade of\r\nmentality to find out what Irreverence really IS.\r\n\r\nIt will surely be much better all around if the privilege of regulating\r\nthe irreverent and keeping them in order shall eventually be withdrawn\r\nfrom all the sects but me. Then there will be no more quarreling, no\r\nmore bandying of disrespectful epithets, no more heartburnings.\r\n\r\nThere will then be nothing sacred involved in this Bacon-Shakespeare\r\ncontroversy except what is sacred to me. That will simplify the whole\r\nmatter, and trouble will cease. There will be irreverence no longer,\r\nbecause I will not allow it. The first time those criminals charge\r\nme with irreverence for calling their Stratford myth an\r\nArthur-Orton-Mary-Baker-Thompson-Eddy-Louis-the-Seventeenth-Veiled-Prophet\r\n-of-Khorassan will be the last. Taught by the methods found effective in\r\nextinguishing earlier offenders by the Inquisition, of holy memory, I\r\nshall know how to quiet them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nIsn't it odd, when you think of it, that you may list all the celebrated\r\nEnglishmen, Irishmen, and Scotchmen of modern times, clear back to the\r\nfirst Tudors--a list containing five hundred names, shall we say?--and\r\nyou can go to the histories, biographies, and cyclopedias and learn the\r\nparticulars of the lives of every one of them. Every one of them except\r\none--the most famous, the most renowned--by far the most illustrious of\r\nthem all--Shakespeare! You can get the details of the lives of all the\r\ncelebrated ecclesiastics in the list; all the celebrated tragedians,\r\ncomedians, singers, dancers, orators, judges, lawyers, poets,\r\ndramatists, historians, biographers, editors, inventors, reformers,\r\nstatesmen, generals, admirals, discoverers, prize-fighters, murderers,\r\npirates, conspirators, horse-jockeys, bunco-steerers, misers,\r\nswindlers, explorers, adventurers by land and sea, bankers, financiers,\r\nastronomers, naturalists, claimants, impostors, chemists, biologists,\r\ngeologists, philologists, college presidents and professors, architects,\r\nengineers, painters, sculptors, politicians, agitators, rebels,\r\nrevolutionists, patriots, demagogues, clowns, cooks, freaks,\r\nphilosophers, burglars, highwaymen, journalists, physicians,\r\nsurgeons--you can get the life-histories of all of them but ONE.\r\nJust ONE--the most extraordinary and the most celebrated of them\r\nall--Shakespeare!\r\n\r\nYou may add to the list the thousand celebrated persons furnished by the\r\nrest of Christendom in the past four centuries, and you can find out\r\nthe life-histories of all those people, too. You will then have\r\nlisted fifteen hundred celebrities, and you can trace the authentic\r\nlife-histories of the whole of them. Save one--far and away the most\r\ncolossal prodigy of the entire accumulation--Shakespeare! About him you\r\ncan find out NOTHING. Nothing of even the slightest importance. Nothing\r\nworth the trouble of stowing away in your memory. Nothing that even\r\nremotely indicates that he was ever anything more than a distinctly\r\ncommonplace person--a manager, an actor of inferior grade, a small\r\ntrader in a small village that did not regard him as a person of any\r\nconsequence, and had forgotten all about him before he was fairly cold\r\nin his grave. We can go to the records and find out the life-history of\r\nevery renowned RACE-HORSE of modern times--but not Shakespeare's! There\r\nare many reasons why, and they have been furnished in cart-loads (of\r\nguess and conjecture) by those troglodytes; but there is one that\r\nis worth all the rest of the reasons put together, and is abundantly\r\nsufficient all by itself--HE HADN'T ANY HISTORY TO RECORD. There is no\r\nway of getting around that deadly fact. And no sane way has yet been\r\ndiscovered of getting around its formidable significance.\r\n\r\nIts quite plain significance--to any but those thugs (I do not use the\r\nterm unkindly) is, that Shakespeare had no prominence while he lived,\r\nand none until he had been dead two or three generations. The Plays\r\nenjoyed high fame from the beginning; and if he wrote them it seems a\r\npity the world did not find it out. He ought to have explained that he\r\nwas the author, and not merely a NOM DE PLUME for another man to hide\r\nbehind. If he had been less intemperately solicitous about his bones,\r\nand more solicitous about his Works, it would have been better for his\r\ngood name, and a kindness to us. The bones were not important. They will\r\nmoulder away, they will turn to dust, but the Works will endure until\r\nthe last sun goes down.\r\n\r\n\r\nMark Twain.\r\n\r\nP.S. MARCH 25. About two months ago I was illuminating this\r\nAutobiography with some notions of mine concerning the Bacon-Shakespeare\r\ncontroversy, and I then took occasion to air the opinion that the\r\nStratford Shakespeare was a person of no public consequence or celebrity\r\nduring his lifetime, but was utterly obscure and unimportant. And not\r\nonly in great London, but also in the little village where he was born,\r\nwhere he lived a quarter of a century, and where he died and was buried.\r\nI argued that if he had been a person of any note at all, aged villagers\r\nwould have had much to tell about him many and many a year after his\r\ndeath, instead of being unable to furnish inquirers a single fact\r\nconnected with him. I believed, and I still believe, that if he had been\r\nfamous, his notoriety would have lasted as long as mine has lasted in\r\nmy native village out in Missouri. It is a good argument, a prodigiously\r\nstrong one, and most formidable one for even the most gifted and\r\ningenious and plausible Stratfordolator to get around or explain away.\r\nToday a Hannibal COURIER-POST of recent date has reached me, with an\r\narticle in it which reinforces my contention that a really celebrated\r\nperson cannot be forgotten in his village in the short space of sixty\r\nyears. I will make an extract from it:\r\n\r\nHannibal, as a city, may have many sins to answer for, but ingratitude\r\nis not one of them, or reverence for the great men she has produced, and\r\nas the years go by her greatest son, Mark Twain, or S. L. Clemens as a\r\nfew of the unlettered call him, grows in the estimation and regard of\r\nthe residents of the town he made famous and the town that made him\r\nfamous. His name is associated with every old building that is torn\r\ndown to make way for the modern structures demanded by a rapidly growing\r\ncity, and with every hill or cave over or through which he might by any\r\npossibility have roamed, while the many points of interest which he wove\r\ninto his stories, such as Holiday Hill, Jackson's Island, or Mark\r\nTwain Cave, are now monuments to his genius. Hannibal is glad of any\r\nopportunity to do him honor as he had honored her.\r\n\r\nSo it has happened that the \"old timers\" who went to school with Mark\r\nor were with him on some of his usual escapades have been honored\r\nwith large audiences whenever they were in a reminiscent mood and\r\ncondescended to tell of their intimacy with the ordinary boy who came to\r\nbe a very extraordinary humorist and whose every boyish act is now seen\r\nto have been indicative of what was to come. Like Aunt Becky and Mrs.\r\nClemens, they can now see that Mark was hardly appreciated when he lived\r\nhere and that the things he did as a boy and was whipped for doing were\r\nnot all bad, after all. So they have been in no hesitancy about drawing\r\nout the bad things he did as well as the good in their efforts to get\r\na \"Mark Twain\" story, all incidents being viewed in the light of his\r\npresent fame, until the volume of \"Twainiana\" is already considerable\r\nand growing in proportion as the \"old timers\" drop away and the stories\r\nare retold second and third hand by their descendants. With some\r\nseventy-three years young and living in a villa instead of a house, he is a\r\nfair target, and let him incorporate, copyright, or patent himself as\r\nhe will, there are some of his \"works\" that will go swooping up Hannibal\r\nchimneys as long as graybeards gather about the fires and begin with,\r\n\"I've heard father tell,\" or possibly, \"Once when I.\" The Mrs. Clemens\r\nreferred to is my mother--WAS my mother.\r\n\r\nAnd here is another extract from a Hannibal paper, of date twenty days\r\nago:\r\n\r\nMiss Becca Blankenship died at the home of William Dickason, 408 Rock\r\nStreet, at 2.30 o'clock yesterday afternoon, aged 72 years. The deceased\r\nwas a sister of \"Huckleberry Finn,\" one of the famous characters in Mark\r\nTwain's TOM SAWYER. She had been a member of the Dickason family--the\r\nhousekeeper--for nearly forty-five years, and was a highly respected\r\nlady. For the past eight years she had been an invalid, but was as\r\nwell cared for by Mr. Dickason and his family as if she had been a near\r\nrelative. She was a member of the Park Methodist Church and a Christian\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nI remember her well. I have a picture of her in my mind which was graven\r\nthere, clear and sharp and vivid, sixty-three years ago. She was at that\r\ntime nine years old, and I was about eleven. I remember where she stood,\r\nand how she looked; and I can still see her bare feet, her bare head,\r\nher brown face, and her short tow-linen frock. She was crying. What it\r\nwas about I have long ago forgotten. But it was the tears that preserved\r\nthe picture for me, no doubt. She was a good child, I can say that for\r\nher. She knew me nearly seventy years ago. Did she forget me, in\r\nthe course of time? I think not. If she had lived in Stratford in\r\nShakespeare's time, would she have forgotten him? Yes. For he was never\r\nfamous during his lifetime, he was utterly obscure in Stratford, and\r\nthere wouldn't be any occasion to remember him after he had been dead a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\n\"Injun Joe,\" \"Jimmy Finn,\" and \"General Gaines\" were prominent and very\r\nintemperate ne'er-do-weels in Hannibal two generations ago. Plenty of\r\ngrayheads there remember them to this day, and can tell you about them.\r\nIsn't it curious that two \"town drunkards\" and one half-breed loafer\r\nshould leave behind them, in a remote Missourian village, a fame a\r\nhundred times greater and several hundred times more particularized in\r\nthe matter of definite facts than Shakespeare left behind him in the\r\nvillage where he had lived the half of his lifetime?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of What Is Man?
