Changes that have been\r\nreported but not yet acted upon by BGN are noted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Area: Total area is the sum of all land and water areas delimited\r\nby international boundaries and/or coastlines. Land area is the\r\naggregate of all surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or\r\ncoastlines, excluding inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers).\r\nComparative areas are based on total area equivalents. Most entities\r\nare compared with the entire US or one of the 50 states. The smaller\r\nentities are compared with Washington, DC (178 km2, 69 miles2) or\r\nThe Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 km2, 0.23 miles2, 146 acres).\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Birth rate: The average annual number of births during a year\r\nper 1,000 population at midyear. Also known as crude birth rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Dates of information: In general, information available as of 1\r\nJanuary 1991 was used in the preparation of this edition. Population\r\nfigures are estimates for 1 July 1991, with population growth rates\r\nestimated for mid-1991 through mid-1992. Major political events have\r\nbeen updated through 30 June 1991. Military age figures are average\r\nannual estimates for 1991-95.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Death rate: The average annual number of deaths during a year\r\nper l,000 population at midyear. Also known as crude death rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Diplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic\r\nrelations with 162 nations. There are only 144 US embassies, since some\r\nnations have US ambassadors accredited to them, but no physical US\r\nmission exists. The US has diplomatic relations with 151 of the 159 UN\r\nmembers--the exceptions are Angola, Belorussia (Byelorussia;\r\nconstituent republic of the Soviet Union), Cambodia, Cuba, Iran, Vietnam,\r\nUkraine (constituent republic of the Soviet Union) and, obviously, the US\r\nitself. In addition, the US has diplomatic relations with 12 nations that\r\nare not in the UN--Andorra, Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati,\r\nMarshall Islands, Monaco, Nauru, San Marino, South Korea, Switzerland,\r\nTonga, Tuvalu, and the Vatican City. North Korea is not in the UN and the\r\nUS does not have diplomatic relations with that nation. The US has not\r\nrecognized the incorporation of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania into the\r\nSoviet Union and continues to accredit the diplomatic representatives of\r\ntheir last free governments.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Disputes: This category includes a wide variety of situations\r\nthat range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral\r\nclaims of one sort or another. Every international land boundary\r\ndispute in the \"Guide to International Boundaries,\" a map published\r\nby the Department of State, is included. References to other situations\r\nmay also be included that are border- or frontier-relevant, such as\r\nmaritime disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues.\r\nHowever, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance\r\nor recognition by the US Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Economic aid: This entry refers to bilateral commitments of:\r\n\r\nOfficial Development Assistance (ODA), which is defined as government\r\ngrants that (a) are administered with the promotion of economic\r\ndevelopment and welfare of LDCs as their main objective and (b) are\r\nconcessional in character and contain a grant element of at least 25%;\r\nand\r\n\r\nOther Official Flows (OOF) or transactions by the official sector\r\nwhose main objective is other than development-motivated or whose\r\ngrant element is below the 25% threshold for ODA. OOF transactions\r\ninclude official export credits (such as Eximbank credits), official\r\nequity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization by the\r\nofficial sector that does not meet concessional terms.\r\n\r\nAid is considered to have been committed when agreements are\r\ninitialed by the parties involved and constitute a formal declaration\r\nof intent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Entities: Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special\r\nsovereignty, and governments included in this publication are not\r\nindependent, and others are not officially recognized by the US\r\nGovernment. Nation refers to a people politically organized into a\r\nsovereign state with a definite territory. Dependent area refers to a\r\nbroad category of political entities that are associated in some way\r\nwith a nation. Names used for page headings are usually the short-form\r\nnames as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names. The\r\nlong-form name is included in the Government section and an entry\r\nof \"none\" indicates a long-form name does not exist. In some\r\ninstances, no short-form name exists--then the long-form name must\r\nserve for all usages.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are 247 entities in the Factbook that may be categorized as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONS\r\n157 UN members (there are 159 members in the UN, but only 157 are\r\n      included in The World Factbook because Belorussia\r\n      (Byelorussia) and Ukraine are constituent republics of the Soviet\r\n      Union)\r\n 13 nations that are not members of the UN--Andorra, Federated States of\r\n      Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Monaco, Nauru, North Korea,\r\n      San Marino, South Korea, Switzerland, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vatican City\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER\r\n  1 Taiwan\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPENDENT AREAS\r\n  6 Australia--Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Christmas Island,\r\n      Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Coral Sea Islands, Heard Island and\r\n      McDonald Islands, Norfolk Island\r\n  2 Denmark--Faroe Islands, Greenland\r\n 16 France--Bassas da India, Clipperton Island, Europa Island,\r\n      French Guiana, French Polynesia, French Southern and Antarctic\r\n      Lands, Glorioso Islands, Guadeloupe, Juan de Nova Island,\r\n      Martinique, Mayotte, New Caledonia, Reunion, Saint Pierre and\r\n      Miquelon, Tromelin Island, Wallis and Futuna\r\n  2 Netherlands--Aruba, Netherlands Antilles\r\n  3 New Zealand--Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau\r\n  3 Norway--Bouvet Island, Jan Mayen, Svalbard\r\n  1 Portugal--Macau\r\n 16 United Kingdom--Anguilla, Bermuda, British Indian Ocean Territory,\r\n      British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands,\r\n      Gibraltar, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Isle of Man, Jersey, Montserrat,\r\n      Pitcairn Islands, Saint Helena, South Georgia and the South\r\n      Sandwich Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands\r\n 15 United States--American Samoa, Baker Island, Guam, Howland Island,\r\n      Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Islands,\r\n      Navassa Island, Northern Mariana Islands, Palmyra Atoll,\r\n      Puerto Rico, Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (Palau),\r\n      Virgin Islands, Wake Island\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS\r\n  7 Antarctica, Gaza Strip, Iraq-Saudi Arabia Neutral Zone,\r\n      Paracel Islands, Spratly Islands, West Bank, Western Sahara\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER ENTITIES\r\n  4 oceans--Arctic Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean\r\n  1 World\r\n===\r\n247 total\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes: The US Government has not recognized the incorporation of\r\nEstonia, Latvia, and Lithuania into the Soviet Union as constituent\r\nrepublics during World War II. Those Baltic states are not members of the\r\nUN and are not included in the list of nations. The US Government does\r\nnot recognize the four so-called \"independent\" homelands of\r\nBophuthatswana, Ciskei, Transkei, and Venda in South Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Gross domestic product (GDP): The value of all goods and\r\nservices produced domestically.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Gross national product (GNP): The value of all goods and\r\nservices produced domestically, plus income earned abroad, minus\r\nincome earned by foreigners from domestic production.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GNP/GDP methodology: In the Economy section, GNP/GDP dollar\r\nestimates for the OECD countries, the USSR, and the East European\r\ncountries are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP)\r\ncalculations rather than from conversions at official currency exchange\r\nrates. The PPP method normally involves the use of international\r\ndollar price weights, which are applied to the quantities of goods and\r\nservices produced in a given economy. In addition to the lack of\r\nreliable data from the majority of countries, the statistician faces\r\na major difficulty in specifying, identifying, and allowing for the\r\nquality of goods and services. The division of a PPP GNP/GDP estimate\r\nin dollars by the corresponding estimate in the local currency gives\r\nthe PPP conversion rate. One thousand dollars will buy the\r\nsame market basket of goods in the US as one thousand dollars, converted\r\nto the local currency at the PPP conversion rate, will buy in the other\r\ncountry. GNP/GDP estimates for the LDCs, on the other hand, are based on\r\nthe conversion of GNP/GDP estimates in local currencies to dollars at\r\nthe official currency exchange rates. One caution: the proportion of,\r\nsay, defense expenditures as a percent of GNP/GDP in local currency\r\naccounts may differ substantially from the proportion when GNP/GDP\r\naccounts are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example, when an observer\r\nestimates the dollar level of Soviet or Japanese military expenditures;\r\nsimilar problems exist when components are expressed in dollars under\r\ncurrency exchange rate procedures. Finally, as academic research\r\nmoves forward on the PPP method, we hope to convert all GNP/GDP\r\nestimates to this method in future editions of the Factbook.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Growth rate (population): The annual percent change in the\r\npopulation, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over\r\ndeaths and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country.\r\nThe rate may be positive or negative.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Illicit drugs: There are five categories of illicit\r\ndrugs--narcotics, stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens,\r\nand cannabis. These categories include many drugs legally produced and\r\nprescribed by doctors as well as those illegally produced and sold\r\noutside medical channels.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, provides\r\nhallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana (pot,\r\nAcapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, Marinol),\r\nhashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Coca (Erythroxylon coca) is a bush and the leaves contain the stimulant\r\ncocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa which comes from cacao\r\nseeds and is used in making chocolate, cocoa, and cocoa butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and\r\ninclude chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal,\r\nphenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone\r\n(Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl,\r\nValmid).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental,\r\nemotional, or behavioral change in an individual.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that\r\nresults in physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking,\r\nself-awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot),\r\nmescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine variants (PMA,\r\nSTP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog), phencyclidine analogues\r\n(PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin, psilocyn).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant\r\n(Cannabis sativa).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Marijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant\r\n(Cannabis sativa).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to\r\nopium, opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics\r\ninclude opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol),\r\ncodeine (Tylenol w/codeine, Empirin w/codeine, Robitussan A-C), and\r\nthebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics include heroin (horse, smack), and\r\nhydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic narcotics include meperidine or\r\nPethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), and\r\nothers (Darvon, Lomotil).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Opium is the milky exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the\r\nopium poppy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for many natural and\r\nsemisynthetic narcotics.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the mature dried\r\nopium poppy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha edulis\r\nthat is chewed or drunk as tea.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and\r\nactivity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines (Desoxyn,\r\nDexedrine), phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and\r\nothers (Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate).\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Infant mortality rate: The number of deaths to infants under one\r\nyear of age in a given year per l,000 live births occurring in the same\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Land use: Human use of the land surface is categorized as\r\narable land--land cultivated for crops that are replanted after\r\neach harvest (wheat, maize, rice); permanent crops--land\r\ncultivated for crops that are not replanted after each harvest\r\n(citrus, coffee, rubber); meadows and pastures--land permanently\r\nused for herbaceous forage crops; forest and woodland--land under\r\ndense or open stands of trees; and other--any land type not\r\nspecifically mentioned above (urban areas, roads, desert). The\r\npercentage figure for irrigated refers to the portion of the entire\r\namount of land area that is artificially supplied with water.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Leaders: The chief of state is the titular leader of the country\r\nwho represents the state at official and ceremonial funcions but is not\r\ninvolved with the day-to-day activities of the government. The head\r\nof government is the administrative leader who manages the day-to-day\r\nactivities of the government. In the UK, the monarch is the chief\r\nof state and the prime minister is the head of government. In the US,\r\nthe President is both the chief of state and the head of government.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Life expectancy at birth: The average number of years to be lived\r\nby a group of people all born in the same year, if mortality at each\r\nage remains constant in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Literacy: There are no universal definitions and standards of\r\nliteracy. Unless otherwise noted, all rates are based on the most\r\ncommon definition--the ability to read and write at a specified age.\r\nDetailing the standards that individual countries use to assess the\r\nability to read and write is beyond the scope of this publication.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Maps: All maps will be available only in the printed version for\r\nthe foreseeable future.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Maritime claims: The proximity of neighboring states may prevent\r\nsome national claims from being fully extended.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Merchant marine: All ships engaged in the carriage of goods. All\r\ncommercial vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships), which\r\nexcludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc. Also, a\r\ngrouping of merchant ships by nationality or register.\r\n\r\n     Captive register--A register of ships maintained by a territory,\r\npossession, or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships\r\nowned in the parent country. Also referred to as an offshore register,\r\nthe offshore equivalent of an internal register. Ships on a captive\r\nregister will fly the same flag as the parent country, or a local\r\nvariant of it, but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation\r\nrules of the offshore territory. Although the nature of a captive\r\nregister makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent\r\ncountry, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be owned\r\nabroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience\r\nregister, except that it is not the register of an independent state.\r\n\r\n     Flag of convenience register--A national register offering\r\nregistration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major\r\nflags of convenience (FOC) attract ships to their register by virtue\r\nof low fees, low or nonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal\r\nmanning requirements. True FOC registers are characterized by having\r\nrelatively few of the ships registered actually owned in the flag\r\nstate. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a\r\ngiven set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority\r\nof the merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an\r\nopen register.\r\n\r\n     Flag state--The nation in which a ship is registered and which\r\nholds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home\r\nor abroad. Differences in flag state maritime legislation determine\r\nhow a ship is manned and taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be\r\nplaced on the register.\r\n\r\n     Internal register--A register of ships maintained as a subset of\r\na national register. Ships on the internal register fly the national\r\nflag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of\r\nmaritime rules from those on the main national register. These\r\ndifferences usually include lower taxation of profits, manning by\r\nforeign nationals, and, usually, ownership outside the flag state\r\n(when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian International\r\nShip Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most\r\nnotable examples of an internal register. Both have been instrumental\r\nin stemming flight from the national flag to flags of convenience and in\r\nattracting foreign-owned ships to the Norwegian and Danish flags.\r\n\r\n     Merchant ship--A vessel that carries goods against payment of\r\nfreight. Commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately\r\nrestricted to commercial vessels only.\r\n\r\n     Register--The record of a ship's ownership and nationality as\r\nlisted with the maritime authorities of a country. Also, the\r\ncompendium of such individual ships' registrations. Registration of\r\na ship provides it with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws\r\nof the country in which registered (the flag state) regardless of the\r\nnationality of the ship's ultimate owner.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Money figures: All are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars\r\nunless otherwise indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Net migration rate: The balance between the number of persons\r\nentering and leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons\r\n(based on midyear population). An excess of persons entering the\r\ncountry is referred to as net immigration (3.56 migrants/1,000\r\npopulation); an excess of persons leaving the country as net\r\nemigration (-9.26 migrants/1,000 population).\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Population: Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census\r\nbased on statistics from population censuses, vital registration\r\nsystems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past, and on\r\nassumptions about future trends.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Total fertility rate: The average number of children that would\r\nbe born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing\r\nyears and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each age.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Years: All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless\r\nindicated as fiscal year (FY).\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Note: Information for the US and US dependencies was compiled from\r\nmaterial in the public domain and does not represent Intelligence\r\nCommunity estimates.\r\n\r\nThe Handbook of Economic Statistics, published annually in\r\nSeptember by the Central Intelligence Agency, contains detailed\r\neconomic information for the Organization for Economic Cooperation\r\nand Development (OECD) countries, Eastern Europe, the USSR,\r\nand selected other countries.

Economic considerations, however,\r\nhave played second fiddle to political and military upheavals, including\r\nthe nine-year Soviet military occupation (ended 15 February 1989) and the\r\ncontinuing bloody civil war. Over the past decade, one-third of the\r\npopulation has fled the country, with Pakistan sheltering about 3.3\r\nmillion refugees and Iran about 1.3 million. Another 1 million have\r\nprobably moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan. Large\r\nnumbers of bridges, buildings, and factories have been destroyed or\r\ndamaged by military action or sabotage. Government claims\r\nto the contrary, gross domestic product almost certainly is\r\nlower than 10 years ago because of the loss of labor and capital\r\nand the disruption of trade and transport.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $3 billion, per capita $200;

Algeria depends on hydrocarbons for nearly\r\nall of its export receipts, about 30% of government revenues, and nearly\r\n25% of GDP. In 1973-74 the sharp increase in oil prices led to a booming\r\neconomy and helped to finance an ambitious program of industrialization.\r\nPlunging oil and gas prices, combined with the mismanagement of Algeria's\r\nhighly centralized economy, have brought the nation to its most serious\r\nsocial and economic crisis since independence.

Oil\r\nproduction is the most lucrative sector of the economy, contributing\r\nabout 50% to GDP. In recent years, however, the impact of fighting an\r\ninternal war has severely affected the nonoil economy, and food has to be\r\nimported.  For the long run, Angola has the advantage of rich natural\r\nresources, notably gold, diamonds, and arable land.  To realize its\r\neconomic potential Angola not only must secure domestic peace but also\r\nmust reform government policies that have led to distortions and\r\nimbalances throughout the economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $7.9 billion, per capita $925;

The year in parentheses indicates when an acceding\r\nnation was voted to full consultative (voting) status, while no date\r\nindicates an original 1959 treaty signatory. Claimant nations\r\nare--Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and the\r\nUK. Nonclaimant consultative nations are--Belgium, Brazil (1983),\r\nChina (1985), Ecuador (1990), Finland (1989), Germany (1981), India\r\n(1983), Italy (1987), Japan, South Korea (1989), Netherlands (1990), Peru\r\n(1989), Poland (1977), South Africa, Spain (1988), Sweden (1988), Uruguay\r\n(1985), the US, and the USSR.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Acceding (nonvoting) members, with year of accession in parenthesis,\r\nare--Austria (1987), Bulgaria (1978), Canada (1988), Colombia (1988),\r\nCuba (1984), Czechoslovakia (1962), Denmark (1965), Greece (1987),\r\nHungary (1984), North Korea (1987), Papua New Guinea (1981), Romania\r\n(1971), and Switzerland (1990).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Antarctic Treaty Summary:\r\n\r\nArticle 1--area to be used for peaceful purposes only; military\r\nactivity, such as weapons testing, is prohibited, but military personnel\r\nand equipment may be used for peaceful scientific and logistics purposes;\r\n\r\nArticle 2--freedom of scientific investigation and cooperation\r\nshall continue;\r\n\r\nArticle 3--free exchange of information and personnel in\r\ncooperation with the UN and other international agencies;\r\n\r\nArticle 4--does not recognize, dispute, or establish territorial\r\nclaims and no new claims shall be asserted while the treaty is in force;\r\n\r\nArticle 5--prohibits nuclear explosions or disposal of radioactive\r\nwastes;\r\n\r\nArticle 6--includes under the treaty all land and ice shelves\r\nsouth of 60o 00%19 south, but that the water areas be covered by\r\ninternational law;\r\n\r\nArticle 7--treaty-state observers have free access, including\r\naerial observation, to any area and may inspect all stations,\r\ninstallations, and equipment; advance notice of all activities\r\nand the introduction of military personnel must be given;\r\n\r\nArticle 8--allows for jurisdiction over observers and scientists\r\nby their own states;\r\n\r\nArticle 9--frequent consultative meetings take place among\r\nmember nations;\r\n\r\nArticle 10--treaty states will discourage activities by any\r\ncountry in Antarctica that are contrary to the treaty;\r\n\r\nArticle 11--disputes to be settled peacefully by the parties\r\nconcerned or, ultimately, by the ICJ;\r\n\r\nArticles 12, 13, 14--deal with upholding, interpreting, and\r\namending the treaty among involved nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Other agreements: more than 150 recommendations adopted at\r\ntreaty consultative meetings and ratified by governments\r\ninclude--Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and\r\nFlora (1964); Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (1972);\r\nConvention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources\r\n(1980); a mineral resources agreement was signed in 1988 but was\r\nsubsequently rejected by some signatories and is likely to be replaced in\r\n1991 by a comprehensive environmental protection agreement that defers\r\nminerals development for a long period.\r\n\r\n\r\n_*_Economy\r\n_#_Overview: No economic activity at present except for fishing off\r\nthe coast and small-scale tourism, both based abroad.

Thanks to an excellent raw material endowment, a\r\ntechnically skilled labor force, and strong links to West German\r\nindustrial firms, Austria has successfully occupied specialized niches\r\nin European industry and services (tourism, banking) and produces almost\r\nenough food to feed itself with only 8% of the labor force in\r\nagriculture. Improved export prospects from German unification\r\nand the opening of Eastern Europe will also boost the economy during\r\nthe next few years. Living standards are roughly comparable with the\r\nlarge industrial countries of Western Europe. Problems for the l990s\r\ninclude an aging population, the high level of subsidies, and the\r\nstruggle to keep welfare benefits within budget capabilities. Austria,\r\nwhich has applied for EC membership, is currently involved in EC and\r\nEuropean Free Trade Association negotiations for a European Economic\r\nArea and will have to adapt its economy to achieve freer movement of\r\ngoods, services, capital, and labor with the EC.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $111.0 billion, per capita $14,500;

Bangladesh is hampered by a relative\r\nlack of natural resources, population growth of more than 2% a year,\r\nlarge-scale unemployment, and a limited infrastructure; furthermore,\r\nit is highly vulnerable to natural disasters. Despite these constraints,\r\nreal GDP growth averaged about 3.5% annually during 1985-89. A strong\r\nagricultural performance in FY90 pushed the growth rate up to 5.5%.\r\nAlleviation of poverty remains the cornerstone of the government's\r\ndevelopment strategy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $20.4 billion, per capita $180;

The economy is closely\r\naligned with that of India through strong trade and monetary links.\r\nLow wages in industry lead most Bhutanese to stay in agriculture.\r\nMost development projects, such as road construction, rely on Indian\r\nmigrant labor.

An austere\r\northodox economic program adopted by newly elected President Paz\r\nEstenssoro in 1985, however, succeeded in reducing inflation to between\r\n10% and 20% annually since 1987, eventually restarting economic growth.\r\nPresident Paz Zamora has retained the economic policies of the previous\r\ngovernment, keeping inflation down and continuing the moderate growth\r\nbegun under his predecessor. Nevertheless, Bolivia continues to be one of\r\nthe poorest countries in Latin America, and it remains vulnerable to\r\nprice fluctuations for its limited exports--agricultural products,\r\nminerals, and natural gas.

Agriculture today provides a livelihood for over 80% of the\r\npopulation, but produces only about 50% of food needs and contributes\r\na small 3% to GDP. The driving force behind the rapid economic growth of\r\nthe 1970s and 1980s has been the mining industry. This sector, mostly on\r\nthe strength of diamonds, has gone from generating 25% of GDP in 1980 to\r\nover 50% in 1989. No other sector has experienced such growth, especially\r\nnot agriculture, which is plagued by erratic rainfall and poor soils. The\r\nunemployment rate remains a problem at 25%.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $3.1 billion, per capita $2,500; real growth rate 6.3%\r\n(1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 12.0% (1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: 25% (1989)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $1,719 million;

In addition, the economy remained highly\r\nregulated, inward-looking, and protected by substantial trade and\r\ninvestment barriers. Ownership of major industrial and mining facilities\r\nis divided among private interests--including several multinationals--and\r\nthe government. Most large agricultural holdings are private, with the\r\ngovernment channeling financing to this sector. Conflicts between large\r\nlandholders and landless peasants have produced intermittent violence.\r\nThe government is seeking an IMF standby loan despite several failed\r\nagreements over the past decade. Relations with foreign commercial\r\nbanks remain strained because of mounting interest arrears on Brazil's\r\nlong-term debt. The Collor government, which assumed office in March\r\n1990, is embarked on an ambitious reform program that seeks to\r\nmodernize and reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices,\r\nderegulating the economy, and opening it to increased foreign\r\ncompetition. A major long-run strength is Brazil's vast natural\r\nresources.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $388 billion, per capita $2,540; real growth rate - 4.6%\r\n(1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 1,795% (December 1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: 4.4% (1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $36.5 billion;

By 1990 Sofia's foreign debt had\r\nskyrocketed to over $10 billion--giving a debt service ratio of more\r\nthan 40% of hard currency earnings and leading the regime to declare\r\na moratorium on its hard currency payments. The post-Zhivkov regime\r\nfaces major problems of renovating an aging industrial plant;\r\ncoping with worsening energy, food, and consumer goods shortages;\r\nkeeping abreast of rapidly unfolding technological developments;\r\ninvesting in additional energy capacity (the portion of electric\r\npower from nuclear energy reached over one-third in 1990); and\r\nmotivating workers, in part by giving them a share in the earnings of\r\ntheir enterprises. A major decree of January 1989 summarized and\r\nextended the government's economic restructuring efforts, which include\r\na partial decentralization of controls over production decisions and\r\nforeign trade. In October 1990 the Lukanov government proposed an\r\neconomic reform program based on a US Chamber of Commerce study. It was\r\nnever instituted because of a political stalemate between the BSP and the\r\nUDF. The new Popov government launched a similar reform program in\r\nJanuary 1991, but full implementation has been slowed by continuing\r\npolitical disputes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GNP: $47.3 billion, per capita $5,300;

The nation has been unable to achieve any substantial\r\nimprovement in export earnings because of falling prices for many\r\nof its major commodity exports. For rice, traditionally the most\r\nimportant export, the drop in world prices has been accompanied by\r\nshrinking markets and a smaller volume of sales. In 1985 teak replaced\r\nrice as the largest export and continues to hold this position.

The\r\neconomy is based on agriculture and related industries.  Over the\r\npast decade Cambodia has been slowly recovering from its near destruction\r\nby war and political upheaval. It still remains, however, one of the\r\nworld's poorest countries, with an estimated per capita GDP of about\r\n$130.  The food situation is precarious; during the 1980s famine has\r\nbeen averted only through international relief. In 1986 the production\r\nlevel of rice, the staple food crop, was able to meet only 80% of\r\ndomestic needs. The biggest success of the nation's recovery program has\r\nbeen in new rubber plantings and in fishing. Industry, other than rice\r\nprocessing, is almost nonexistent. Foreign trade is primarily with the\r\nUSSR and Vietnam. Statistical data on the economy continues to be sparse\r\nand unreliable. Foreign aid from the USSR and Eastern Europe almost\r\ncertainly is being slashed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $890 million, per capita $130; real growth rate 0% (1989 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $NA;

Real GDP growth annually averaged 10% from 1978 to 1985. In\r\n1986 Cameroon had one of the highest levels of income per capita in\r\ntropical Africa, with oil revenues picking up the slack as growth in\r\nother sectors softened. Because of the sharp drop in oil prices, however,\r\nthe economy experienced serious budgetary difficulties and\r\nbalance-of-payments disequilibrium. Despite the recent upsurge in oil\r\nprices, Cameroon's economic outlook is troubled. Oil reserves currently\r\nbeing exploited will be depleted in the early 1990s, so ways must be\r\nfound to boost agricultural and industrial exports in the medium term.\r\nThe Sixth Cameroon Development Plan (1986-91) stresses balanced\r\ndevelopment and designates agriculture as the basis of the country's\r\neconomic future.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $11.5 billion, per capita $1,040;

Since World War II the\r\nimpressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has\r\ntransformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one primarily\r\nindustrial and urban. In the 1980s Canada registered one of the highest\r\nrates of real growth among the OECD nations, averaging about 3.2%. With\r\nits great natural resources, skilled labor force, and modern capital\r\nplant, Canada has excellent economic prospects. In mid-1990, however, the\r\nlong-simmering problems between English- and French-speaking areas\r\nbecame so acute that observers spoke openly of a possible split in the\r\nconfederation; foreign investors were becoming edgy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $516.7 billion, per capita $19,500;

The economy is\r\nservice oriented, with commerce, transport, and public services\r\naccounting for 65% of GDP during the period 1985-88. Although nearly\r\n70% of the population lives in rural areas, agriculture's share of GDP is\r\nonly 16%; the fishing sector accounts for 4%. About 90% of food must be\r\nimported. The fishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully\r\nexploited. In 1988 fishing represented only 3.5% of GDP. Cape Verde\r\nannually runs a high trade deficit, financed by remittances from\r\nemigrants and foreign aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $262 million, per capita $740; real growth rate 3.2%\r\n(1988 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 8.2% (1988 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: 25% (1988)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $98.3 million;

In 1988 the agricultural sector generated\r\nabout 40% of GDP. Agricultural products accounted for about 60% of export\r\nearnings and the diamond industry for 30%. Important constraints to\r\neconomic development include the CAR's landlocked position, a poor\r\ntransportation infrastructure, and a weak human resource base.\r\nMultilateral and bilateral development assistance plays a major role in\r\nproviding capital for new investment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $1.3 billion, per capita $440;

Monetary policy was not\r\nsuccessful at slowing price increases until the end of the year,\r\nhowever, and inflation, stimulated by higher world oil prices,\r\nincreased to 27.3% in 1990 from 21.4% in 1989. Copper prices held strong\r\nin 1990, helping to maintain a balance-of-payments surplus and increase\r\ninternational reserves. Most observers expect that inflationary\r\npressures have run their course and price increases will slow during\r\n1991, contributing to growth of 4-5%.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $26 billion, per capita $2,000;

The most gratifying result has been a\r\nstrong spurt in production, particularly in agriculture in the early\r\n1980s. Otherwise, the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid\r\nsystem the worst results of socialism (bureaucracy, lassitude,\r\ncorruption) and of capitalism (windfall gains and stepped-up inflation).\r\nBeijing thus has periodically backtracked, retightening central controls\r\nat intervals and thereby undermining the credibility of the reform\r\nprocess. Popular resistance and changes in central policy have\r\nweakened China's population control program, which is essential to the\r\nnation's long-term economic viability.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GNP: $413 billion (1989 est.), per capita $370 (World Bank est.);\r\nreal growth rate 5% (1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 2.1% (1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: 2.6% in urban areas (1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $NA;

The rapid development of oil, coal, and other\r\nnontraditional industries over the past four years has helped to offset\r\nthe decline in coffee prices--Colombia's major export. The collapse of\r\nthe International Coffee Agreement in the summer of 1989, a troublesome\r\nrural insurgency, and drug-related violence dampen prospects for future\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $43.0 billion, per capita $1,300;

The low\r\neducational level of the labor force contributes to a low level of\r\neconomic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign\r\ngrants and technical assistance. Agriculture, including fishing and\r\nforestry, is the leading sector of the economy. It contributes about 40%\r\nto GDP, employs 80% of the labor force, and provides most of the exports.\r\nThe country is not self-sufficient in food production, and rice, the main\r\nstaple, accounts for 90% of imports. During the period 1982-86 the\r\nindustrial sector grew at an annual average rate of 5.3%, but its\r\ncontribution to GDP was only 5% in 1988. Despite major investment in the\r\ntourist industry, which accounts for about 25% of GDP, growth has\r\nstagnated since 1983. A sluggish growth rate of 1.5% during 1985-90 has\r\nled to large budget deficits, declining incomes, and balance-of-payments\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $245 million, per capita $530; real growth rate 1.5% (1990\r\nest.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 2.9% (1989)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: over 16% (1988 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $88 million;

Sugar\r\nprovides about 75% of export revenues and over half is exported to the\r\nUSSR. The economy has stagnated since 1985 under policies that have\r\ndeemphasized material incentives in the workplace, abolished farmers'\r\ninformal produce markets, and raised prices of government-supplied goods\r\nand services. In 1990 the economy probably fell 3%, largely as a result\r\nof declining trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Recently\r\nthe government has been trying to increase trade with Latin America and\r\nChina. Cuba has had difficulty servicing its foreign debt since 1982. The\r\ngovernment currently is encouraging foreign investment in tourist\r\nfacilities. Other investment priorities include sugar, basic foods, and\r\nnickel. The annual $4 billion Soviet subsidy, a main prop to Cuba's\r\nthreadbare economy, is likely to show a substantial decline over the\r\nnext few years in view of the USSR's mounting economic problems. Instead\r\nof highly subsidized trade, Cuba will be shifting to trade at market\r\nprices in convertible currencies. In early 1991, the shortages of fuels,\r\nspare parts, and industrial products in general had become so severe as\r\nto amount to a deindustrialization process in the eyes of some observers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GNP: $20.9 billion, per capita $2,000;

Its industry, transport, energy\r\nsources, banking, and most other means of production are state owned. The\r\ncountry is deficient, however, in energy and in many raw materials.\r\nMoreover, its aging capital plant lags well behind West European\r\nstandards. Industry contributes almost 50% to GNP and construction\r\ncontributes 10%. About 95% of agricultural land is in collectives or\r\nstate farms. The centrally planned economy has been tightly linked in\r\ntrade (80%) to the USSR and Eastern Europe. Growth has been sluggish,\r\naveraging less than 2% in the period 1982-89. GNP per capita is the\r\nhighest in Eastern Europe. As in the rest of Eastern Europe, the sweeping\r\npolitical changes of 1989-90 have been disrupting normal channels of\r\nsupply and compounding the government's economic problems.

In 1990 Denmark had the lowest inflation rate in the EC,\r\na record trade surplus, and the first balance-of-payments surplus in\r\n26 years.

Djibouti provides services as both a transit port\r\nfor the region and an international transshipment and refueling center.\r\nIt has few natural resources and little industry. The nation is,\r\ntherefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance to help support its\r\nbalance of payments and to finance development projects. An unemployment\r\nrate of over 40% continues to be a major problem. Per capita\r\nconsumption dropped an estimated 35% over the last five years with\r\na population growth rate of 6% (including immigrants and refugees) and a\r\nrecession.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $340 million, $1,030 per capita;

Agriculture accounts for about\r\n30% of GDP and employs 40% of the labor force. Principal products include\r\nbananas, citrus, mangoes, root crops, and coconuts. In 1988 the economy\r\nachieved a 5.6% growth in real GDP on the strength of a boost in\r\nconstruction, higher agricultural production, and growth of the small\r\nmanufacturing sector based on the soap and garment industries. In 1989,\r\nhowever, Hurricane Hugo wiped out 70% of the banana crop and affected\r\nother economic activity. The tourist industry remains undeveloped because\r\nof a rugged coastline and the lack of an international-class airport.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $153 million, per capita $1,840; real growth rate - 1.7%\r\n(1989 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 6.3% (1989)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: 10% (1989 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $48 million;

Rapid growth of free trade zones has established a significant\r\nexpansion of manufacturing for export, especially wearing apparel.\r\nOver the past decade tourism has also increased in importance and is a\r\nmajor earner of foreign exchange and a source of new jobs. Agriculture\r\nremains a key sector of the economy. The principal commercial crop is\r\nsugarcane, followed by coffee, cotton, cocoa, and tobacco. Domestic\r\nindustry is based on the processing of agricultural products, durable\r\nconsumer goods, minerals, and chemicals.

Overregulation holds back technical modernization and\r\nforeign investment. Even so, the economy grew rapidly during the late\r\n1970s and early 1980s, but in 1986 the collapse of world oil prices\r\nand an increasingly heavy burden of debt servicing led Egypt to begin\r\nnegotiations with the IMF for balance-of-payments support. As part of\r\nthe 1987 agreement with the IMF, the government agreed to institute\r\na reform program to reduce inflation, promote economic growth, and\r\nimprove its external position. The reforms have been slow in coming,\r\nhowever, and the economy has been largely stagnant for the past\r\nthree years. The addition of 1 million people every seven months\r\nto Egypt's population exerts enormous pressure on the 5% of the total\r\nland area available for agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $37.0 billion, per capita $700;

A few dairy herds are kept to\r\nmeet domestic consumption of milk and milk products, and crops grown are\r\nprimarily those for providing winter fodder. Exports feature shipments\r\nof high-grade wool to the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins.\r\nRich stocks of fish in the surrounding waters are not presently exploited\r\nby the islanders. So far efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry\r\nhave been unsuccessful. In 1987 the government began selling\r\nfishing licenses to foreign trawlers operating within the Falklands\r\nexclusive fishing zone. These license fees amount to more than $40\r\nmillion per year and are a primary source of income for the\r\ngovernment. To encourage tourism, the Falkland Islands Development\r\nCorporation has built three lodges for visitors attracted by the\r\nabundant wildlife and trout fishing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $NA, per capita $NA;

When the nations of the world extended their fishing\r\nzones to 200 nautical miles in the early 1970s, the Faroese\r\nno longer could continue their traditional long-distance fishing\r\nand subsequently depleted their own nearby fishing areas; one\r\nestimate foresaw a 25% drop in fish catch in 1990 alone. Half the\r\nfishing fleet is for sale, and the 22 fish-processing plants work\r\nat only half capacity. The government no longer can maintain its\r\nhigh level of spending on roads and tunnels, hospitals, sports\r\nfacilities, and other social welfare programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $662 million, per capita $14,000;

Sugar exports are a major source of foreign exchange\r\nand sugar processing accounts for one-third of industrial output.\r\nIndustry, including sugar milling, contributes 13% to GDP. Fiji\r\ntraditionally had earned considerable sums of hard currency from the\r\n250,000 tourists who visited each year. In 1987, however, after two\r\nmilitary coups, the economy went into decline. GDP dropped by 7.8% in\r\n1987 and by another 2.5% in 1988; political uncertainty created a drop in\r\ntourism, and the worst drought of the century caused sugar production\r\nto fall sharply. In contrast, sugar and tourism turned in strong\r\nperformances in 1989, and the economy rebounded vigorously. In 1990\r\nthe economy received a setback from cyclone Sina which cut sugar\r\noutput by an estimated 21%.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $1.3 billion, per capita $1,693; real growth rate 3.5%\r\n(1991 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 8.5% (1991 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: 5.9 (1991 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $314 million;

Trade is important, with\r\nthe export of goods representing about 30% of GDP. Except for timber and\r\nseveral minerals, Finland depends on imported raw materials, energy, and\r\nsome components of manufactured goods. Because of the climate,\r\nagricultural development is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in\r\nbasic commodities. The economy, which experienced an average of 4.9%\r\nannual growth between 1987 and 1989, leveled off in 1990 and is now\r\nin a recession facing negative growth in 1991. The clearing account\r\nsystem between Finland and the Soviet Union in the postwar period--mainly\r\nSoviet oil and gas for Finnish manufactured goods--had kept Finland\r\nisolated from world recessions; the system, however, was dismantled on\r\n1 January 1991 in favor of hard currency trade. As a result, Finland must\r\nincrease its competitiveness in certain sectors, for example, textiles,\r\nfoodstuffs, paper, and metals, and has already begun to shift trade\r\nwestward. Finland, as a member of EFTA, is negotiating a European\r\nEconomic Area arrangement with the EC which would allow for free\r\nmovement of capital, goods, services, and labor within the organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $77.3 billion, per capita $15,500;

Large tracts of fertile land, the application of\r\nmodern technology, and subsidies have combined to make it the leading\r\nagricultural producer in Western Europe. France is largely\r\nself-sufficient in agricultural products and is a major exporter of\r\nwheat and dairy products. The industrial sector generates about\r\none-quarter of GDP, and the growing services sector has become crucial\r\nto the economy. After sluggish growth during the period 1982-87, the\r\neconomy expanded at a rapid 3.8% pace in 1988-89. The economy\r\nslowed down in 1990, with growth of 2.0% expected in 1991.\r\nThe economy has had difficulty generating enough jobs for new\r\nentrants into the labor force, resulting in a high unemployment rate,\r\nwhich probably will rise to around 10% during the slowdown.\r\nThe steadily advancing economic integration within the European\r\nCommunity is a major force affecting the fortunes of the various economic\r\nsectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $873.5 billion, per capita $15,500;

Besides the French space center at Kourou, fishing\r\nand forestry are the most important economic activities, with exports\r\nof fish and fish products (mostly shrimp) accounting for more than 60%\r\nof total revenue in 1987. The large reserves of tropical hardwoods, not\r\nfully exploited, support an expanding sawmill industry that provides sawn\r\nlogs for export. Cultivation of crops--rice, cassava, bananas, and\r\nsugarcane--are limited to the coastal area, where the population is\r\nlargely concentrated.

During the period\r\n1981-85 oil accounted for about 46% of GDP, 83% of export earnings, and\r\n65% of government revenues on average. The high oil prices of the early\r\n1980s contributed to a substantial increase in per capita income,\r\nstimulated domestic demand, reinforced migration from rural to urban\r\nareas, and raised the level of real wages to among the highest in\r\nSub-Saharan Africa. The three-year slide of Gabon's economy, which\r\nbegan with falling oil prices in 1985, was reversed in 1989 because of a\r\nnear doubling of oil prices over their 1988 lows.

It is one of the world's\r\npoorest countries with a per capita income of about $230. About 75%\r\nof the population is engaged in crop production and livestock raising,\r\nwhich contributes 30% to GDP. Small-scale manufacturing\r\nactivity--processing peanuts, fish, and hides--accounts for less than\r\n10% of GDP. Tourism is a growing industry. The Gambia imports\r\none-third of its food, all fuel, and most manufactured goods. Exports\r\nare concentrated on peanut products (about 75% of total value).\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $195 million, per capita $230; real growth rate 6.0% (FY90\r\nest.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 6.0% (FY91)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $79 million; expenditures $84 million,\r\nincluding capital expenditures of $21 million (FY90)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Exports: $116 million (f.o.b., FY90);\r\n\r\ncommodities--peanuts and peanut products, fish, cotton lint, palm\r\nkernels;\r\n\r\npartners--Japan 60%, Europe 29%, Africa 5%, US 1% other 5% (1989)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Imports: $147 million (f.o.b., FY90);\r\n\r\ncommodities--foodstuffs, manufactures, raw materials, fuel,\r\nmachinery and transport equipment;\r\n\r\npartners--Europe 57%, Asia 25%, USSR/EE 9%, US 6%, other 3%\r\n(1989)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_External debt: $336 million (December 1990 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Industrial production: growth rate 6.7%; accounts for 5.8%\r\nof GDP (FY90)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Electricity: 29,000 kW capacity; 64 million kWh produced, 80 kWh\r\nper capita (1989)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Industries: peanut processing, tourism, beverages, agricultural\r\nmachinery assembly, woodworking, metalworking, clothing\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Agriculture: accounts for 30% of GDP and employs about 75% of the\r\npopulation; imports one-third of food requirements; major export crop is\r\npeanuts; the principal crops--millet, sorghum, rice, corn, cassava,\r\npalm kernels; livestock--cattle, sheep, and goats; forestry and fishing\r\nresources not fully exploited\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Economic aid: US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-89), $93\r\nmillion; Western (non-US) countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments\r\n(1970-88), $492 million; Communist countries (1970-88), $39 million\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Currency: dalasi (plural--dalasi); 1 dalasi (D) = 100 bututs\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Exchange rates: dalasi (D) per US$1--7.610 (January 1991),\r\n7.883 (1990), 7.5846 (1989), 6.7086 (1988), 7.0744 (1987),\r\n6.9380 (1986), 3.8939 (1985)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Fiscal year: 1 July-30 June\r\n\r\n\r\n_*_Communications\r\n_#_Highways: 3,083 km total; 431 km paved, 501 km gravel/laterite,\r\nand 2,151 km unimproved earth\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inland waterways: 400 km\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Ports: Banjul\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Civil air: 2 major transport aircraft\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Airports: 1 with permanent-surface runway 2,440-3,659 m\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Telecommunications: adequate network of radio relay and wire;\r\n3,500 telephones; stations--3 AM, 2 FM, 1 TV; 1 Atlantic Ocean\r\nINTELSAT earth station\r\n\r\n\r\n_*_Defense Forces\r\n_#_Branches: Army, Navy, paramilitary Gendarmerie, National Police\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Manpower availability: males 15-49, 188,393; 95,133 fit for\r\nmilitary service\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Defense expenditures: $NA, 0.7% of GDP (1988)\r\n_%_\r\n_@_Gaza Strip\r\n_#_Note: The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967\r\nended with Israel in control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the\r\nSinai, and the Golan Heights. As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords\r\nand reaffirmed by President Reagan's 1 September 1982 peace initiative,\r\nthe final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship\r\nwith their neighbors, and a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to\r\nbe negotiated among the concerned parties. Camp David further specifies\r\nthat these negotiations will resolve the respective boundaries. Pending\r\nthe completion of this process, it is US policy that the final status of\r\nthe West Bank and the Gaza Strip has yet to be determined. In the view of\r\nthe US, the term West Bank describes all of the area west of the Jordan\r\nunder Jordanian administration before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. With\r\nrespect to negotiations envisaged in the framework agreement, however, it\r\nis US policy that a distinction must be made between Jerusalem and the\r\nrest of the West Bank because of the city's special status and\r\ncircumstances. Therefore, a negotiated solution for the final status of\r\nJerusalem could be different in character from that of the rest of the\r\nWest Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n_*_Geography\r\n_#_Total area: 380km2; land area: 380 km2\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Comparative area: slightly more than twice the size of Washington,\r\nDC\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Land boundaries: 62 km total; Egypt 11 km, Israel 51 km\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Coastline: 40 km\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Maritime claims: Israeli occupied with status to be determined\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Disputes: Israeli occupied with status to be determined\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Climate: temperate, mild winters, dry and warm to hot summers\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Terrain: flat to rolling, sand and dune covered coastal plain\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Natural resources: negligible\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Land use: arable land 13%, permanent crops 32%, meadows and\r\npastures 0%, forest and woodland 0%, other 55%\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Environment: desertification\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Note: there are 18 Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip\r\n\r\n\r\n_*_People\r\n_#_Population: 642,253 (July 1991), growth rate 3.2% (1991);\r\nin addition, there are 2,500 Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip (1990\r\nest.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Birth rate: 43 births/1,000 population (1991)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Death rate: 6 deaths/1,000 population (1991)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Net migration rate: - 5 migrants/1,000 population (1991)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Infant mortality rate: 41 deaths/1,000 live births (1991)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Life expectancy at birth: 65 years male, 67 years female (1991)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Total fertility rate: 6.9 children born/woman (1991)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Nationality: NA\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Ethnic divisions: Palestinian Arab and other 99.8%, Jewish 0.2%\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Religion: Muslim (predominantly Sunni) 99%, Christian 0.7%,\r\nJewish 0.3%\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Language: Arabic, Israeli settlers speak Hebrew, English widely\r\nunderstood\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Literacy: NA% (male NA%, female NA%)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Labor force: (excluding Israeli Jewish settlers) small\r\nindustry, commerce and business 32.0%, construction 24.4%, service\r\nand other 25.5%, and agriculture 18.1% (1984)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Organized labor: NA\r\n\r\n\r\n_*_Government\r\n_#_Long-form name: none\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Note: The Gaza Strip is currently governed by Israeli military\r\nauthorities and Israeli civil administration.

The once dominant agricultural sector now contributes\r\nonly 13% to GNP, about the same as that of the construction sector, and\r\nindustry accounts for 7%. Gaza depends upon Israel for 90% of its\r\nimports and as a market for 80% of its exports. Unrest in the territory\r\nin 1988-91 (intifadah) has raised unemployment and substantially\r\nlowered the incomes of the population. Furthermore, the Persian Gulf\r\ncrisis dealt a severe blow to the Gaza Strip in 1990 and on into 1991.\r\nWorker remittances from the Gulf states have plunged, unemployment has\r\nincreased, and export revenues have fallen dramatically.

Western Germany has an advanced market economy\r\nand is a leading exporter. It experienced faster-than-projected real\r\ngrowth largely because of demand in eastern Germany for western German\r\ngoods. Western Germany has a highly urbanized and skilled population\r\nwhich enjoys excellent living standards, abundant leisure time, and\r\ncomprehensive social welfare benefits. Western Germany is relatively\r\npoor in natural resources, coal being the most important mineral.\r\nWestern Germany's world-class companies manufacture technologically\r\nadvanced goods. The region's economy is mature: manufacturing and service\r\nindustries account for the dominant share of economic activity, and raw\r\nmaterials and semimanufactured products constitute a large proportion of\r\nimports. In 1989 manufacturing accounted for 31% of GDP, with other\r\nsectors contributing lesser amounts. In recent years, gross fixed\r\ninvestment has accounted for about 21% of GDP. In 1990 GDP in the western\r\nregion was an estimated $16,300 per capita.\r\n\r\n    In contrast, eastern Germany's obsolete command economy, once\r\ndominated by smokestack heavy industries, has been undergoing a\r\nwrenching change to a market economy. Industrial production in early\r\n1991 is down 50% from the same period last year, due largely to the\r\nslump in domestic demand for eastern German-made goods and the ongoing\r\neconomic restructuring. The FRG's legal, social welfare, and economic\r\nsystems have been extended to the east, but economic\r\nrestructuring--privatizing industry, establishing clear property rights,\r\nclarifying responsibility for environmental clean-up, and removing\r\nCommunist-era holdovers from management--is proceeding slowly\r\nso far, deterring outside investors. The region is one of the world's\r\nlargest producers of low-grade lignite coal, but has few other resources.\r\nThe quality of statistics from eastern Germany remains poor; Bonn is\r\nstill trying to bring statistics for the region in line with West German\r\npractices.\r\n\r\n    The most challenging economic problem of a united Germany is the\r\nreconstruction of eastern Germany's economy--specifically, finding the\r\nright mix of fiscal, regulatory, monetary, and tax policies that\r\nwill spur investment in the east without derailing western Germany's\r\nhealthy economy or damaging relations with Western partners. The\r\nbiggest danger is that soaring unemployment in eastern Germany, which\r\ncould climb to the 30 to 40% range, could touch off labor disputes\r\nor renewed mass relocation to western Germany and erode investor\r\nconfidence in eastern Germany. Overall economic activity grew an\r\nestimated 4.6% in western Germany in 1990, while dropping roughly 15% in\r\neastern Germany. Per capita GDP in the eastern region was approximately\r\n$8,700 in 1990.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $1,157.2 billion, per capita $14,600; real growth rate 1.7%\r\n(1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices):\r\nWest--3.0% (1989);\r\nEast--0.8% (1989)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate:\r\nWest--7.1% (1990);\r\nEast--1% (1989);

Mitsotakis inherited several\r\nsevere economic problems from the preceding socialist and caretaker\r\ngovernments, which neglected the runaway budget deficit, a ballooning\r\ncurrent account deficit, and accelerating inflation. With only a\r\ntwo-seat majority in the Chamber of Deputies, Mitsotakis has concentrated\r\non cutting the public-sector payroll, cautiously expanding the tax base,\r\nand adopting guidelines for privatizing Greece's loss-ridden state-owned\r\nenterprises. Once the political situation is sorted out, Greece will have\r\nto face the challenges posed by the steadily increasing integration of\r\nthe European Community, including the progressive lowering of trade and\r\ninvestment barriers. Tourism continues as a major industry, providing a\r\nvital offset to the sizable commodity trade deficit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $76.7 billion, per capita $7,650; real growth rate 0.9%\r\n(1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 19.0% (1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: 9.0% (1989)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $20.9 billion;

Fishing is still the most important industry,\r\naccounting for over 75% of exports and about 25% of the\r\npopulation's income. Maintenance of a social welfare system similar to\r\nDenmark's has given the public sector a dominant role in the economy.\r\nIn 1990, the economy became critically dependent on shrimp exports and an\r\nannual subsidy (now about $355 million) from the Danish Government\r\nbecause cod exports had fallen, the zinc and lead mine closed, and\r\na large promising platinum and gold mine was not yet operational.\r\nGreenland has signed a contract for its largest construction project,\r\na power plant to supply the capital. To avoid a decline in the economy,\r\nDenmark has agreed to pay 75% of the costs of running Sondrestrom\r\nAirbase and Kulusuk Airfield as civilian bases after the US withdraws\r\nin 1992.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GNP: $500 million, per capita $9,000;

It is also dependent upon France for large\r\nsubsidies and imports. Tourism is a key industry, with most tourists from\r\nthe US. In addition, an increasingly large number of cruise ships visit\r\nthe islands. The traditionally important sugarcane crop is slowly being\r\nreplaced by other crops, such as bananas (which now supply about 50% of\r\nexport earnings), eggplant, and flowers. Other vegetables and root crops\r\nare cultivated for local consumption, although Guadeloupe is still\r\ndependent on imported food, which comes mainly from France. Light\r\nindustry consists mostly of sugar and rum production. Most manufactured\r\ngoods and fuel are imported. Unemployment is especially high among the\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $1.1 billion, per capita $3,300; real growth rate NA% (1987)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 2.3% (1988)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: 38% (1987)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $254 million;

The decline resulted from\r\nbad weather, labor trouble in the canefields, and flooding and equipment\r\nproblems in the bauxite industry. Consumer prices rose about 35% in 1988\r\nand by over 100% in 1989, and the current account deficit widened\r\nsubstantially as sugar and bauxite exports fell. Moreover, electric\r\npower is in short supply and constitutes a major barrier to future gains\r\nin national output. The government, in association with international\r\nfinancial agencies, seeks to reduce its payment arrears and to raise new\r\nfunds. The government's stabilization program--aimed at establishing\r\nrealistic exchange rates, reasonable price stability, and a resumption of\r\ngrowth--requires considerable public administrative abilities and\r\ncontinued patience by consumers during a long incubation period.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $287.2 million, per capita $380;

Agriculture, the most important sector of the economy,\r\naccounts for nearly 30% of GDP, employs 62% of the labor force, and\r\nproduces two-thirds of exports. Productivity remains low. Industry,\r\nstill in its early stages, employs nearly 9% of the labor force,\r\naccounts for 15% of GDP, and generates 20% of exports. The service\r\nsectors, including public administration, account for 50% of GDP and\r\nemploy nearly 20% of the labor force.  Basic problems facing the\r\neconomy include rapid population growth, high unemployment, sharply\r\nincreased inflation, a lack of basic services, a large and inefficient\r\npublic sector, and the dependence of the export sector mostly on coffee\r\nand bananas, which are subject to sharp price fluctuations.

Natural resources are limited, and food and raw\r\nmaterials must be imported. Manufacturing accounts for about 18% of\r\nGDP, employs 28% of the labor force, and exports about 90% of its\r\noutput. Real GDP growth averaged a remarkable 8% in 1987-88, then\r\nslowed to 2.5-3.0% in 1989-90. Unemployment, which has been declining\r\nsince the mid-1980s, is now less than 2%.

Industry accounts for\r\nabout 40% of GNP and 30% of employment. About 40% of Hungary's foreign\r\ntrade is with the USSR and Eastern Europe and a third is with the EC.\r\nLow rates of growth reflect the inability of the Soviet-style economy to\r\nmodernize capital plant and motivate workers. GNP declined by 1% in 1989\r\nand by an estimated 6% in 1990. Since 1985 external debt has more than\r\ndoubled, to over $20 billion. In recent years Hungary has experimented\r\nwidely with decentralized and market-oriented enterprises. The newly\r\ndemocratic government has renounced the Soviet economic growth model and\r\nplans to open the economy to wider market forces and to much closer\r\neconomic relations with Western Europe. Prime Minister Antall has\r\ndeclared his intention to move foward on privatization of state\r\nenterprises, provision for bankruptcy, land reform, and marketization of\r\ninternational trade, but concerns over acceptable levels of unemployment\r\nand inflation may slow the reform process.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GNP: $60.9 billion, per capita $5,800;

The economy\r\nis heavily dependent on the fishing industry, which provides nearly 75%\r\nof export earnings. In the absence of other natural resources, Iceland's\r\neconomy is vulnerable to changing world fish prices. As a result of\r\nclimbing fish prices in 1990 and a noninflationary labor agreement,\r\nIceland is pulling out of a recession, which began in mid-1988 with a\r\nsharp decline in fish prices and an imposition of quotas on fish catches\r\nto conserve stocks. Inflation was down sharply from 20% in 1989\r\nto 8% in 1990.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $4.2 billion, per capita $16,300; real growth rate 0%\r\n(1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 7.8% (1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: 1.8% (1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $1.58 billion;

It presents both the\r\nentrepreneurial skills and drives of the capitalist system and\r\nwidespread government intervention of the socialist mold. Growth of 4%\r\nto 5% annually in the 1980s has softened the impact of population growth\r\non unemployment, social tranquility, and the environment. Agricultural\r\noutput has continued to expand, reflecting the greater use of modern\r\nfarming techniques and improved seed that have helped to make India\r\nself-sufficient in food grains and a net agricultural exporter. However,\r\ntens of millions of villagers, particularly in the south, have not\r\nbenefited from the green revolution and live in abject poverty. Industry\r\nhas benefited from a partial liberalization of controls. The growth rate\r\nof the service sector has also been strong. India, however, has been\r\nchallenged more recently by much lower foreign exchange reserves, higher\r\ninflation, and a large debt service burden.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GNP: $254 billion, per capita $300; real growth rate 4.5% (1990\r\nest.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 10.0% (1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: 20% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $34 billion;

Indonesia has extensive natural\r\nwealth yet, with a large and rapidly increasing population, it remains a\r\npoor country. GDP growth in 1985-89 averaged about 4%, somewhat short of\r\nthe more than 5% rate needed to absorb the 2.3 million workers annually\r\nentering the labor force. Agriculture, including forestry and fishing, is\r\nan important sector, accounting for 21% of GDP and over 50% of the labor\r\nforce. The staple crop is rice. Once the world's largest rice importer,\r\nIndonesia is now nearly self-sufficient. Plantation crops--rubber and\r\npalm oil--and textiles and plywood are being encouraged for both export\r\nand job generation. Industrial output now accounts for 30% of GDP\r\nbased on a supply of diverse natural resources, including crude oil,\r\nnatural gas, timber, metals, and coal. Of these, the oil sector dominates\r\nthe external economy, generating more than 20% of the government's\r\nrevenues and 40% of export earnings in 1989. However, the economy's\r\ngrowth is very dependent on the continuing expansion of nonoil exports.\r\nJapan is Indonesia's most important customer and supplier of aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $94 billion, per capita $490;

Disruptions from the bitter war with Iraq,\r\nmassive corruption, mismanagement, demographic pressures, and ideological\r\nrigidities have kept economic growth at depressed levels. Oil accounts\r\nfor over 90% of export revenues. A combination of war damage and low oil\r\nprices brought a 2% drop in GNP in 1988. GNP probably rose slightly in\r\n1989, considerably short of the 3.2% population growth rate in 1989.\r\nHeating oil and gasoline are rationed. Agriculture has suffered from the\r\nwar, land reform, and shortages of equipment and materials. The five-year\r\nplan seeks to reinvigorate the economy by increasing the role of the\r\nprivate sector, boosting nonoil income, and securing foreign loans. The\r\nplan is overly ambitious but probably will generate some short-term\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GNP: $80.0 billion, per capita $1,400; real growth rate 0.5%\r\n(1990 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 30-50% (1989 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: 30% (1989)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $63 billion;

The economy has been dominated by the oil sector,\r\nwhich has provided about 95% of foreign exchange earnings. In the 1980s\r\nfinancial problems, caused by massive expenditures in the eight-year\r\nwar with Iran and damage to oil export facilities by Iran, led the\r\ngovernment to implement austerity measures and to borrow heavily and\r\nlater reschedule foreign debt payments. After the end of hostilities in\r\n1988, oil exports gradually increased with the construction of new\r\npipelines and restoration of damaged facilities. Agricultural development\r\nremained hampered by labor shortages, salinization, and dislocations\r\ncaused by previous land reform and collectivization programs. The\r\nindustrial sector, although accorded high priority by the government,\r\nalso was under financial constraints. Iraq's seizure of Kuwait in August\r\n1990, subsequent international economic embargoes, and military actions\r\nby an international coalition beginning in January 1991 drastically\r\nchanged the economic picture. Oil exports were cut to near zero,\r\nand industrial and transportation facilities severely damaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GNP: $35 billion, per capita $1,940; real growth rate 5%\r\n(1989 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 30-40% (1989 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: less than 5% (1989 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $NA billion;

It depends on imports for crude oil, food, grains, raw\r\nmaterials, and military equipment. Despite limited natural resources,\r\nIsrael has developed its agricultural and industrial sectors on an\r\nintensive scale over the past 20 years. Industry accounts for about 23%\r\nof the labor force, agriculture for 5%, and services for most of the\r\nbalance. Diamonds, high-technology machinery, and agricultural products\r\n(fruits and vegetables) are the biggest export earners. The balance of\r\npayments has traditionally been negative, but is offset by large transfer\r\npayments and foreign loans. About half of Israel's $18 billion external\r\ngovernment debt is owed to the US, which is its major source for economic\r\nand military aid. To earn needed foreign exchange, Israel must continue\r\nto exploit high-technology niches in the international market, such as\r\nmedical scanning equipment. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on 2 August dealt\r\na blow to Israel's economy in 1990. Higher world oil prices added an\r\nestimated $300 million to Israel's 1990 oil import bill, and helped\r\nkeep the inflation rate at 18% for the year. Regional tensions\r\nand continuing acts of the Palestinian uprising\r\n(intifadah)-related violence contributed to a sharp dropoff in\r\ntourism--a key source of foreign exchange--to the lowest level since the\r\n1973 Arab-Israeli war. In 1991, the influx of up to 400,000 Soviet\r\nimmigrants will increase unemployment, intensify the country's\r\nhousing crisis, and contribute to a widening budget deficit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GNP: $46.5 billion, per capita $10,500;

The\r\neconomic recovery that began in mid-1983 has continued through 1990, with\r\nthe economy growing at an annual average rate of 3%. For the 1990s, Italy\r\nfaces the problems of refurbishing a tottering communications system,\r\ncurbing pollution in major industrial centers, and adjusting to the new\r\ncompetitive forces accompanying the ongoing economic integration of the\r\nEuropean Community.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $844.7 billion, per capita $14,600;

Consequently,\r\nthe economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices\r\nfor coffee and cocoa and to weather conditions. Despite attempts by the\r\ngovernment to diversify, the economy is still largely dependent on\r\nagriculture and related industries. The agricultural sector accounts for\r\nover one-third of GDP and about 80% of export earnings and employs about\r\n85% of the labor force. A collapse of world cocoa and coffee prices in\r\n1986 threw the economy into a recession, from which the country had not\r\nrecovered by 1990.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $10 billion, per capita $800; real growth rate - 2.9% (1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): -0.8% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: 14% (1985)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $2.8 billion (1989 est.);

In 1987 conditions\r\nbegan to improve for the bauxite and alumina industry because of\r\nincreases in world metal prices. The recovery has also been supported by\r\ngrowth in the manufacturing and tourism sectors. In September 1988,\r\nHurricane Gilbert inflicted severe damage on crops and the electric power\r\nsystem, a sharp but temporary setback to the economy. By October 1989 the\r\neconomic recovery from the hurricane was largely complete and real growth\r\nwas up about 3% for 1989.

Government-industry cooperation, a strong work ethic,\r\nand a comparatively small defense allocation have helped Japan advance\r\nrapidly, notably in high-technology fields. Industry, the most important\r\nsector of the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and\r\nfuels. Self-sufficent in rice, Japan must import 50% of its requirements\r\nfor other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one of the world's\r\nlargest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global\r\ncatch. Overall economic growth has been spectacular: a 10% average in the\r\n1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1990 strong investment and\r\nconsumption spending helped maintain growth at 5.6%. Inflation remains\r\nlow at 3.1% despite higher oil prices and rising wages because of a\r\ntight labor market. Japan continues to run a huge trade surplus, $52\r\nbillion in 1990, which supports extensive investment in foreign\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GNP: $2,115.2 billion, per capita $17,100; real growth rate 5.6%\r\n(1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 3.1% (1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: 2.1% (1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $499 billion;

Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and especially\r\nflowers are important export crops, shipped mostly to the UK. The Jersey\r\nbreed of dairy cattle is known worldwide and represents an important\r\nexport earner. Milk products go to the UK and other EC countries. In 1986\r\nthe finance sector overtook tourism as the main contributor to GDP,\r\naccounting for 40% of the island's output. In recent years the government\r\nhas encouraged light industry to locate in Jersey, with the result that\r\nan electronics industry has developed alongside the traditional\r\nmanufacturing of knitwear. All raw material and energy requirements are\r\nimported, as well as a large share of Jersey's food needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $NA, per capita $NA; real growth rate 8% (1987 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 8% (1988 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $308.0 million; expenditures $284.4 million,\r\nincluding capital expenditures of NA (1985)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Exports: $NA;\r\n\r\ncommodities--light industrial and electrical goods,\r\nfoodstuffs, textiles;\r\n\r\npartners--UK\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Imports: $NA;\r\n\r\ncommodities--machinery and transport equipment, manufactured goods,\r\nfoodstuffs, mineral fuels, chemicals;\r\n\r\npartners--UK\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_External debt: $NA\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Industrial production: growth rate NA%\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Electricity: 50,000 kW standby capacity (1990); power supplied by\r\nFrance\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Industries: tourism, banking and finance, dairy\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Agriculture: potatoes, cauliflowers, tomatoes; dairy and cattle\r\nfarming\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Economic aid: none\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Currency: Jersey pound (plural--pounds); 1 Jersey pound (5J) =\r\n100 pence\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Exchange rates: Jersey pounds (5J) per US$1--0.5171 (January\r\n1991), 0.5603 (1990), 0.6099 (1989), 0.5614 (1988), 0.6102 (1987), 0.6817\r\n(1986), 0.7714 (1985); the Jersey pound is at par with the British pound\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Fiscal year: 1 April-31 March\r\n\r\n\r\n_*_Communications\r\n_#_Ports: Saint Helier, Gorey, Saint Aubin\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Airports: 1 with permanent-surface runway 1,220-2,439 m (Saint\r\nPeter)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Telecommunications: 63,700 telephones; stations--1 AM, no FM, 1\r\nTV; 3 submarine cables\r\n\r\n\r\n_*_Defense Forces\r\n_#_Note: defense is the responsibility of the UK\r\n_%_\r\n_@_Johnston Atoll\r\n(territory of the US)\r\n_*_Geography\r\n_#_Total area: 2.8 km2; land area: 2.8 km2\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Comparative area: about 4.7 times the size of The Mall in\r\nWashington, DC\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Land boundaries: none\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Coastline: 10 km\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Maritime claims:\r\n\r\nContiguous zone: 12 nm;\r\n\r\nContinental shelf: 200 m (depth);\r\n\r\nExclusive economic zone: 200 nm;\r\n\r\nTerritorial sea: 12 nm\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Climate: tropical, but generally dry; consistent northeast trade\r\nwinds with little seasonal temperature variation\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Terrain: mostly flat with a maximum elevation of 4 meters\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Natural resources: guano (deposits worked until about 1890)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Land use: arable land 0%; permanent crops 0%; meadows and pastures\r\n0%; forest and woodland 0%; other 100%\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Environment: some low-growing vegetation\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Note: strategic location 1,328 km west-southwest of Honolulu in\r\nthe North Pacific Ocean, about one-third of the way between Hawaii and\r\nthe Marshall Islands; Johnston Island and Sand Island are natural\r\nislands; North Island (Akau) and East Island (Hikina) are manmade islands\r\nformed from coral dredging; closed to the public; former nuclear weapons\r\ntest site; site of Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System\r\n(JACADS)\r\n\r\n\r\n_*_People\r\n_#_Population: 1,325 (December 1990); all US government personnel and\r\ncontractors\r\n\r\n\r\n_*_Government\r\n_#_Long-form name: none (territory of the US)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Type: unincorporated territory of the US administered by the US\r\nDefense Nuclear Agency (DNA) and managed cooperatively by DNA and the\r\nFish and Wildlife Service of the US Department of the Interior as part of\r\nthe National Wildlife Refuge system\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Diplomatic representation: none (territory of the US)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Flag: the flag of the US is used\r\n\r\n\r\n_*_Economy\r\n_#_Overview: Economic activity is limited to providing services to\r\nUS military personnel and contractors located on the island.

Recent years, however, have witnessed a sharp reduction in grant\r\naid from Arab oil-producing countries and a dropoff in worker\r\nremittances, with national growth averaging 1-2%. Imports--mainly oil,\r\ncapital goods, consumer durables, and foodstuffs--have been outstripping\r\nexports by roughly $2 billion annually, the difference being made up by\r\naid, remittances, and borrowing. In mid-1989, the Jordanian Government\r\nagreed to implement an IMF austerity program designed to tackle the\r\ncountry's serious economic problems. The program sought to gradually\r\nreduce the government's budget deficit over the next several years and\r\nimplement badly needed structural reforms in the economy. In return for\r\nagreeing to the IMF program, Jordan was granted IMF standby loans of over\r\n$100 million. Recognizing that it would be unable to cover its debt\r\nobligations, the government also began debt rescheduling negotiations\r\nwith creditors in mid-1989. The onset of the Gulf crisis in August 1990\r\nforced the government to shelve the IMF program and suspend most debt\r\npayments and rescheduling negotiations. Economic prospects for 1991\r\nare especially gloomy, given the unsettled conditions in the Middle\r\nEast.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GNP: $4.6 billion, per capita $1,400; real growth rate - 15%\r\n(1990 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 15% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: 30% (January 1991 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $1.05 billion;

Commercially\r\nviable phosphate deposits were exhausted at the time of independence\r\nin 1979. Copra and fish now represent the bulk of production and exports.\r\nThe economy has fluctuated widely in recent years. Real GDP declined\r\nabout 8% in 1987, as the fish catch fell sharply to only one-fourth the\r\nlevel of 1986 and copra production was hampered by repeated rains. Output\r\nrebounded strongly in 1988, with real GDP growing by 17%. The upturn in\r\neconomic growth came from an increase in copra production and a good fish\r\ncatch. Following the strong surge in output in 1988, GNP increased 1%\r\nin 1989 and again in 1990.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $36.8 million, per capita $525; real growth rate 1.0% (1990\r\nest.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 4.0% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: 2% (1985);

and state-owned industry produces 95%\r\nof manufactured goods. State control of economic affairs is unusually\r\ntight even for a Communist country because of the small size and\r\nhomogeneity of the society and the strict one-man rule of Kim. Economic\r\ngrowth during the period 1984-90 averaged approximately 3%. Abundant\r\nnatural resources and hydropower form the basis of industrial\r\ndevelopment. Output of the extractive industries includes coal, iron ore,\r\nmagnesite, graphite, copper, zinc, lead, and precious metals.\r\nManufacturing emphasis is centered on heavy industry, with light industry\r\nlagging far behind. Despite the use of high-yielding seed varieties,\r\nexpansion of irrigation, and the heavy use of fertilizers, North Korea\r\nhas not yet become self-sufficient in food production. Four consecutive\r\nyears of poor harvests, coupled with distribution problems, have led to\r\nchronic food shortages. North Korea remains far behind South Korea in\r\neconomic development and living standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GNP: $29.7 billion, per capita $1,390; real growth rate 2%\r\n(1990 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: officially none\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $15.6 billion;

Real GNP--which grew by 6.7% in 1989\r\nafter an average annual growth of over 12% between 1986-88--grew about\r\n9% in 1990. Labor unrest--which led to substantial wage hikes in\r\n1987-88--was noticeably calmer in 1990, unemployment averaged a low\r\n2.5%, and investment was strong. Inflation rates, however, are beginning\r\nto challenge South Korea's strong economic performance. Consumer prices\r\nrose 8.6%, the highest rate in nine years.

Kuwait has the third-largest\r\noil reserves in the world after Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Earnings from\r\nhydrocarbons generated over 90% of both export and government revenues\r\nand contributed about 40% to GDP. Most of the nonoil sector has\r\ntraditionally been dependent upon oil-derived government revenues.\r\nIraq's destruction of Kuwait's oil industry during the Gulf war\r\nhas devastated the economy. Iraq destroyed or damaged more than 80%\r\nof Kuwait's 950 operating oil wells, as well as sabotaging key surface\r\nfacilities. Western firefighters had brought about 140 of the 600\r\noil well fires and blowouts under control as of early June 1991.\r\nIt could take two to three years to restore Kuwait's oil production to\r\nits prewar level of about 2.0 million barrels per day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $19.8 billion, per capita $9,700;

The cease-fire established in October\r\n1976 between the domestic political groups generally held for about six\r\nyears, despite occasional fighting. Syrian troops constituted as the Arab\r\nDeterrent Force by the Arab League have remained in Lebanon. Syria's\r\nmove toward supporting the Lebanese Muslims and the Palestinians and\r\nIsrael's growing support for Lebanese Christians brought the two sides\r\ninto rough equilibrium, but no progress was made toward national\r\nreconciliation or political reforms--the original cause of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Continuing Israeli concern about the Palestinian presence in\r\nLebanon led to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June 1982. Israeli\r\nforces occupied all of the southern portion of the country and mounted a\r\nsummer-long siege of Beirut, which resulted in the evacuation of the\r\nPLO from Beirut in September under the supervision of a multinational\r\nforce (MNF) made up of US, French, and Italian troops.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Within days of the departure of the MNF, Lebanon's newly elected\r\npresident, Bashir Gemayel, was assassinated. In the wake of his death,\r\nChristian militiamen massacred hundreds of Palestinian refugees in two\r\nBeirut camps. This prompted the return of the MNF to ease the security\r\nburden on Lebanon's weak Army and security forces. In late March 1984\r\nthe last MNF units withdrew.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Lebanese Parliamentarians met in Taif, Saudi Arabia in late 1989\r\nand concluded a national reconciliation pact that codified a new\r\npower-sharing formula, specifiying a Christian president but giving\r\nMuslims more authority. Rene Muawad was subsequently elected president on\r\n4 November 1989, ending a 13-month period during which Lebanon had no\r\npresident and rival Muslim and Christian governments. Muawad was\r\nassassinated 17 days later, on 22 November; on 24 November Ilyas Harawi\r\nwas elected to succeed Muawad.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In October 1990, the chances for ending the 16 year old civil war\r\nand implementing Ta'if were markedly improved when Syrian and Lebanese\r\nforces ousted renegade Christian General Awn from his stronghold in East\r\nBeirut. Awn had defied the legitimate government and established a\r\nseparate mini-state within East Beirut after being appointed acting\r\nPrime Minister by outgoing President Gemayel in 1988. Awn and his\r\nsupporters feared Ta'if would diminish Christian power in Lebanon\r\nand increase the influence of Syria.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Since the removal of Awn, the Lebanese Government has reunited the\r\ncapital city and implemented a phased plan to disarm the militias\r\nand gradually reestablish authority throughout Lebanon. The army has\r\ndeployed from Beirut north along the coast road to Tripoli, southeast\r\ninto the Shuf mountains, and south to the vicinity of Sidon. Many\r\nmilitiamen from Christian and Muslim groups have evacuated Beirut\r\nfor their strongholds in the north, south, and east of the country.\r\nSome heavy weapons possessed by the militias have been turned over to\r\nthe government, which has begun a plan to integrate some militiamen\r\ninto the military and the internal security forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Lebanon and Syria signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation in\r\nMay 1991. Lebanon continues to be partially occupied by Syrian troops,\r\nwhich are deployed in East and West Beirut, its southern suburbs,\r\nthe Bekaa Valley, and throughout northern Lebanon.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Iran also maintains a small contingent of revolutionary guards\r\nin the Bekaa Valley and South Lebanon to support Lebanese Islamic\r\nfundamentalist groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Israel withdrew the bulk of its forces from the south in 1985,\r\nalthough it still retains troops in a 10-km-deep security zone north\r\nof its border with Lebanon. Israel arms and trains the Army of South\r\nLebanon (ASL), which also occupies the security zone and is Israel's\r\nfirst line of defense against attacks on its northern border.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following description is based on the present constitutional\r\nand customary practices of the Lebanese system.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Long-form name: Republic of Lebanon; note--may be changed to\r\nLebanese Republic\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Type: republic\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Capital: Beirut\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Administrative divisions: 5 governorates (muhafazat,\r\nsingular--muhafazah); Al Biqa, Al Janub, Ash Shamal,\r\nBayrut, Jabal Lubnan\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Independence: 22 November 1943 (from League of Nations mandate\r\nunder French administration)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Constitution: 26 May 1926 (amended)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Legal system: mixture of Ottoman law, canon law, Napoleonic code,\r\nand civil law; no judicial review of legislative acts; has not accepted\r\ncompulsory ICJ jurisdiction\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_National holiday: Independence Day, 22 November (1943)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Executive branch: president, prime minister, Cabinet; note--by\r\ncustom, the president is a Maronite Christian, the prime minister is a\r\nSunni Muslim, and the speaker of the legislature is a Shia Muslim\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Legislative branch: unicameral National Assembly (Arabic--Majlis\r\nAlnuwab, French--Assemblee Nationale)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Judicial branch: four Courts of Cassation (three courts for civil\r\nand commercial cases and one court for criminal cases)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Leaders:\r\n\r\nChief of State--Ilyas HARAWI (since 24 November 1989);\r\n\r\nHead of Government--Prime Minister Umar KARAMI (since 20\r\nDecember 1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Political parties and leaders: political party activity is\r\norganized along largely sectarian lines; numerous political groupings\r\nexist, consisting of individual political figures and followers\r\nmotivated by religious, clan, and economic considerations; most parties\r\nhave well-armed militias, which are still involved in occasional clashes\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Suffrage: compulsory for all males at age 21; authorized for women\r\nat age 21 with elementary education\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Elections:\r\n\r\nNational Assembly--elections should be held every four years\r\nbut security conditions have prevented elections since May 1972\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Communists: the Lebanese Communist Party was legalized in 1970;\r\nmembers and sympathizers estimated at 2,000-3,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Member of: ABEDA, ACCT, AFESD, AL, AMF, CCC, ESCWA, FAO, G-24,\r\nG-77, IAEA, IBRD, ICAO, ICC, ICFTU, IDA, IDB, IFAD, IFC, ILO, IMF, IMO,\r\nINTELSAT, INTERPOL, IOC, ITU, LORCS, NAM, OIC, PCA, UN, UNCTAD,\r\nUNESCO, UNHCR, UNIDO, UNRWA, UPU, WFTU, WHO, WIPO, WMO, WTO\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Diplomatic representation: Ambassador Nassib S.

The battered\r\neconomy has also been propped up by a financially sound banking system\r\nand resilient small- and medium-scale manufacturers. Family remittances,\r\nforeign financial support to political factions, the narcotics trade, and\r\ninternational emergency aid are main sources of foreign exchange.\r\nEconomic prospects for 1991 have brightened, particularly if the\r\nSyrian-backed government is able to maintain law and order and\r\nreestablish business confidence. Rebuilding war-ravaged Beirut is likely\r\nto provide a major stimulus to the Lebanese economy in 1991.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $3.3 billion, per capita $1,000; real growth rate - 15%\r\n(1990 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 100% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: 35% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $120 million;

Its economy is based on\r\nagriculture, light manufacturing, and remittances from laborers employed\r\nin South Africa ($153 million in 1989). The great majority of households\r\ngain their livelihoods from subsistence farming and migrant labor.\r\nManufacturing depends largely on farm products to support the milling,\r\ncanning, leather, and jute industries; other industries include textile,\r\nclothing, and light engineering. Industry's share of GDP rose from\r\n6% in 1982 to 15% in 1989. Political and economic instability in South\r\nAfrica raise uncertainties for Lesotho's economy, especially with respect\r\nto migrant worker remittances--over one-third of GDP.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $420 million, per capita $240;

Since 1980, however, the sharp\r\ndrop in oil prices and the resulting decline in export revenues have\r\nadversely affected economic development. In 1988 per capita GNP was the\r\nhighest in Africa at $5,410, but it had been $2,000 higher in 1982.\r\nSevere cutbacks in imports over the past five years have led to shortages\r\nof basic goods and foodstuffs, although the reopening of the\r\nLibyan-Tunisian border in April 1988 and the Libyan-Egyptian border in\r\nDecember 1989 have somewhat eased shortages. Austerity budgets and a lack\r\nof trained technicians have undermined the government's ability to\r\nimplement a number of planned infrastructure development projects.\r\nWindfall profits from the hike in world oil prices in late 1990 improved\r\nthe foreign payments position and may permit Tripoli to ease austerity\r\nmeasures. The nonoil industrial and construction sectors, which account\r\nfor about 22% of GDP, have expanded from processing mostly agricultural\r\nproducts to include petrochemicals, iron, steel, and aluminum. Although\r\nagriculture accounts for less than 5% of GNP, it employs 18% of the labor\r\nforce. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit farm output,\r\nrequiring Libya to import about 75% of its food requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GNP: $24 billion, per capita $5,860; real growth rate 3% (1989\r\nest.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 20% (1988 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: 2% (1988 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $8.1 billion;

Industry accounts for 54% of total\r\nemployment, the service sector 42% (mostly based on tourism), and\r\nagriculture and forestry 4%. The sale of postage stamps to collectors is\r\nestimated at $10 million annually. Low business taxes (the maximum tax\r\nrate is 20%) and easy incorporation rules have induced about 25,000\r\nholding or so-called letter box companies to establish nominal offices in\r\nLiechtenstein. Such companies, incorporated solely for tax purposes,\r\nprovide 30% of state revenues. The economy is tied closely to that of\r\nSwitzerland in a customs union, and incomes and living standards parallel\r\nthose of the more prosperous Swiss groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $630 million, per capita $22,300;

The economy is\r\npredominately agricultural and operates under a relatively free\r\nenterprise environment, with about 90% of the population living in\r\nrural areas. Agriculture accounts for 40% of GDP and 90% of export\r\nrevenues. After two years of weak performance, economic growth improved\r\nsignificantly in 1988-90 as a result of good weather and a broadly based\r\neconomic adjustment effort by the government. The economy depends on\r\nsubstantial inflows of economic assistance from the IMF, the World Bank,\r\nand individual donor nations. The closure of traditional trade routes\r\nthrough Mozambique continues to be a constraint on the economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $1.6 billion, per capita $175; growth rate 4.8% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 11.7% (1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $398 million;

Real output grew by 8.8% in\r\n1989 and 10% in 1990, helped by vigorous growth in manufacturing\r\noutput, further increases in foreign direct investment, particularly\r\nfrom Japanese and Taiwanese firms facing higher costs at home, and\r\nincreased oil production in 1990. Malaysia has become the world's\r\nthird-largest producer of semiconductor devices (after the US and Japan)\r\nand the world's largest exporter of semiconductor devices. Inflation\r\nremained low as unemployment stood at 6% of the labor force and as\r\nthe government followed prudent fiscal/monetary policies. The country is\r\nnot self-sufficient in food, and some of the rural population subsists at\r\nthe poverty level. Malaysia's high export dependence leaves it\r\nvulnerable to a recession in the OECD countries or a fall in world\r\ncommodity prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $43.1 billion, per capita $2,460; real growth rate 10%\r\n(1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 3.1% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: 6% (1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $12.6 billion;

The government's policy of offering incentives to\r\nhigh-technology companies and financial institutions to locate on the\r\nisland has paid off in expanding employment opportunities in high-income\r\nindustries. As a result, agriculture and fishing, once the mainstays of\r\nthe economy, have declined in their shares of GNP. Banking now\r\ncontributes over 20% to GNP and manufacturing about 15%.

The tourist industry is the primary source of foreign exchange and\r\nemploys about 10% of the labor force. The islands have few natural\r\nresources, and imports far exceed exports.

Agriculture accounts for about 12% of GDP and the small\r\nindustrial sector for 10%. Sugar production has declined, with most of\r\nthe sugarcane now used for the production of rum. Banana exports are\r\nincreasing, going mostly to France. The bulk of meat, vegetable, and\r\ngrain requirements must be imported, contributing to a chronic trade\r\ndeficit that requires large annual transfers of aid from France. Tourism\r\nhas become more important than agricultural exports as a source of\r\nforeign exchange. The majority of the work force is employed in the\r\nservice sector and in administration. In 1986 per capita GDP was\r\nrelatively high at $6,000.

Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore that\r\naccount for almost 50% of total exports. The decline in world demand for\r\nthis ore, however, has led to cutbacks in production. The nation's\r\ncoastal waters are among the richest fishing areas in the world, but\r\noverexploitation by foreigners threatens this key source of revenue. The\r\ncountry's first deepwater port opened near Nouakchott in 1986. In recent\r\nyears, the droughts, the conflict with Senegal, rising energy costs,\r\nand economic mismanagement have resulted in a substantial buildup of\r\nforeign debt. The government now has begun the second stage of an\r\neconomic reform program in consultation with the World Bank, the IMF,\r\nand major donor countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $942 million, per capita $500;

In the 1980s Mexico experienced\r\nsevere economic difficulties: the nation accumulated large external debts\r\nas world petroleum prices fell; rapid population growth outstripped the\r\ndomestic food supply; and inflation, unemployment, and pressures to\r\nemigrate became more acute. Growth in national output, however,\r\nappears to be recovering, rising from 1.4% in 1988 to 3.9% in 1990.\r\nThe US is Mexico's major trading partner, accounting for two-thirds of\r\nits exports and imports. After petroleum, border assembly plants and\r\ntourism are the largest earners of foreign exchange. The government, in\r\nconsultation with international economic agencies, is implementing\r\nprograms to stabilize the economy and foster growth. In 1991 the\r\ngovernment also plans to begin negotiations with the US and Canada on a\r\nfree trade agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $236 billion, per capita $2,680; real growth rate 3.9%\r\n(1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 30% (1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: 15-18% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $44.3 billion;

In recent years extensive\r\nmineral resources have been developed with Soviet support. The mining and\r\nprocessing of coal, copper, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and gold\r\naccount for a large part of industrial production. In early 1991 the\r\nMongolian leadership was struggling with severe economic dislocations,\r\nmainly attributable to chaotic economic conditions in the USSR, by\r\nfar Mongolia's leading trade and development partner. For example,\r\nthe government doubled most prices in January 1991, and industrial\r\nproduction dropped 10% in the first quarter of 1991. Moscow almost\r\ncertainly will be cutting aid in 1991.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $2.2 billion, per capita $1,000 (1990 est.); real\r\ngrowth rate NA%\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: 10% (February 1991)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: deficit of $240 million (1991 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Exports: $784 million (f.o.b., 1988);\r\n\r\ncommodities--livestock, animal products, wool, hides, fluorspar,\r\nnonferrous metals, minerals;\r\n\r\npartners--nearly all trade with Communist countries (about 80%\r\nwith USSR)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Imports: $1.14 billion (f.o.b., 1988);\r\n\r\ncommodities--machinery and equipment, fuels, food products,\r\nindustrial consumer goods, chemicals, building materials, sugar, tea;\r\n\r\npartners--nearly all trade with Communist countries (about 80% with\r\nUSSR)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_External debt: $16.8 billion (yearend 1990);

Mining accounts for almost\r\n30% of GDP. Namibia is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals in\r\nAfrica and the world's fifth-largest producer of uranium. Alluvial\r\ndiamond deposits are among the richest in the world, making Namibia a\r\nprimary source for gem-quality diamonds. Namibia also produces large\r\nquantities of lead, zinc, tin, silver, and tungsten, and it has\r\nsubstantial resources of coal. More than half the population depends\r\non agriculture (largely subsistence agriculture) for its livelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GNP: $1.8 billion, per capita $1,240; real growth rate - 2.0%\r\n(1990 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 15.1% (1989)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: over 30% (1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $794.1 million;

Few other resources exist so\r\nmost necessities must be imported, including fresh water from\r\nAustralia. The rehabilitation of mined land and the replacement of income\r\nfrom phosphates constitute serious long-term problems.

Real growth\r\naveraged 4% in the 1980s until FY89, when it plunged to 1.5% because of\r\na trade/transit dispute with India. Though the impasse is over,\r\npolitical turmoil and inflated energy costs will probably constrain\r\ngrowth to under 4%. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy,\r\nproviding a livelihood for over 90% of the population and\r\naccounting for 60% of GDP. Industrial activity is limited, mainly\r\ninvolving the processing of agricultural produce (jute, sugarcane,\r\ntobacco, and grain). Production of textiles and carpets has expanded\r\nrecently and accounted for 87% of foreign exchange earnings in FY89.\r\nApart from agricultural land and forests, the only other exploitable\r\nnatural resources are mica, hydropower, and tourism. Agricultural\r\nproduction in the late 1980s grew by about 5%, compared\r\nwith a population growth of 2.6%. Forty percent or more of the\r\npopulation is undernourished partly because of poor distribution.\r\nEconomic prospects for the 1990s are poor, with economic growth\r\nprobably outpacing population growth only slightly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $3.0 billion, per capita $160;

The government\r\nhas hoped that dynamic growth would boost real incomes, reduce\r\ninflationary pressures, and permit the expansion of welfare benefits. The\r\nresults have been mixed: inflation is down from double-digit levels\r\nbut growth has been sluggish and unemployment, always a highly sensitive\r\nissue, has been at a record high 7.4%.

Over 50% of the agricultural and industrial\r\nfirms are state owned. Sandinista economic policies and the war\r\nhave produced a severe economic crisis. The foundation of the economy\r\ncontinues to be the export of agricultural commodities, largely coffee\r\nand cotton. Farm production fell by roughly 7% in 1989, the fifth\r\nsuccessive year of decline. The agricultural sector employs 44%\r\nof the work force and accounts for 23% of GDP and 86% of export earnings.\r\nIndustry, which employs 13% of the work force and contributes about\r\n25% to GDP, showed a drop of 7% in 1989 and remains below\r\npre-1979 levels.

In 1990, despite\r\nrising oil prices and a sharp drop in inflation, performance remained\r\nslack with continuing underutilization of industrial capacity and a\r\nsecond year of relatively weak agricultural performance. Agricultural\r\nproduction was up only 4.2% in 1990, still below the 1987 level.\r\nIndustrial output showed a 7.2% increase, but remained below the 1985\r\nlevel. Government efforts to reduce Nigeria's dependence on oil exports\r\nand to sustain noninflationary growth have fallen short due to inadequate\r\nnew investment funds. Living standards continue to deteriorate from the\r\nhigher level of the early 1980s oil boom.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $27.2 billion, per capita $230; real growth rate 2.7%\r\n(1990 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 16% (1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $8.0 billion;

The agricultural sector consists mainly of\r\nsubsistence gardening, although some cash crops are grown for export.\r\nIndustry consists primarily of small factories to process passion fruit,\r\nlime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The sale of postage stamps to foreign\r\ncollectors is an important source of revenue. The island in recent years\r\nhas suffered a serious loss of population because of migration of Niueans\r\nto New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GNP: $2.1 million, per capita $1,000; real growth rate NA%\r\n(1989 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 9.6% (1984)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $5.5 million;

covers about one-third of the global surface; larger than\r\nthe total land area of the world\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Coastline: 135,663 km\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Climate: the western Pacific is monsoonal--a rainy season occurs\r\nduring the summer months, when moisture-laden winds blow from the ocean\r\nover the land, and a dry season during the winter months, when dry winds\r\nblow from the Asian land mass back to the ocean\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Terrain: surface in the northern Pacific dominated by a clockwise,\r\nwarm water gyre (broad, circular system of currents) and in the southern\r\nPacific by a counterclockwise, cool water gyre; sea ice occurs in the\r\nBering Sea and\r\nSea of Okhotsk during winter and reaches maximum northern extent from\r\nAntarctica in October; the ocean floor in the eastern Pacific is\r\ndominated by the East Pacific Rise, while the western Pacific is\r\ndissected by deep trenches; the world's greatest depth is 10,924 meters\r\nin the Marianas Trench\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Natural resources: oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand\r\nand gravel aggregates, placer deposits, fish\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Environment: endangered marine species include the dugong, sea\r\nlion, sea otter, seals, turtles, and whales; oil pollution in Philippine\r\nSea and South China Sea; dotted with low coral islands and rugged\r\nvolcanic islands in the southwestern Pacific Ocean; subject to tropical\r\ncyclones (typhoons) in southeast and east Asia from May to December (most\r\nfrequent from July to October); tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form\r\nsouth of Mexico and strike Central America and Mexico from June to\r\nOctober (most common in August and September); southern shipping lanes\r\nsubject to icebergs from Antarctica; occasional El Nino phenomenon\r\noccurs off the coast of Peru when the trade winds slacken and the warm\r\nEquatorial Countercurrent moves south, which kills the plankton that is\r\nthe primary food source for anchovies; consequently, the anchovies move\r\nto better feeding grounds, causing resident marine birds to starve by the\r\nthousands because of their lost food source\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Note: the major choke points are the Bering Strait, Panama\r\nCanal, Luzon Strait, and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides the\r\nPacific Ocean into the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean;\r\nships subject to superstructure icing in extreme north from October to\r\nMay and in extreme south from May to October; persistent fog in the\r\nnorthern Pacific from June to December is a hazard to shipping;\r\nsurrounded by a zone of violent volcanic and earthquake activity\r\nsometimes referred to as the Pacific Ring of Fire\r\n\r\n\r\n_*_Economy\r\n_#_Overview: The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world\r\neconomy and particularly to those nations its waters directly touch.\r\nIt provides cheap sea transportation between East and West, extensive\r\nfishing grounds, offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and sand and\r\ngravel for the construction industry. In 1985 over half (54%) of the\r\nworld's total fish catch came from the Pacific Ocean, which is the only\r\nocean where the fish catch has increased every year since 1978.\r\nExploitation of offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an\r\never-increasing role in the energy supplies of Australia, New Zealand,\r\nChina, US, and Peru. The high cost of recovering offshore oil and gas,\r\ncombined with the wide swings in world prices for oil since 1985, has\r\nslowed but not stopped new drillings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Industries: fishing, oil and gas production\r\n\r\n\r\n_*_Communications\r\n_#_Ports: Bangkok (Thailand), Hong Kong, Los Angeles (US),\r\nManila (Philippines), Pusan (South Korea), San Francisco (US), Seattle\r\n(US), Shanghai (China), Singapore, Sydney (Australia), Vladivostok\r\n(USSR), Wellington (NZ), Yokohama (Japan)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Telecommunications: several submarine cables with network focused\r\non Guam and Hawaii\r\n_%_\r\n_@_Pakistan\r\n_*_Geography\r\n_#_Total area: 803,940 km2;

In addition, the economy\r\nmust support a large military establishment and provide for the needs of\r\n4 million Afghan refugees. A real economic growth rate averaging 5-6% in\r\nrecent years has enabled the country to cope with these problems. Almost\r\nall agriculture and small-scale industry is in private hands, and the\r\ngovernment seeks to privatize a portion of the large-scale industrial\r\nenterprises now publicly owned. In December 1988, Pakistan signed a\r\nthree-year economic reform agreement with the IMF, which provides for a\r\nreduction in the government deficit and a liberalization of trade in\r\nreturn for further IMF financial support. Late in 1990, the IMF\r\nsuspended assistance to Pakistan because the government failed to\r\nfollow through on deficit reforms. Pakistan almost certainly will make\r\nlittle headway on raising living standards for its rapidly expanding\r\npopulation; at the current rate of growth, population would double in\r\n29 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GNP: $43.3 billion, per capita $380;

Agriculture,\r\nincluding forestry, accounts for about 25% of GNP, employs about 45% of\r\nthe labor force, and provides the bulk of exports. Paraguay has no known\r\nsignificant mineral or petroleum resources but does have a large\r\nhydropower potential. Since 1981 economic performance has declined\r\ncompared with the boom period of 1976-81, when real GDP grew at an\r\naverage annual rate of nearly 11%.  During 1982-86 real GDP fell in three\r\nof five years, inflation jumped to an annual rate of 32%, and\r\nforeign debt rose. Factors responsible for the erratic behavior of the\r\neconomy were the completion of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam, bad weather\r\nfor crops, and weak international commodity prices for agricultural\r\nexports. In 1987 the economy experienced a minor recovery because of\r\nimproved weather conditions and stronger international prices for key\r\nagricultural exports.

In the 1980s the economy suffered from hyperinflation,\r\ndeclining per capita output, and mounting external debt. Peru was shut\r\noff from IMF and World Bank support in the mid-1980s because of its\r\nhuge debt arrears. An austerity program implemented shortly after the\r\nFujimori government took office in July 1990 contributed to a third\r\nconsecutive yearly contraction of economic activity, but was able to\r\ngenerate a small recovery in the last quarter. After a burst of\r\ninflation as the program eliminated government price subsidies, monthly\r\nprice increases eased to the single-digit level for the first time\r\nsince mid-1988. Lima has restarted current payments to multilateral\r\nlenders and, although it faces $14 billion in arrears on its external\r\ndebt, is working toward an accommodation with its creditors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $19.3 billion, per capita $898;

About 75% of agricultural production had come from the\r\nprivate sector and the rest from state farms. The economy has presented a\r\npicture of moderate but slowing growth against a background of underlying\r\nweaknesses in technology and worker motivation. GNP dropped by 2.0% in\r\n1989 and by a further 8.9% in 1990. The inflation rate, after falling\r\nsharply from the 1982 peak of 100% to 22% in 1986, rose to a galloping\r\nrate of 640% in 1989 and dropped back to 250% in 1990. Shortages of\r\nconsumer goods and some food items worsened in 1988-89. Agricultural\r\nproducts and coal are among the biggest hard currency earners, but\r\nmanufactures are increasing in importance. Poland, with its hard currency\r\ndebt of $48.5 billion, is severely limited in its ability to import\r\nmuch-needed hard currency goods. The sweeping political changes of 1989\r\ndisrupted normal economic channels and exacerbated shortages. In January\r\n1990, the new Solidarity-led government adopted a cold turkey program for\r\ntransforming Poland to a market economy. The government moved to\r\neliminate subsidies, free prices, make the zloty convertible, and,\r\nin general, halt the hyperinflation. These financial measures were\r\naccompanied by plans to privatize the economy in stages. While inflation\r\nfell to an annual rate of 77.5% by November of 1990, the rise in\r\nunemployment and the drop in living standards have led to growing popular\r\ndiscontent and to a change of government in January 1991. The new\r\ngovernment is continuing the previous government's economic\r\nprogram, while trying to speed privatization and to better cushion the\r\npopulace from the dislocations associated with reform. Substantial\r\noutside aid will be needed if Poland is to make a successful transition\r\nin the 1990s.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GNP: $158.5 billion, per capita $4,200; real growth rate - 8.9%\r\n(1990 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 250% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: 6.1% (end-December 1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $20.9 billion;

Industry has surpassed agriculture as the primary\r\nsector of economic activity and income. Encouraged by duty-free\r\naccess to the US and by tax incentives, US firms have invested heavily\r\nin Puerto Rico since the 1950s. Important new industries include\r\npharmaceuticals, electronics, textiles, petrochemicals, and processed\r\nfoods. Sugar production has lost out to dairy production and other\r\nlivestock products as the main source of income in the agricultural\r\nsector. Tourism has traditionally been an important source of income\r\nfor the island. The economy is slowly recovering from the disruptions\r\ncaused by Hurricane Hugo in September 1989. The tourism infrastructure\r\nwas especially hard hit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GNP: $20.1 billion, per capita $6,100; real growth rate 3.6% (FY89)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 6.3% (October 1989-90)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: 14.9% (October 1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $5.5 billion;

The year 1990 witnessed about a 20%\r\ndrop in industrial production because of energy and input shortages and\r\nlabor unrest. In recent years the agricultural sector has had to contend\r\nwith drought, mismanagement, and shortages of inputs. A drought in 1990\r\ncontributed to a lackluster harvest, a problem compounded by corruption\r\nand a poor distribution system. The new government is slowly loosening\r\nthe tight central controls of Ceausescu's command economy. It has\r\ninstituted moderate land reforms, with close to one-half of cropland now\r\nin private hands, and it has allowed changes in prices for private\r\nagricultural output. Also, the new regime is permitting the\r\nestablishment of private enterprises, largely in services, handicrafts,\r\nand small-scale industry. New laws providing for the privatization\r\nof large state firms have been passed. However, most of the early\r\nprivatization will involve converting state firms into joint-stock\r\ncompanies. The selling of shares to the public has not yet been worked\r\nout. Furthermore, the government has halted the old policy of diverting\r\nfood from domestic consumption to hard currency export markets. So far,\r\nthe government does not seem willing to adopt a thoroughgoing market\r\nsystem, that is, there is great caution in decontrolling prices because\r\nof public opposition. The government has sharply raised price ceilings\r\ninstead of lifting them entirely.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GNP: $69.9 billion, per capita $3,000; real growth rate - 10.8%\r\n(1990 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 50% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget:  revenues $28.4 billion;

The amount of fertile\r\nland is limited, however, and deforestation and soil erosion have created\r\nproblems. The industrial sector in Rwanda is small, contributing only\r\n16% to GDP. Manufacturing focuses mainly on the processing of\r\nagricultural products. The Rwandan economy remains dependent on coffee\r\nexports and foreign aid, with no relief in sight. Weak international\r\nprices since 1986 have caused the economy to contract and per capita\r\nGDP to decline. A structural adjustment program with the World Bank\r\nbegan in October 1990. An outbreak of insurgency, also in October, has\r\ndampened any prospects for economic improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $2.2 billion, per capita $300; real growth rate - 2.2% (1989\r\nest.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 1% (1989)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $391 million;

The economy has been declining, however, because\r\nthe number of ships stopping at Saint Pierre has dropped steadily over\r\nthe years. In March 1989, an agreement between France and Canada set fish\r\nquotas for Saint Pierre's trawlers fishing in Canadian and\r\nCanadian-claimed waters for three years.

Since then, however,\r\ncocoa production has gradually deteriorated because of drought and\r\nmismanagement, so that by 1987 output had fallen to less than 50% of\r\nits former levels. As a result, a shortage of cocoa for export has\r\ncreated a serious balance-of-payments problem. Production of less\r\nimportant crops, such as coffee, copra, and palm kernels, has\r\nalso declined. The value of imports generally exceeds that of\r\nexports by a ratio of 4 to 1. The emphasis on cocoa production at\r\nthe expense of other food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import\r\n90% of food needs. It also has to import all fuels and most manufactured\r\ngoods. Over the years, Sao Tome has been unable to service its external\r\ndebt, which amounts to roughly 80% of export earnings. Considerable\r\npotential exists for development of a tourist industry, and the\r\ngovernment has taken steps to expand facilities in recent years. The\r\ngovernment also implemented a Five-Year Plan covering 1986-90 to\r\nrestructure the economy and reschedule external debt service payments in\r\ncooperation with the International Development Association and Western\r\nlenders.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $46.0 million, per capita $380;

Subsistence agriculture dominates the economy, generating\r\nabout one-third of GDP and employing about two-thirds of the working\r\npopulation. Manufacturing accounts for less than 10% of GDP, consisting\r\nmainly of the processing of raw materials and of light manufacturing for\r\nthe domestic market. Diamond mining provides an important source of hard\r\ncurrency. The economy suffers from high unemployment, rising inflation,\r\nlarge trade deficits, and a growing dependency on foreign assistance.\r\nThe government in 1990 was attempting to get the budget deficit under\r\ncontrol and, in general, to bring economic policy in line with the\r\nrecommendations of the IMF and the World Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $1,302 million, per capita $325;

In 1985 the\r\neconomy registered its first drop in 20 years and achieved less than a 2%\r\nincrease in 1986. Recovery was strong based on rising demand for\r\nSingapore's products in OECD countries and improved competitiveness of\r\ndomestic manufactures. The economy grew 8.3% in 1990. Singapore's\r\nposition as a major oil refining and services center helped it weather\r\nthe Persian Gulf crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $34.6 billion, per capita $12,700; real growth rate 8.3%\r\n(1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 3.4% (1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: 1.7% (1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $8.0 billion;

Agriculture is the most important sector of\r\nthe economy, with the livestock sector accounting for about 40% of GDP\r\nand about 65% of export earnings. Nomads and seminomads who are\r\ndependent upon livestock for their livelihoods make up more than half\r\nof the population. Crop production generates only 10% of GDP and employs\r\nabout 20% of the work force. The main export crop is bananas; sugar,\r\nsorghum, and corn are grown for the domestic market. The small industrial\r\nsector is based on the processing of agricultural products and accounts\r\nfor less than 10% of GDP. Serious economic problems facing the nation are\r\nthe external debt of $1.9 billion and double-digit inflation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $1.7 billion, per capita $210; real growth rate - 1.4% (1988)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 81.7% (1988 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $190 million; expenditures $195 million, including\r\ncapital expenditures of $111 million (1989 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Exports: $58.0 million (f.o.b., 1988);\r\n\r\ncommodities--livestock, hides, skins, bananas, fish;\r\n\r\npartners--US 0.5%, Saudi Arabia, Italy, FRG (1986)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Imports: $354.0 million (c.i.f., 1988);\r\n\r\ncommodities--textiles, petroleum products, foodstuffs, construction\r\nmaterials;\r\n\r\npartners--US 13%, Italy, FRG, Kenya, UK, Saudi Arabia (1986)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_External debt: $1.9 billion (1989)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Industrial production: growth rate - 5.0% (1988); accounts for 5%\r\nof GDP\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Electricity: 72,000 kW capacity; 60 million kWh produced,\r\n7 kWh per capita (1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Industries: a few small industries, including sugar refining,\r\ntextiles, petroleum refining\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Agriculture: dominant sector, led by livestock raising (cattle,\r\nsheep, goats); crops--bananas, sorghum, corn, mangoes, sugarcane; not\r\nself-sufficient in food; fishing potential largely unexploited\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Economic aid: US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-89), $639\r\nmillion; Western (non-US) countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments\r\n(1970-87), $3.2 billion; OPEC bilateral aid (1979-89), $1.1 billion;\r\nCommunist countries (1970-89), $336 million\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Currency: Somali shilling (plural--shillings);\r\n1 Somali shilling (So.Sh.) = 100 centesimi\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Exchange rates: Somali shillings (So.

In contrast, most of the\r\nremaining population suffers from the poverty patterns of the Third\r\nWorld, including unemployment, lack of job skills, and barriers to\r\nmovement into higher-paying fields. Inputs and outputs thus do not move\r\nsmoothly into the most productive employments, and the effectiveness\r\nof the market is further lowered by international constraints on\r\ndealings with South Africa. The main strength of the economy lies in\r\nits rich mineral resources, which provide two-thirds of exports.\r\nAverage growth of less than 2% in output in recent years falls far short\r\nof the 5-6% level needed to cut into the high unemployment rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $101.7 billion, per capita $2,600;

The initial reforms have featured greater authority\r\nfor enterprise managers over prices, wages, product mix, investment,\r\nsources of supply, and customers. But in the absence of effective market\r\ndiscipline, the result has been the disappearance of low-price goods,\r\nexcessive wage increases, an even larger volume of unfinished\r\nconstruction projects, and, in general, continued economic stagnation.\r\nThe Gorbachev regime has made at least four serious errors in economic\r\npolicy in these six years: the unpopular and short-lived antialcohol\r\ncampaign; the initial cutback in imports of consumer goods; the failure\r\nto act decisively at the beginning for the privatization of agriculture;\r\nand the buildup of a massive overhang of unspent rubles in the hands of\r\nhouseholds and enterprises. The regime has vacillated among a series of\r\nambitious economic policy prescriptions put forth by leading economists\r\nand political leaders. The plans vary from proposals for (a) quick\r\nmarketization of the economy; (b) gradual marketization; (c) a period\r\nof retrenchment to ensure a stable base for future marketization; and\r\n(d) a return to disciplined central planning and allocation. The\r\neconomy, caught between two systems, is suffering from even greater\r\nmismatches between what is being produced and what would serve the best\r\ninterests of enterprises and households. Meanwhile, the seething\r\nnationality problems have been dislocating regional patterns of economic\r\nspecialization and pose a further major threat to growth prospects over\r\nthe next few years. Official Soviet statistics report GNP fell by 2% in\r\n1990, but the actual decline was substantially greater.

The economy is dominated\r\nby governmental entities that account for more than 70% of new\r\ninvestment. The private sector's main areas of activity are agriculture\r\nand trading, with most private industrial investment predating 1980. The\r\neconomy's base is agriculture, which employs 80% of the work force.\r\nIndustry mainly processes agricultural items. Sluggish economic\r\nperformance over the past decade, attributable largely to declining\r\nannual rainfall, has reduced levels of per capita income and\r\nconsumption.

The\r\neconomy has been in trouble since the Dutch ended development aid in\r\n1982. A drop in world bauxite prices that started in the late 1970s and\r\ncontinued until late 1986, was followed by the outbreak of a guerrilla\r\ninsurgency in the interior. The guerrillas targeted the economic\r\ninfrastructure, crippling the important bauxite sector and shutting down\r\nother export industries. These problems have created high inflation,\r\nhigh unemployment, widespread black market activity, and a bad climate\r\nfor foreign investment. A small gain in economic growth of 2.0% was\r\nregistered in 1989 due to reduced guerrilla activity and improved\r\ninternational markets for bauxite.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $1.35 billion, per capita $3,400;

It has essentially full employment,\r\na modern distribution system, excellent internal and external\r\ncommunications, and a skilled labor force. Timber, hydropower, and\r\niron ore constitute the resource base of an economy that is heavily\r\noriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms account for\r\nabout 90% of industrial output, of which the engineering\r\nsector accounts for 50% of output and exports. For some observers,\r\nthe Swedish model has succeeded in making economic efficiency\r\nand social egalitarianism complementary, rather than competitive,\r\ngoals. Others argue that the Swedish model is on the verge of\r\ncollapsing by pointing to the serious economic problems Sweden\r\nfaces in 1991: high inflation and absenteeism, growing unemployment\r\nand deficits, and declining international competitiveness. In 1990,\r\nto improve the economy, the government approved a mandate for\r\nSweden to seek EC membership and an austerity and privatization\r\npackage and implemented a major tax reform. These reforms may\r\nsucceed in turning the economy around in 1992.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $137.8 billion, per capita $16,200; real growth rate 0.3%\r\n(1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 10.9% (1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: 1.6% (1990)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $60.1 billion;

Per capita output, general living standards, education\r\nand science, health care, and diet are unsurpassed in Europe. Inflation\r\nremains low because of sound government policy and harmonious\r\nlabor-management relations. Unemployment is negligible, a marked\r\ncontrast to the larger economies of Western Europe. This economic\r\nstability helps promote the important banking and tourist sectors. Since\r\nWorld War II, Switzerland's economy has adjusted smoothly to the great\r\nchanges in output and trade patterns in Europe and presumably can adjust\r\nto the challenges of the 1990s, in particular, the further economic\r\nintegration of Western Europe and the amazingly rapid changes in East\r\nEuropean political/economic prospects.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $126 billion, per capita $18,700;

Economic difficulties are attributable, in part, to severe\r\ndrought in several recent years, costly but unsuccessful attempts\r\nto match Israel's military strength, a falloff in Arab aid, and\r\ninsufficient foreign exchange earnings to buy needed inputs for industry\r\nand agriculture. Socialist policy, embodied in a thicket of bureaucratic\r\nregulations, in many instances has driven away or pushed underground the\r\nmercantile and entrepreneurial spirit for which Syrian businessmen have\r\nlong been famous. Two bright spots: a sizable number of villagers have\r\nbenefited from land redistribution, electrification, and other rural\r\ndevelopment programs; and a recent find of light crude oil has enabled\r\nSyria to cut oil imports.

The increasingly sophisticated\r\nmanufacturing sector benefited from export-oriented investment, but\r\nthe agricultural sector contracted 2%, primarily because of weaker\r\ndemand in Thailand's major overseas markets for commodities such as\r\nrice. The trade deficit almost doubled in 1990, to $9 billion, but\r\nearnings from tourism ($4.7 billion), remittances, and net capital\r\ninflows helped keep the balance of payments in surplus. The government\r\nhas followed fairly sound fiscal and monetary policies, aided by\r\nincreased tax receipts from the fast-moving economy. In 1990 the\r\ngovernment approved new projects--especially for telecommunications\r\nand roads--needed to refurbish the country's now overtaxed\r\ninfrastructure. Although growth in 1991 will slow further, Thailand's\r\neconomic outlook remains good, assuming the continuation of prudent\r\ngovernment policies in the wake of the 23 February 1991 military coup.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GNP: $79 billion, per capita $1,400;

The economy fell sharply\r\nthrough most of the 1980s, largely because of the decline in oil prices.\r\nThis sector accounts for 80% of export earnings and more than 25% of\r\nGDP. The government, in response to the oil revenue loss, pursued a\r\nseries of austerity measures that pushed the unemployment rate as high\r\nas 22% in 1988. The economy showed signs of recovery in 1990, however,\r\nhelped along by rising oil prices. Agriculture employs only about 11% of\r\nthe labor force and produces about 3% of GDP.

The economy has grown\r\nsteadily since the early 1980s, with real growth in per capita GDP\r\nincreasing more than 6% annually. Agriculture remains the most important\r\neconomic sector, employing about 55% of the labor force, accounting for\r\nalmost 20% of GDP, and contributing about 20% to exports. Impressive\r\ngrowth in recent years has not solved all of the economic problems facing\r\nTurkey. Inflation and interest rates remain high, and a large budget\r\ndeficit will continue to provide difficulties for a country undergoing a\r\nsubstantial transformation from a centrally controlled to a free market\r\neconomy. The government has launched a multimillion-dollar development\r\nprogram in the southeastern region, which includes the building of a\r\ndozen dams on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers to generate electric power\r\nand irrigate large tracts of farmland. The planned tapping of huge\r\nadditional quantities of Euphrates water has raised serious concern in\r\nthe downstream riparian nations of Syria and Iraq.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $178.0 billion, per capita $3,100;

The economy has been devastated by much political\r\ninstability, mismanagement, and civil war since independence in 1962,\r\nkeeping Uganda poor with a per capita income of about $300. (GDP remains\r\nbelow the levels of the early 1970s, as does industrial production.)\r\nAgriculture is the most important sector of the economy, employing over\r\n80% of the work force. Coffee is the major export crop and accounts\r\nfor the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986 the government has\r\nacted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking\r\ncurrency reform, raising producer prices on export crops, increasing\r\npetroleum prices, and improving civil service wages. The policy changes\r\nare especially aimed at dampening inflation, which was running at over\r\n300% in 1987, and boosting production and export earnings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $4.9 billion, per capita $290 (1988);

The economy is essentially capitalistic with a generous admixture\r\nof social welfare programs and government ownership. Over the last decade\r\nthe Thatcher government halted the expansion of welfare measures and\r\npromoted extensive reprivatization of the government economic sector.\r\nAgriculture is intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European\r\nstandards, producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the labor\r\nforce. Industry is a mixture of public and private enterprises, employing\r\nabout 27% of the work force and generating 22% of GDP. The UK is an\r\nenergy-rich nation with large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves;\r\nprimary energy production accounts for 12% of GDP, one of the highest\r\nshares of any industrial nation. In mid-1990 the economy fell into\r\nrecession after eight years of strong economic expansion, which had\r\nraised national output by one quarter. Britain's inflation rate, which\r\nhas been consistently well above those of her major trading partners,\r\nis expected to decline in 1991. Between 1986 and 1990 unemployment\r\nfell from 11% to about 6%, but it is now rising rapidly because of\r\nthe economic slowdown. As a major trading nation, the UK will continue\r\nto be greatly affected by world boom or recession, swings in the\r\ninternational oil market, productivity trends in domestic industry,\r\nand the terms on which the economic integration of Europe proceeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $858.3 billion, per capita $15,000;

In 1989 the\r\neconomy enjoyed its seventh successive year of substantial growth, the\r\nlongest in peacetime history. The expansion featured moderation in\r\nwage and consumer price increases and a steady reduction in\r\nunemployment to 5.2% of the labor force. In 1990, however, growth\r\nslowed to 1% because of a combination of factors, such as the\r\nworldwide increase in interest rates, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in\r\nAugust, the subsequent spurt in oil prices, and a general decline\r\nin business and consumer confidence. Ongoing problems for the\r\n1990s include inadequate investment in education and other economic\r\ninfrastructure, rapidly rising medical costs, and sizable budget and\r\ntrade deficits.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GNP: $5,465 billion, per capita $21,800;

In 1988 real GDP grew by only 0.5% and in 1989 by\r\n1.5%. The recovery was led by growth in the agriculture and fishing\r\nsectors, agriculture alone contributing 20% to GDP, employing about 11%\r\nof the labor force, and generating a large proportion of export earnings.\r\nRaising livestock, particularly cattle and sheep, is the major\r\nagricultural activity. In 1990, despite healthy exports and an improved\r\ncurrent account, domestic growth remained weak because of government\r\nconcentration on the external sector, adverse weather conditions, and\r\nprolonged strikes. Bringing down high inflation, reducing a large fiscal\r\ndeficit, and avoiding frequent strikes remain major economic problems\r\nfor the government.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $9.2 billion, per capita $2,970;

the sector employs about 65% of\r\nthe labor force and accounts for almost half of GNP. Rice is the staple\r\ncrop; substantial amounts of maize, sorghum, cassava, and sweet potatoes\r\nare also grown. The government permits sale of surplus grain on the open\r\nmarket. Most of the mineral resources are located in the north,\r\nincluding coal, which is an important export item. Oil was discovered\r\noff the southern coast in 1986 with production reaching 54,000 b/d in\r\n1990 and expected to increase in the years ahead. Following the\r\nend of the war in 1975, heavy-handed government measures undermined\r\nefforts at an efficient merger of the agricultural resources of the\r\nsouth and the industrial resources of the north. The economy remains\r\nheavily dependent on foreign aid and has received assistance from\r\nCommunist countries, Sweden, and UN agencies. Inflation, although down\r\nfrom recent triple-digit levels, is still a major weakness and is\r\nshowing signs of accelerating upwards again. Per capita output is among\r\nthe world's lowest. Since late 1986 the government has sponsored a\r\nbroad reform program that seeks to turn more economic activity over to\r\nthe private sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GNP: $15.2 billion, per capita $230; real growth rate 2.4%\r\n(1990 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 65% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Unemployment rate: 33% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_Budget: revenues $892 million;

As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and\r\nreaffirmed by President Reagan's 1 September 1982 peace initiative, the\r\nfinal status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with\r\ntheir neighbors, and a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be\r\nnegotiated among the concerned parties. Camp David further specifies\r\nthat these negotiations will resolve the respective boundaries. Pending\r\nthe completion of this process, it is US policy that the final status of\r\nthe West Bank and the Gaza Strip has yet to be determined. In the view\r\nof the US, the term West Bank describes all of the area west of the\r\nJordan River under Jordanian administration before the 1967\r\nArab-Israeli war. However, with respect to negotiations envisaged in the\r\nframework agreement, it is US policy that a distinction must be made\r\nbetween Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the city's\r\nspecial status and circumstances. Therefore, a negotiated solution for\r\nthe final status of Jerusalem could be different in character from that\r\nof the rest of the West Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n_*_Geography\r\n_#_Total area: 5,860 km2; land area: 5,640 km2; includes West Bank,\r\nEast Jerusalem, Latrun Salient, Jerusalem No Man's Land, and the\r\nnorthwest quarter of the Dead Sea, but excludes Mt.

Capital investment has largely gone into residential\r\nhousing, not into productive assets that could compete with Israeli\r\nindustry. A major share of GNP is derived from remittances of workers\r\nemployed in Israel and neighboring Gulf states but remittances from the\r\nGulf dropped dramatically in the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in\r\nAugust 1990.

The technologically advanced areas--North America, Japan, and\r\nWestern Europe--together account for 67% of the gross world product (GWP)\r\nof $20.9 trillion; these developed areas grew in the aggregate at 2.3%\r\nin 1990. In contrast, output in the USSR and Eastern Europe fell an\r\naverage of 5.2%; these countries account for 15% of GWP. Experience\r\nin the developing countries continued mixed, with the newly\r\nindustrializing economies generally maintaining their rapid growth,\r\nand many others struggling with debt, rampant inflation, and inadequate\r\ninvestment. This third group contributed 18% of GWP and grew on\r\naverage 2.3% in 1990; output in this group is probably understated\r\nbecause of lack of data and the method of calculation used. The year 1990\r\nwitnessed continued political and economic upheavals in the USSR and\r\nEastern Europe, which are in between systems, lacking both the rough\r\ndiscipline of the command economy and the institutions of the market\r\neconomy.

Future\r\neconomic development depends heavily on Western-assisted development\r\nof promising oil resources. South Yemen's willingness to merge stemmed\r\npartly from the steady decline in Soviet economic support.\r\n\r\nNorth--The low level of domestic industry and agriculture have made\r\nnorthern Yemen dependent on imports for virtually all of its essential\r\nneeds. Large trade deficits have been made up for by remittances from\r\nYemenis working abroad and foreign aid. Once self-sufficient in food\r\nproduction, northern Yemen has been a major importer. Land once used for\r\nexport crops--cotton, fruit, and vegetables--has been turned over to\r\ngrowing qat, a mildly narcotic shrub chewed by Yemenis that has no\r\nsignificant export market. Oil export revenues started flowing in late\r\n1987 and boosted 1988 earnings by about $800 million.\r\n\r\nSouth--This has been one of the poorest Arab countries, with a per\r\ncapita GNP of about $500. A shortage of natural resources, a widely\r\ndispersed population, and an arid climate have made economic development\r\ndifficult. The economy has grown at an average annual rate of only 2-3%\r\nsince the mid-1970s. The economy had been organized along socialist\r\nlines, dominated by the public sector. Economic growth has been\r\nconstrained by a lack of incentives, partly stemming from centralized\r\ncontrol over production decisions, investment allocation, and import\r\nchoices.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $5.3 billion, per capita $545;

This\r\nprogram brought hyperinflation to a halt and encouraged a rise in\r\nforeign investment. Since June 1990, however, inflation has\r\nrebounded and threatens to rise further in 1991. Estimated annual\r\ninflation for 1990 is 164%. Other huge problems remain: rising\r\nunemployment, the low quality of industrial output, and striking\r\ndifferences in income between the poorer southern regions and the\r\ncomparatively well-off northern areas.

The country's chronic economic problems worsened in 1990,\r\nwith copper production down 20% to a 20-year low, inflation near\r\n250% compared with 100% in 1987-89, and IMF and most World Bank support\r\nsuspended until the institution of agreed-on changes. Agriculture, a key\r\nsector of the economy, employs 75% of the population but generates\r\nunder 25% of GDP. The main potential for economic development has been\r\nthe extractive industries. Mining and mineral processing account for\r\nabout one-third of GDP and two-thirds of total export earnings.\r\nZaire is the world's largest producer of diamonds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#_GDP: $6.6 billion, per capita $180;
