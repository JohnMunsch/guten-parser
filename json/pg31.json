So when\r\nin time a son was born the infant's feet were riveted together and he\r\nwas left to die on Mount Cithaeron. But a shepherd found the babe and\r\ntended him, and delivered him to another shepherd who took him to his\r\nmaster, the King of Corinth. Polybus being childless adopted the boy,\r\nwho grew up believing that he was indeed the King's son. Afterwards\r\ndoubting his parentage he inquired of the Delphic god and heard himself\r\nthe word declared before to Laius. Wherefore he fled from what he\r\ndeemed his father's house and in his flight he encountered and\r\nunwillingly slew his father Laius. Arriving at Thebes he answered the\r\nriddle of the Sphinx and the grateful Thebans made their deliverer king.\r\nSo he reigned in the room of Laius, and espoused the widowed queen.\r\nChildren were born to them and Thebes prospered under his rule, but\r\nagain a grievous plague fell upon the city. Again the oracle was\r\nconsulted and it bade them purge themselves of blood-guiltiness. Oedipus\r\ndenounces the crime of which he is unaware, and undertakes to track out\r\nthe criminal. Step by step it is brought home to him that he is the man.\r\nThe closing scene reveals Jocasta slain by her own hand and Oedipus\r\nblinded by his own act and praying for death or exile.\r\n\r\n                              *****\r\n\r\n                          DRAMATIS PERSONAE\r\n\r\n                               Oedipus.\r\n\r\n                         The Priest of Zeus.\r\n\r\n                                Creon.\r\n\r\n                       Chorus of Theban Elders.\r\n\r\n                              Teiresias.\r\n\r\n                               Jocasta.\r\n\r\n                              Messenger.\r\n\r\n                            Herd of Laius.\r\n\r\n                          Second Messenger.\r\n\r\n            Scene:  Thebes.

To them enter OEDIPUS.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nMy children, latest born to Cadmus old,\r\nWhy sit ye here as suppliants, in your hands\r\nBranches of olive filleted with wool?\r\nWhat means this reek of incense everywhere,\r\nAnd everywhere laments and litanies?\r\nChildren, it were not meet that I should learn\r\nFrom others, and am hither come, myself,\r\nI Oedipus, your world-renowned king.\r\nHo! aged sire, whose venerable locks\r\nProclaim thee spokesman of this company,\r\nExplain your mood and purport.  Is it dread\r\nOf ill that moves you or a boon ye crave?\r\nMy zeal in your behalf ye cannot doubt;\r\nRuthless indeed were I and obdurate\r\nIf such petitioners as you I spurned.\r\n\r\nPRIEST\r\nYea, Oedipus, my sovereign lord and king,\r\nThou seest how both extremes of age besiege\r\nThy palace altars--fledglings hardly winged,\r\nand greybeards bowed with years; priests, as am I\r\nof Zeus, and these the flower of our youth.\r\nMeanwhile, the common folk, with wreathed boughs\r\nCrowd our two market-places, or before\r\nBoth shrines of Pallas congregate, or where\r\nIsmenus gives his oracles by fire.\r\nFor, as thou seest thyself, our ship of State,\r\nSore buffeted, can no more lift her head,\r\nFoundered beneath a weltering surge of blood.\r\nA blight is on our harvest in the ear,\r\nA blight upon the grazing flocks and herds,\r\nA blight on wives in travail; and withal\r\nArmed with his blazing torch the God of Plague\r\nHath swooped upon our city emptying\r\nThe house of Cadmus, and the murky realm\r\nOf Pluto is full fed with groans and tears.\r\n     Therefore, O King, here at thy hearth we sit,\r\nI and these children; not as deeming thee\r\nA new divinity, but the first of men;\r\nFirst in the common accidents of life,\r\nAnd first in visitations of the Gods.\r\nArt thou not he who coming to the town\r\nof Cadmus freed us from the tax we paid\r\nTo the fell songstress?  Nor hadst thou received\r\nPrompting from us or been by others schooled;\r\nNo, by a god inspired (so all men deem,\r\nAnd testify) didst thou renew our life.\r\nAnd now, O Oedipus, our peerless king,\r\nAll we thy votaries beseech thee, find\r\nSome succor, whether by a voice from heaven\r\nWhispered, or haply known by human wit.\r\nTried counselors, methinks, are aptest found [1]\r\nTo furnish for the future pregnant rede.\r\nUpraise, O chief of men, upraise our State!\r\nLook to thy laurels! for thy zeal of yore\r\nOur country's savior thou art justly hailed:\r\nO never may we thus record thy reign:--\r\n\"He raised us up only to cast us down.\"\r\nUplift us, build our city on a rock.\r\nThy happy star ascendant brought us luck,\r\nO let it not decline!  If thou wouldst rule\r\nThis land, as now thou reignest, better sure\r\nTo rule a peopled than a desert realm.\r\nNor battlements nor galleys aught avail,\r\nIf men to man and guards to guard them tail.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nAh! my poor children, known, ah, known too well,\r\nThe quest that brings you hither and your need.\r\nYe sicken all, well wot I, yet my pain,\r\nHow great soever yours, outtops it all.\r\nYour sorrow touches each man severally,\r\nHim and none other, but I grieve at once\r\nBoth for the general and myself and you.\r\nTherefore ye rouse no sluggard from day-dreams.\r\nMany, my children, are the tears I've wept,\r\nAnd threaded many a maze of weary thought.\r\nThus pondering one clue of hope I caught,\r\nAnd tracked it up; I have sent Menoeceus' son,\r\nCreon, my consort's brother, to inquire\r\nOf Pythian Phoebus at his Delphic shrine,\r\nHow I might save the State by act or word.\r\nAnd now I reckon up the tale of days\r\nSince he set forth, and marvel how he fares.\r\n'Tis strange, this endless tarrying, passing strange.\r\nBut when he comes, then I were base indeed,\r\nIf I perform not all the god declares.\r\n\r\nPRIEST\r\nThy words are well timed; even as thou speakest\r\nThat shouting tells me Creon is at hand.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nO King Apollo! may his joyous looks\r\nBe presage of the joyous news he brings!\r\n\r\nPRIEST\r\nAs I surmise, 'tis welcome; else his head\r\nHad scarce been crowned with berry-laden bays.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nWe soon shall know; he's now in earshot range.\r\n[Enter CREON]\r\nMy royal cousin, say, Menoeceus' child,\r\nWhat message hast thou brought us from the god?\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nGood news, for e'en intolerable ills,\r\nFinding right issue, tend to naught but good.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nHow runs the oracle? thus far thy words\r\nGive me no ground for confidence or fear.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nIf thou wouldst hear my message publicly,\r\nI'll tell thee straight, or with thee pass within.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nSpeak before all; the burden that I bear\r\nIs more for these my subjects than myself.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nLet me report then all the god declared.\r\nKing Phoebus bids us straitly extirpate\r\nA fell pollution that infests the land,\r\nAnd no more harbor an inveterate sore.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nWhat expiation means he?  What's amiss?\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nBanishment, or the shedding blood for blood.\r\nThis stain of blood makes shipwreck of our state.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nWhom can he mean, the miscreant thus denounced?\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nBefore thou didst assume the helm of State,\r\nThe sovereign of this land was Laius.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nI heard as much, but never saw the man.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nHe fell; and now the god's command is plain:\r\nPunish his takers-off, whoe'er they be.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nWhere are they?  Where in the wide world to find\r\nThe far, faint traces of a bygone crime?\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nIn this land, said the god; \"who seeks shall find;\r\nWho sits with folded hands or sleeps is blind.\"\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nWas he within his palace, or afield,\r\nOr traveling, when Laius met his fate?\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nAbroad; he started, so he told us, bound\r\nFor Delphi, but he never thence returned.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nCame there no news, no fellow-traveler\r\nTo give some clue that might be followed up?\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nBut one escape, who flying for dear life,\r\nCould tell of all he saw but one thing sure.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nAnd what was that?  One clue might lead us far,\r\nWith but a spark of hope to guide our quest.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nRobbers, he told us, not one bandit but\r\nA troop of knaves, attacked and murdered him.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nDid any bandit dare so bold a stroke,\r\nUnless indeed he were suborned from Thebes?\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nSo 'twas surmised, but none was found to avenge\r\nHis murder mid the trouble that ensued.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nWhat trouble can have hindered a full quest,\r\nWhen royalty had fallen thus miserably?\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nThe riddling Sphinx compelled us to let slide\r\nThe dim past and attend to instant needs.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nWell, _I_ will start afresh and once again\r\nMake dark things clear.  Right worthy the concern\r\nOf Phoebus, worthy thine too, for the dead;\r\nI also, as is meet, will lend my aid\r\nTo avenge this wrong to Thebes and to the god.\r\nNot for some far-off kinsman, but myself,\r\nShall I expel this poison in the blood;\r\nFor whoso slew that king might have a mind\r\nTo strike me too with his assassin hand.\r\nTherefore in righting him I serve myself.\r\nUp, children, haste ye, quit these altar stairs,\r\nTake hence your suppliant wands, go summon hither\r\nThe Theban commons.  With the god's good help\r\nSuccess is sure; 'tis ruin if we fail.\r\n[Exeunt OEDIPUS and CREON]\r\n\r\nPRIEST\r\nCome, children, let us hence; these gracious words\r\nForestall the very purpose of our suit.\r\nAnd may the god who sent this oracle\r\nSave us withal and rid us of this pest.\r\n[Exeunt PRIEST and SUPPLIANTS]\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\n(Str. 1)\r\nSweet-voiced daughter of Zeus from thy gold-paved Pythian shrine\r\n          Wafted to Thebes divine,\r\nWhat dost thou bring me?  My soul is racked and shivers with fear.\r\n          (Healer of Delos, hear!)\r\nHast thou some pain unknown before,\r\nOr with the circling years renewest a penance of yore?\r\nOffspring of golden Hope, thou voice immortal, O tell me.\r\n\r\n(Ant. 1)\r\nFirst on Athene I call; O Zeus-born goddess, defend!\r\n          Goddess and sister, befriend,\r\nArtemis, Lady of Thebes, high-throned in the midst of our mart!\r\n          Lord of the death-winged dart!\r\n            Your threefold aid I crave\r\n     From death and ruin our city to save.\r\nIf in the days of old when we nigh had perished, ye drave\r\nFrom our land the fiery plague, be near us now and defend us!\r\n\r\n(Str. 2)\r\n     Ah me, what countless woes are mine!\r\n     All our host is in decline;\r\n     Weaponless my spirit lies.\r\n     Earth her gracious fruits denies;\r\n     Women wail in barren throes;\r\n     Life on life downstriken goes,\r\n     Swifter than the wind bird's flight,\r\n     Swifter than the Fire-God's might,\r\n     To the westering shores of Night.\r\n\r\n(Ant. 2)\r\n     Wasted thus by death on death\r\n     All our city perisheth.\r\n     Corpses spread infection round;\r\n     None to tend or mourn is found.\r\n     Wailing on the altar stair\r\n     Wives and grandams rend the air--\r\n     Long-drawn moans and piercing cries\r\n     Blent with prayers and litanies.\r\n     Golden child of Zeus, O hear\r\n     Let thine angel face appear!\r\n\r\n(Str. 3)\r\nAnd grant that Ares whose hot breath I feel,\r\n          Though without targe or steel\r\nHe stalks, whose voice is as the battle shout,\r\nMay turn in sudden rout,\r\nTo the unharbored Thracian waters sped,\r\n          Or Amphitrite's bed.\r\n     For what night leaves undone,\r\n     Smit by the morrow's sun\r\nPerisheth.  Father Zeus, whose hand\r\nDoth wield the lightning brand,\r\nSlay him beneath thy levin bold, we pray,\r\n          Slay him, O slay!\r\n\r\n(Ant. 3)\r\nO that thine arrows too, Lycean King,\r\n          From that taut bow's gold string,\r\nMight fly abroad, the champions of our rights;\r\n          Yea, and the flashing lights\r\nOf Artemis, wherewith the huntress sweeps\r\n          Across the Lycian steeps.\r\nThee too I call with golden-snooded hair,\r\n          Whose name our land doth bear,\r\nBacchus to whom thy Maenads Evoe shout;\r\n          Come with thy bright torch, rout,\r\n               Blithe god whom we adore,\r\n               The god whom gods abhor.\r\n\r\n[Enter OEDIPUS.]\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nYe pray; 'tis well, but would ye hear my words\r\nAnd heed them and apply the remedy,\r\nYe might perchance find comfort and relief.\r\nMind you, I speak as one who comes a stranger\r\nTo this report, no less than to the crime;\r\nFor how unaided could I track it far\r\nWithout a clue?  Which lacking (for too late\r\nWas I enrolled a citizen of Thebes)\r\nThis proclamation I address to all:--\r\nThebans, if any knows the man by whom\r\nLaius, son of Labdacus, was slain,\r\nI summon him to make clean shrift to me.\r\nAnd if he shrinks, let him reflect that thus\r\nConfessing he shall 'scape the capital charge;\r\nFor the worst penalty that shall befall him\r\nIs banishment--unscathed he shall depart.\r\nBut if an alien from a foreign land\r\nBe known to any as the murderer,\r\nLet him who knows speak out, and he shall have\r\nDue recompense from me and thanks to boot.\r\nBut if ye still keep silence, if through fear\r\nFor self or friends ye disregard my hest,\r\nHear what I then resolve; I lay my ban\r\nOn the assassin whosoe'er he be.\r\nLet no man in this land, whereof I hold\r\nThe sovereign rule, harbor or speak to him;\r\nGive him no part in prayer or sacrifice\r\nOr lustral rites, but hound him from your homes.\r\nFor this is our defilement, so the god\r\nHath lately shown to me by oracles.\r\nThus as their champion I maintain the cause\r\nBoth of the god and of the murdered King.\r\nAnd on the murderer this curse I lay\r\n(On him and all the partners in his guilt):--\r\nWretch, may he pine in utter wretchedness!\r\nAnd for myself, if with my privity\r\nHe gain admittance to my hearth, I pray\r\nThe curse I laid on others fall on me.\r\nSee that ye give effect to all my hest,\r\nFor my sake and the god's and for our land,\r\nA desert blasted by the wrath of heaven.\r\nFor, let alone the god's express command,\r\nIt were a scandal ye should leave unpurged\r\nThe murder of a great man and your king,\r\nNor track it home.  And now that I am lord,\r\nSuccessor to his throne, his bed, his wife,\r\n(And had he not been frustrate in the hope\r\nOf issue, common children of one womb\r\nHad forced a closer bond twixt him and me,\r\nBut Fate swooped down upon him), therefore I\r\nHis blood-avenger will maintain his cause\r\nAs though he were my sire, and leave no stone\r\nUnturned to track the assassin or avenge\r\nThe son of Labdacus, of Polydore,\r\nOf Cadmus, and Agenor first of the race.\r\nAnd for the disobedient thus I pray:\r\nMay the gods send them neither timely fruits\r\nOf earth, nor teeming increase of the womb,\r\nBut may they waste and pine, as now they waste,\r\nAye and worse stricken; but to all of you,\r\nMy loyal subjects who approve my acts,\r\nMay Justice, our ally, and all the gods\r\nBe gracious and attend you evermore.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nThe oath thou profferest, sire, I take and swear.\r\nI slew him not myself, nor can I name\r\nThe slayer.  For the quest, 'twere well, methinks\r\nThat Phoebus, who proposed the riddle, himself\r\nShould give the answer--who the murderer was.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nWell argued; but no living man can hope\r\nTo force the gods to speak against their will.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nMay I then say what seems next best to me?\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nAye, if there be a third best, tell it too.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nMy liege, if any man sees eye to eye\r\nWith our lord Phoebus, 'tis our prophet, lord\r\nTeiresias; he of all men best might guide\r\nA searcher of this matter to the light.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nHere too my zeal has nothing lagged, for twice\r\nAt Creon's instance have I sent to fetch him,\r\nAnd long I marvel why he is not here.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nI mind me too of rumors long ago--\r\nMere gossip.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\n               Tell them, I would fain know all.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\n'Twas said he fell by travelers.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\n                                   So I heard,\r\nBut none has seen the man who saw him fall.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nWell, if he knows what fear is, he will quail\r\nAnd flee before the terror of thy curse.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nWords scare not him who blenches not at deeds.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nBut here is one to arraign him.  Lo, at length\r\nThey bring the god-inspired seer in whom\r\nAbove all other men is truth inborn.\r\n[Enter TEIRESIAS, led by a boy.]\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nTeiresias, seer who comprehendest all,\r\nLore of the wise and hidden mysteries,\r\nHigh things of heaven and low things of the earth,\r\nThou knowest, though thy blinded eyes see naught,\r\nWhat plague infects our city; and we turn\r\nTo thee, O seer, our one defense and shield.\r\nThe purport of the answer that the God\r\nReturned to us who sought his oracle,\r\nThe messengers have doubtless told thee--how\r\nOne course alone could rid us of the pest,\r\nTo find the murderers of Laius,\r\nAnd slay them or expel them from the land.\r\nTherefore begrudging neither augury\r\nNor other divination that is thine,\r\nO save thyself, thy country, and thy king,\r\nSave all from this defilement of blood shed.\r\nOn thee we rest.  This is man's highest end,\r\nTo others' service all his powers to lend.\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\nAlas, alas, what misery to be wise\r\nWhen wisdom profits nothing!  This old lore\r\nI had forgotten; else I were not here.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nWhat ails thee?  Why this melancholy mood?\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\nLet me go home; prevent me not; 'twere best\r\nThat thou shouldst bear thy burden and I mine.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nFor shame! no true-born Theban patriot\r\nWould thus withhold the word of prophecy.\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\n_Thy_ words, O king, are wide of the mark, and I\r\nFor fear lest I too trip like thee...\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\n                                        Oh speak,\r\nWithhold not, I adjure thee, if thou know'st,\r\nThy knowledge.  We are all thy suppliants.\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\nAye, for ye all are witless, but my voice\r\nWill ne'er reveal my miseries--or thine. [2]\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nWhat then, thou knowest, and yet willst not speak!\r\nWouldst thou betray us and destroy the State?\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\nI will not vex myself nor thee.  Why ask\r\nThus idly what from me thou shalt not learn?\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nMonster! thy silence would incense a flint.\r\nWill nothing loose thy tongue?  Can nothing melt thee,\r\nOr shake thy dogged taciturnity?\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\nThou blam'st my mood and seest not thine own\r\nWherewith thou art mated; no, thou taxest me.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nAnd who could stay his choler when he heard\r\nHow insolently thou dost flout the State?\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\nWell, it will come what will, though I be mute.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nSince come it must, thy duty is to tell me.\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\nI have no more to say; storm as thou willst,\r\nAnd give the rein to all thy pent-up rage.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nYea, I am wroth, and will not stint my words,\r\nBut speak my whole mind.  Thou methinks thou art he,\r\nWho planned the crime, aye, and performed it too,\r\nAll save the assassination; and if thou\r\nHadst not been blind, I had been sworn to boot\r\nThat thou alone didst do the bloody deed.\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\nIs it so?  Then I charge thee to abide\r\nBy thine own proclamation; from this day\r\nSpeak not to these or me.  Thou art the man,\r\nThou the accursed polluter of this land.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nVile slanderer, thou blurtest forth these taunts,\r\nAnd think'st forsooth as seer to go scot free.\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\nYea, I am free, strong in the strength of truth.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nWho was thy teacher? not methinks thy art.\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\nThou, goading me against my will to speak.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nWhat speech? repeat it and resolve my doubt.\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\nDidst miss my sense wouldst thou goad me on?\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nI but half caught thy meaning; say it again.\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\nI say thou art the murderer of the man\r\nWhose murderer thou pursuest.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\n                              Thou shalt rue it\r\nTwice to repeat so gross a calumny.\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\nMust I say more to aggravate thy rage?\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nSay all thou wilt; it will be but waste of breath.\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\nI say thou livest with thy nearest kin\r\nIn infamy, unwitting in thy shame.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nThink'st thou for aye unscathed to wag thy tongue?\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\nYea, if the might of truth can aught prevail.\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nWith other men, but not with thee, for thou\r\nIn ear, wit, eye, in everything art blind.\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\nPoor fool to utter gibes at me which all\r\nHere present will cast back on thee ere long.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nOffspring of endless Night, thou hast no power\r\nO'er me or any man who sees the sun.\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\nNo, for thy weird is not to fall by me.\r\nI leave to Apollo what concerns the god.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nIs this a plot of Creon, or thine own?\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\nNot Creon, thou thyself art thine own bane.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nO wealth and empiry and skill by skill\r\nOutwitted in the battlefield of life,\r\nWhat spite and envy follow in your train!\r\nSee, for this crown the State conferred on me.\r\nA gift, a thing I sought not, for this crown\r\nThe trusty Creon, my familiar friend,\r\nHath lain in wait to oust me and suborned\r\nThis mountebank, this juggling charlatan,\r\nThis tricksy beggar-priest, for gain alone\r\nKeen-eyed, but in his proper art stone-blind.\r\nSay, sirrah, hast thou ever proved thyself\r\nA prophet?  When the riddling Sphinx was here\r\nWhy hadst thou no deliverance for this folk?\r\nAnd yet the riddle was not to be solved\r\nBy guess-work but required the prophet's art;\r\nWherein thou wast found lacking; neither birds\r\nNor sign from heaven helped thee, but _I_ came,\r\nThe simple Oedipus; _I_ stopped her mouth\r\nBy mother wit, untaught of auguries.\r\nThis is the man whom thou wouldst undermine,\r\nIn hope to reign with Creon in my stead.\r\nMethinks that thou and thine abettor soon\r\nWill rue your plot to drive the scapegoat out.\r\nThank thy grey hairs that thou hast still to learn\r\nWhat chastisement such arrogance deserves.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nTo us it seems that both the seer and thou,\r\nO Oedipus, have spoken angry words.\r\nThis is no time to wrangle but consult\r\nHow best we may fulfill the oracle.\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\nKing as thou art, free speech at least is mine\r\nTo make reply; in this I am thy peer.\r\nI own no lord but Loxias; him I serve\r\nAnd ne'er can stand enrolled as Creon's man.\r\nThus then I answer:  since thou hast not spared\r\nTo twit me with my blindness--thou hast eyes,\r\nYet see'st not in what misery thou art fallen,\r\nNor where thou dwellest nor with whom for mate.\r\nDost know thy lineage?  Nay, thou know'st it not,\r\nAnd all unwitting art a double foe\r\nTo thine own kin, the living and the dead;\r\nAye and the dogging curse of mother and sire\r\nOne day shall drive thee, like a two-edged sword,\r\nBeyond our borders, and the eyes that now\r\nSee clear shall henceforward endless night.\r\nAh whither shall thy bitter cry not reach,\r\nWhat crag in all Cithaeron but shall then\r\nReverberate thy wail, when thou hast found\r\nWith what a hymeneal thou wast borne\r\nHome, but to no fair haven, on the gale!\r\nAye, and a flood of ills thou guessest not\r\nShall set thyself and children in one line.\r\nFlout then both Creon and my words, for none\r\nOf mortals shall be striken worse than thou.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nMust I endure this fellow's insolence?\r\nA murrain on thee!  Get thee hence!  Begone\r\nAvaunt! and never cross my threshold more.\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\nI ne'er had come hadst thou not bidden me.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nI know not thou wouldst utter folly, else\r\nLong hadst thou waited to be summoned here.\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\nSuch am I--as it seems to thee a fool,\r\nBut to the parents who begat thee, wise.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nWhat sayest thou--\"parents\"?  Who begat me, speak?\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\nThis day shall be thy birth-day, and thy grave.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nThou lov'st to speak in riddles and dark words.\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\nIn reading riddles who so skilled as thou?\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nTwit me with that wherein my greatness lies.\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\nAnd yet this very greatness proved thy bane.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nNo matter if I saved the commonwealth.\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\n'Tis time I left thee.  Come, boy, take me home.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nAye, take him quickly, for his presence irks\r\nAnd lets me; gone, thou canst not plague me more.\r\n\r\nTEIRESIAS\r\nI go, but first will tell thee why I came.\r\nThy frown I dread not, for thou canst not harm me.\r\nHear then:  this man whom thou hast sought to arrest\r\nWith threats and warrants this long while, the wretch\r\nWho murdered Laius--that man is here.\r\nHe passes for an alien in the land\r\nBut soon shall prove a Theban, native born.\r\nAnd yet his fortune brings him little joy;\r\nFor blind of seeing, clad in beggar's weeds,\r\nFor purple robes, and leaning on his staff,\r\nTo a strange land he soon shall grope his way.\r\nAnd of the children, inmates of his home,\r\nHe shall be proved the brother and the sire,\r\nOf her who bare him son and husband both,\r\nCo-partner, and assassin of his sire.\r\nGo in and ponder this, and if thou find\r\nThat I have missed the mark, henceforth declare\r\nI have no wit nor skill in prophecy.\r\n[Exeunt TEIRESIAS and OEDIPUS]\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\n(Str. 1)\r\nWho is he by voice immortal named from Pythia's rocky cell,\r\nDoer of foul deeds of bloodshed, horrors that no tongue can tell?\r\n          A foot for flight he needs\r\n          Fleeter than storm-swift steeds,\r\n          For on his heels doth follow,\r\nArmed with the lightnings of his Sire, Apollo.\r\n          Like sleuth-hounds too\r\n          The Fates pursue.\r\n\r\n(Ant. 1)\r\nYea, but now flashed forth the summons from Parnassus' snowy peak,\r\n\"Near and far the undiscovered doer of this murder seek!\"\r\n          Now like a sullen bull he roves\r\n          Through forest brakes and upland groves,\r\n          And vainly seeks to fly\r\n          The doom that ever nigh\r\n          Flits o'er his head,\r\nStill by the avenging Phoebus sped,\r\n          The voice divine,\r\n          From Earth's mid shrine.\r\n(Str. 2)\r\nSore perplexed am I by the words of the master seer.\r\nAre  they true, are they false?

Thou hast spoken, 'tis my turn\r\nTo make reply.  Then having heard me, judge.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nThou art glib of tongue, but I am slow to learn\r\nOf thee; I know too well thy venomous hate.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nFirst I would argue out this very point.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nO argue not that thou art not a rogue.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nIf thou dost count a virtue stubbornness,\r\nUnschooled by reason, thou art much astray.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nIf thou dost hold a kinsman may be wronged,\r\nAnd no pains follow, thou art much to seek.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nTherein thou judgest rightly, but this wrong\r\nThat thou allegest--tell me what it is.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nDidst thou or didst thou not advise that I\r\nShould call the priest?\r\n\r\nCREON\r\n                         Yes, and I stand to it.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nTell me how long is it since Laius...\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nSince Laius...?

First, I bid thee think,\r\nWould any mortal choose a troubled reign\r\nOf terrors rather than secure repose,\r\nIf the same power were given him?  As for me,\r\nI have no natural craving for the name\r\nOf king, preferring to do kingly deeds,\r\nAnd so thinks every sober-minded man.\r\nNow all my needs are satisfied through thee,\r\nAnd I have naught to fear; but were I king,\r\nMy acts would oft run counter to my will.\r\nHow could a title then have charms for me\r\nAbove the sweets of boundless influence?\r\nI am not so infatuate as to grasp\r\nThe shadow when I hold the substance fast.\r\nNow all men cry me Godspeed! wish me well,\r\nAnd every suitor seeks to gain my ear,\r\nIf he would hope to win a grace from thee.\r\nWhy should I leave the better, choose the worse?\r\nThat were sheer madness, and I am not mad.\r\nNo such ambition ever tempted me,\r\nNor would I have a share in such intrigue.\r\nAnd if thou doubt me, first to Delphi go,\r\nThere ascertain if my report was true\r\nOf the god's answer; next investigate\r\nIf with the seer I plotted or conspired,\r\nAnd if it prove so, sentence me to death,\r\nNot by thy voice alone, but mine and thine.\r\nBut O condemn me not, without appeal,\r\nOn bare suspicion.  'Tis not right to adjudge\r\nBad men at random good, or good men bad.\r\nI would as lief a man should cast away\r\nThe thing he counts most precious, his own life,\r\nAs spurn a true friend.  Thou wilt learn in time\r\nThe truth, for time alone reveals the just;\r\nA villain is detected in a day.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nTo one who walketh warily his words\r\nCommend themselves; swift counsels are not sure.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nWhen with swift strides the stealthy plotter stalks\r\nI must be quick too with my counterplot.\r\nTo wait his onset passively, for him\r\nIs sure success, for me assured defeat.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nWhat then's thy will?  To banish me the land?\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nI would not have thee banished, no, but dead,\r\nThat men may mark the wages envy reaps.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nI see thou wilt not yield, nor credit me.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\n[None but a fool would credit such as thou.] [3]\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nThou art not wise.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\n                    Wise for myself at least.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nWhy not for me too?\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\n                    Why for such a knave?\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nSuppose thou lackest sense.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\n                              Yet kings must rule.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nNot if they rule ill.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\n                         Oh my Thebans, hear him!\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nThy Thebans? am not I a Theban too?\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nCease, princes; lo there comes, and none too soon,\r\nJocasta from the palace.

O king,\r\nRegard it not.  Whate'er the god deems fit\r\nTo search, himself unaided will reveal.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nWhat memories, what wild tumult of the soul\r\nCame o'er me, lady, as I heard thee speak!\r\n\r\nJOCASTA\r\nWhat mean'st thou?  What has shocked and startled thee?\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nMethought I heard thee say that Laius\r\nWas murdered at the meeting of three roads.\r\n\r\nJOCASTA\r\nSo ran the story that is current still.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nWhere did this happen?  Dost thou know the place?\r\n\r\nJOCASTA\r\nPhocis the land is called; the spot is where\r\nBranch roads from Delphi and from Daulis meet.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nAnd how long is it since these things befell?\r\n\r\nJOCASTA\r\n'Twas but a brief while were thou wast proclaimed\r\nOur country's ruler that the news was brought.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nO Zeus, what hast thou willed to do with me!\r\n\r\nJOCASTA\r\nWhat is it, Oedipus, that moves thee so?\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nAsk me not yet; tell me the build and height\r\nOf Laius?  Was he still in manhood's prime?\r\n\r\nJOCASTA\r\nTall was he, and his hair was lightly strewn\r\nWith silver; and not unlike thee in form.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nO woe is me!  Mehtinks unwittingly\r\nI laid but now a dread curse on myself.\r\n\r\nJOCASTA\r\nWhat say'st thou?  When I look upon thee, my king,\r\nI tremble.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\n          'Tis a dread presentiment\r\nThat in the end the seer will prove not blind.\r\nOne further question to resolve my doubt.\r\n\r\nJOCASTA\r\nI quail; but ask, and I will answer all.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nHad he but few attendants or a train\r\nOf armed retainers with him, like a prince?\r\n\r\nJOCASTA\r\nThey were but five in all, and one of them\r\nA herald; Laius in a mule-car rode.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nAlas! 'tis clear as noonday now.  But say,\r\nLady, who carried this report to Thebes?\r\n\r\nJOCASTA\r\nA serf, the sole survivor who returned.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nHaply he is at hand or in the house?\r\n\r\nJOCASTA\r\nNo, for as soon as he returned and found\r\nThee reigning in the stead of Laius slain,\r\nHe clasped my hand and supplicated me\r\nTo send him to the alps and pastures, where\r\nHe might be farthest from the sight of Thebes.\r\nAnd so I sent him.  'Twas an honest slave\r\nAnd well deserved some better recompense.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nFetch him at once.  I fain would see the man.\r\n\r\nJOCASTA\r\nHe shall be brought; but wherefore summon him?\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nLady, I fear my tongue has overrun\r\nDiscretion; therefore I would question him.\r\n\r\nJOCASTA\r\nWell, he shall come, but may not I too claim\r\nTo share the burden of thy heart, my king?\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nAnd thou shalt not be frustrate of thy wish.\r\nNow my imaginings have gone so far.\r\nWho has a higher claim that thou to hear\r\nMy tale of dire adventures?  Listen then.\r\nMy sire was Polybus of Corinth, and\r\nMy mother Merope, a Dorian;\r\nAnd I was held the foremost citizen,\r\nTill a strange thing befell me, strange indeed,\r\nYet scarce deserving all the heat it stirred.\r\nA roisterer at some banquet, flown with wine,\r\nShouted \"Thou art not true son of thy sire.\"\r\nIt irked me, but I stomached for the nonce\r\nThe insult; on the morrow I sought out\r\nMy mother and my sire and questioned them.\r\nThey were indignant at the random slur\r\nCast on my parentage and did their best\r\nTo comfort me, but still the venomed barb\r\nRankled, for still the scandal spread and grew.\r\nSo privily without their leave I went\r\nTo Delphi, and Apollo sent me back\r\nBaulked of the knowledge that I came to seek.\r\nBut other grievous things he prophesied,\r\nWoes, lamentations, mourning, portents dire;\r\nTo wit I should defile my mother's bed\r\nAnd raise up seed too loathsome to behold,\r\nAnd slay the father from whose loins I sprang.\r\nThen, lady,--thou shalt hear the very truth--\r\nAs I drew near the triple-branching roads,\r\nA herald met me and a man who sat\r\nIn a car drawn by colts--as in thy tale--\r\nThe man in front and the old man himself\r\nThreatened to thrust me rudely from the path,\r\nThen jostled by the charioteer in wrath\r\nI struck him, and the old man, seeing this,\r\nWatched till I passed and from his car brought down\r\nFull on my head the double-pointed goad.\r\n     Yet was I quits with him and more; one stroke\r\nOf my good staff sufficed to fling him clean\r\nOut of the chariot seat and laid him prone.\r\nAnd so I slew them every one.  But if\r\nBetwixt this stranger there was aught in common\r\nWith Laius, who more miserable than I,\r\nWhat mortal could you find more god-abhorred?\r\nWretch whom no sojourner, no citizen\r\nMay harbor or address, whom all are bound\r\nTo harry from their homes.  And this same curse\r\nWas laid on me, and laid by none but me.\r\nYea with  these hands all gory I pollute\r\nThe bed of him I slew.  Say, am I vile?\r\nAm I not utterly unclean, a wretch\r\nDoomed to be banished, and in banishment\r\nForgo the sight of all my dearest ones,\r\nAnd never tread again my native earth;\r\nOr else to wed my mother and slay my sire,\r\nPolybus, who begat me and upreared?\r\nIf one should say, this is the handiwork\r\nOf some inhuman power, who could blame\r\nHis judgment?  But, ye pure and awful gods,\r\nForbid, forbid that I should see that day!\r\nMay I be blotted out from living men\r\nEre such a plague spot set on me its brand!\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nWe too, O king, are troubled; but till thou\r\nHast questioned the survivor, still hope on.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nMy hope is faint, but still enough survives\r\nTo bid me bide the coming of this herd.\r\n\r\nJOCASTA\r\nSuppose him here, what wouldst thou learn of him?\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nI'll tell thee, lady; if his tale agrees\r\nWith thine, I shall have 'scaped calamity.\r\n\r\nJOCASTA\r\nAnd what of special import did I say?\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nIn thy report of what the herdsman said\r\nLaius was slain by robbers; now if he\r\nStill speaks of robbers, not a robber, I\r\nSlew him not; \"one\" with \"many\" cannot square.\r\nBut if he says one lonely wayfarer,\r\nThe last link wanting to my guilt is forged.\r\n\r\nJOCASTA\r\nWell, rest assured, his tale ran thus at first,\r\nNor can he now retract what then he said;\r\nNot I alone but all our townsfolk heard it.\r\nE'en should he vary somewhat in his story,\r\nHe cannot make the death of Laius\r\nIn any wise jump with the oracle.\r\nFor Loxias said expressly he was doomed\r\nTo die by my child's hand, but he, poor babe,\r\nHe shed no blood, but perished first himself.\r\nSo much for divination.  Henceforth I\r\nWill look for signs neither to right nor left.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nThou reasonest well.  Still I would have thee send\r\nAnd fetch the bondsman hither.  See to it.\r\n\r\nJOCASTA\r\nThat will I straightway.  Come, let us within.\r\nI would do nothing that my lord mislikes.\r\n[Exeunt OEDIPUS and JOCASTA]\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\n(Str. 1)\r\nMy lot be still to lead\r\n     The life of innocence and fly\r\nIrreverence in word or deed,\r\n     To follow still those laws ordained on high\r\nWhose birthplace is the bright ethereal sky\r\n     No mortal birth they own,\r\n     Olympus their progenitor alone:\r\nNe'er shall they slumber in oblivion cold,\r\nThe god in them is strong and grows not old.\r\n\r\n(Ant. 1)\r\n     Of insolence is bred\r\nThe tyrant; insolence full blown,\r\n     With empty riches surfeited,\r\nScales the precipitous height and grasps the throne.\r\n     Then topples o'er and lies in ruin prone;\r\n     No foothold on that dizzy steep.\r\nBut O may Heaven the true patriot keep\r\nWho burns with emulous zeal to serve the State.\r\nGod is my help and hope, on him I wait.\r\n\r\n(Str. 2)\r\nBut the proud sinner, or in word or deed,\r\n     That will not Justice heed,\r\n     Nor reverence the shrine\r\n     Of images divine,\r\nPerdition seize his vain imaginings,\r\n     If, urged by greed profane,\r\n     He grasps at ill-got gain,\r\nAnd lays an impious hand on holiest things.\r\n     Who when such deeds are done\r\n     Can hope heaven's bolts to shun?\r\nIf sin like this to honor can aspire,\r\nWhy dance I still and lead the sacred choir?\r\n\r\n(Ant. 2)\r\nNo more I'll seek earth's central oracle,\r\n     Or Abae's hallowed cell,\r\n     Nor to Olympia bring\r\n     My votive offering.\r\nIf before all God's truth be not bade plain.\r\n     O Zeus, reveal thy might,\r\n     King, if thou'rt named aright\r\nOmnipotent, all-seeing, as of old;\r\n     For Laius is forgot;\r\n     His weird, men heed it not;\r\nApollo is forsook and faith grows cold.\r\n[Enter JOCASTA.]\r\n\r\nJOCASTA\r\nMy lords, ye look amazed to see your queen\r\nWith wreaths and gifts of incense in her hands.\r\nI had a mind to visit the high shrines,\r\nFor Oedipus is overwrought, alarmed\r\nWith terrors manifold.

But Oedipus, instructed by an\r\noracle that he had reached his final resting-place, refuses to stir, and\r\nthe stranger consents to go and consult the Elders of Colonus (the\r\nChorus of the Play). Conducted to the spot they pity at first the blind\r\nbeggar and his daughter, but on learning his name they are horror-\r\nstriken and order him to quit the land. He appeals to the world-famed\r\nhospitality of Athens and hints at the blessings that his coming will\r\nconfer on the State. They agree to await the decision of King Theseus.\r\nFrom Theseus Oedipus craves protection in life and burial in Attic soil;\r\nthe benefits that will accrue shall be told later. Theseus departs\r\nhaving promised to aid and befriend him. No sooner has he gone than\r\nCreon enters with an armed guard who seize Antigone and carry her off\r\n(Ismene, the other sister, they have already captured) and he is about\r\nto lay hands on Oedipus, when Theseus, who has heard the tumult, hurries\r\nup and, upbraiding Creon for his lawless act, threatens to detain him\r\ntill he has shown where the captives are and restored them. In the next\r\nscene Theseus returns bringing with him the rescued maidens. He informs\r\nOedipus that a stranger who has taken sanctuary at the altar of Poseidon\r\nwishes to see him. It is Polyneices who has come to crave his father's\r\nforgiveness and blessing, knowing by an oracle that victory will fall to\r\nthe side that Oedipus espouses. But Oedipus spurns the hypocrite, and\r\ninvokes a dire curse on both his unnatural sons. A sudden clap of\r\nthunder is heard, and as peal follows peal, Oedipus is aware that his\r\nhour is come and bids Antigone summon Theseus. Self-guided he leads the\r\nway to the spot where death should overtake him, attended by Theseus and\r\nhis daughters. Halfway he bids his daughters farewell, and what followed\r\nnone but Theseus knew. He was not (so the Messenger reports) for the\r\ngods took him.\r\n\r\n                              *****\r\n\r\n                          DRAMATIS PERSONAE\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS, banished King of Thebes.\r\nANTIGONE, his daughter.\r\nISMENE, his daughter.\r\nTHESEUS, King of Athens.\r\nCREON, brother of Jocasta, now reigning at Thebes.\r\nPOLYNEICES, elder son of Oedipus.\r\nSTRANGER, a native of Colonus.\r\nMESSENGER, an attendant of Theseus.\r\nCHORUS, citizens of Colonus.\r\n\r\n     Scene:  In front of the grove of the Eumenides.\r\n\r\n                               *****\r\n\r\n                          OEDIPUS AT COLONUS\r\n\r\nEnter the blind OEDIPUS led by his daughter, ANTIGONE.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nChild of an old blind sire, Antigone,\r\nWhat region, say, whose city have we reached?\r\nWho will provide today with scanted dole\r\nThis wanderer?

The one\r\nSince first she grew from girlish feebleness\r\nTo womanhood has been the old man's guide\r\nAnd shared my weary wandering, roaming oft\r\nHungry and footsore through wild forest ways,\r\nIn drenching rains and under scorching suns,\r\nCareless herself of home and ease, if so\r\nHer sire might have her tender ministry.\r\nAnd thou, my child, whilom thou wentest forth,\r\nEluding the Cadmeians' vigilance,\r\nTo bring thy father all the oracles\r\nConcerning Oedipus, and didst make thyself\r\nMy faithful lieger, when they banished me.\r\nAnd now what mission summons thee from home,\r\nWhat news, Ismene, hast thou for thy father?\r\nThis much I know, thou com'st not empty-handed,\r\nWithout a warning of some new alarm.\r\n\r\nISMENE\r\nThe toil and trouble, father, that I bore\r\nTo find thy lodging-place and how thou faredst,\r\nI spare thee; surely 'twere a double pain\r\nTo suffer, first in act and then in telling;\r\n'Tis the misfortune of thine ill-starred sons\r\nI come to tell thee.  At the first they willed\r\nTo leave the throne to Creon, minded well\r\nThus to remove the inveterate curse of old,\r\nA canker that infected all thy race.\r\nBut now some god and an infatuate soul\r\nHave stirred betwixt them a mad rivalry\r\nTo grasp at sovereignty and kingly power.\r\nToday the hot-branded youth, the younger born,\r\nIs keeping Polyneices from the throne,\r\nHis elder, and has thrust him from the land.\r\nThe banished brother (so all Thebes reports)\r\nFled to the vale of Argos, and by help\r\nOf new alliance there and friends in arms,\r\nSwears he will stablish Argos straight as lord\r\nOf the Cadmeian land, or, if he fail,\r\nExalt the victor to the stars of heaven.\r\nThis is no empty tale, but deadly truth,\r\nMy father; and how long thy agony,\r\nEre the gods pity thee, I cannot tell.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nHast thou indeed then entertained a hope\r\nThe gods at last will turn and rescue me?\r\n\r\nISMENE\r\nYea, so I read these latest oracles.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nWhat oracles?

Have not I more skill\r\nThan thou to draw the horoscope of Thebes?\r\nAre not my teachers surer guides than thine--\r\nGreat Phoebus and the sire of Phoebus, Zeus?\r\nThou art a messenger suborned, thy tongue\r\nIs sharper than a sword's edge, yet thy speech\r\nWill bring thee more defeats than victories.\r\nHowbeit, I know I waste my words--begone,\r\nAnd leave me here; whate'er may be my lot,\r\nHe lives not ill who lives withal content.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nWhich loses in this parley, I o'erthrown\r\nBy thee, or thou who overthrow'st thyself?\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nI shall be well contented if thy suit\r\nFails with these strangers, as it has with me.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nUnhappy man, will years ne'er make thee wise?\r\nMust thou live on to cast a slur on age?\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nThou hast a glib tongue, but no honest man,\r\nMethinks, can argue well on any side.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\n'Tis one thing to speak much, another well.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nThy words, forsooth, are few and all well aimed!\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nNot for a man indeed with wits like thine.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nDepart!

What is forward? wherefore was I called away\r\nFrom the altar of Poseidon, lord of your Colonus?  Say!\r\nOn what errand have I hurried hither without stop or stay.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nDear friend--those accents tell me who thou art--\r\nYon man but now hath done me a foul wrong.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS\r\nWhat is this wrong and who hath wrought it?  Speak.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nCreon who stands before thee.  He it is\r\nHath robbed me of my all, my daughters twain.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS\r\nWhat means this?\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\n               Thou hast heard my tale of wrongs.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS\r\nHo! hasten to the altars, one of you.\r\nCommand my liegemen leave the sacrifice\r\nAnd hurry, foot and horse, with rein unchecked,\r\nTo where the paths that packmen use diverge,\r\nLest the two maidens slip away, and I\r\nBecome a mockery to this my guest,\r\nAs one despoiled by force.  Quick, as I bid.\r\nAs for this stranger, had I let my rage,\r\nJustly provoked, have play, he had not 'scaped\r\nScathless and uncorrected at my hands.\r\nBut now the laws to which himself appealed,\r\nThese and none others shall adjudicate.\r\nThou shalt not quit this land, till thou hast fetched\r\nThe maidens and produced them in my sight.\r\nThou hast offended both against myself\r\nAnd thine own race and country.  Having come\r\nUnto a State that champions right and asks\r\nFor every action warranty of law,\r\nThou hast set aside the custom of the land,\r\nAnd like some freebooter art carrying off\r\nWhat plunder pleases thee, as if forsooth\r\nThou thoughtest this a city without men,\r\nOr manned by slaves, and me a thing of naught.\r\nYet not from Thebes this villainy was learnt;\r\nThebes is not wont to breed unrighteous sons,\r\nNor would she praise thee, if she learnt that thou\r\nWert robbing me--aye and the gods to boot,\r\nHaling by force their suppliants, poor maids.\r\nWere I on Theban soil, to prosecute\r\nThe justest claim imaginable, I\r\nWould never wrest by violence my own\r\nWithout sanction of your State or King;\r\nI should behave as fits an outlander\r\nLiving amongst a foreign folk, but thou\r\nShamest a city that deserves it not,\r\nEven thine own, and plentitude of years\r\nHave made of thee an old man and a fool.\r\nTherefore again I charge thee as before,\r\nSee that the maidens are restored at once,\r\nUnless thou would'st continue here by force\r\nAnd not by choice a sojourner; so much\r\nI tell thee home and what I say, I mean.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nThy case is perilous; though by birth and race\r\nThou should'st be just, thou plainly doest wrong.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nNot deeming this city void of men\r\nOr counsel, son of Aegeus, as thou say'st\r\nI did what I have done; rather I thought\r\nYour people were not like to set such store\r\nby kin of mine and keep them 'gainst my will.\r\nNor would they harbor, so I stood assured,\r\nA godless parricide, a reprobate\r\nConvicted of incestuous marriage ties.\r\nFor on her native hill of Ares here\r\n(I knew your far-famed Areopagus)\r\nSits Justice, and permits not vagrant folk\r\nTo stay within your borders.  In that faith\r\nI hunted down my quarry; and e'en then\r\nI had refrained but for the curses dire\r\nWherewith he banned my kinsfolk and myself:\r\nSuch wrong, methought, had warrant for my act.\r\nAnger has no old age but only death;\r\nThe dead alone can feel no touch of spite.\r\nSo thou must work thy will; my cause is just\r\nBut weak without allies; yet will I try,\r\nOld as I am, to answer deeds with deeds.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nO shameless railer, think'st thou this abuse\r\nDefames my grey hairs rather than thine own?\r\nMurder and incest, deeds of horror, all\r\nThou blurtest forth against me, all I have borne,\r\nNo willing sinner; so it pleased the gods\r\nWrath haply with my sinful race of old,\r\nSince thou could'st find no sin in me myself\r\nFor which in retribution I was doomed\r\nTo trespass thus against myself and mine.\r\nAnswer me now, if by some oracle\r\nMy sire was destined to a bloody end\r\nBy a son's hand, can this reflect on me,\r\nMe then unborn, begotten by no sire,\r\nConceived in no mother's womb?  And if\r\nWhen born to misery, as born I was,\r\nI met my sire, not knowing whom I met\r\nor what I did, and slew him, how canst thou\r\nWith justice blame the all-unconscious hand?\r\nAnd for my mother, wretch, art not ashamed,\r\nSeeing she was thy sister, to extort\r\nFrom me the story of her marriage, such\r\nA marriage as I straightway will proclaim.\r\nFor I will speak; thy lewd and impious speech\r\nHas broken all the bonds of reticence.\r\nShe was, ah woe is me! she was my mother;\r\nI knew it not, nor she; and she my mother\r\nBare children to the son whom she had borne,\r\nA birth of shame.  But this at least I know\r\nWittingly thou aspersest her and me;\r\nBut I unwitting wed, unwilling speak.\r\nNay neither in this marriage or this deed\r\nWhich thou art ever casting in my teeth--\r\nA murdered sire--shall I be held to blame.\r\nCome, answer me one question, if thou canst:\r\nIf one should presently attempt thy life,\r\nWould'st thou, O man of justice, first inquire\r\nIf the assassin was perchance thy sire,\r\nOr turn upon him?  As thou lov'st thy life,\r\nOn thy aggressor thou would'st turn, no stay\r\nDebating, if the law would bear thee out.\r\nSuch was my case, and such the pass whereto\r\nThe gods reduced me; and methinks my sire,\r\nCould he come back to life, would not dissent.\r\nYet thou, for just thou art not, but a man\r\nWho sticks at nothing, if it serve his plea,\r\nReproachest me with this before these men.\r\nIt serves thy turn to laud great Theseus' name,\r\nAnd Athens as a wisely governed State;\r\nYet in thy flatteries one thing is to seek:\r\nIf any land knows how to pay the gods\r\nTheir proper rites, 'tis Athens most of all.\r\nThis is the land whence thou wast fain to steal\r\nTheir aged suppliant and hast carried off\r\nMy daughters.  Therefore to yon goddesses,\r\nI turn, adjure them and invoke their aid\r\nTo champion my cause, that thou mayest learn\r\nWhat is the breed of men who guard this State.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nAn honest man, my liege, one sore bestead\r\nBy fortune, and so worthy our support.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS\r\nEnough of words; the captors speed amain,\r\nWhile we the victims stand debating here.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nWhat would'st thou?  What can I, a feeble man?\r\n\r\nTHESEUS\r\nShow us the trail, and I'll attend thee too,\r\nThat, if thou hast the maidens hereabouts,\r\nThou mayest thyself discover them to me;\r\nBut if thy guards outstrip us with their spoil,\r\nWe may draw rein; for others speed, from whom\r\nThey will not 'scape to thank the gods at home.\r\nLead on, I say, the captor's caught, and fate\r\nHath ta'en the fowler in the toils he spread;\r\nSo soon are lost gains gotten by deceit.\r\nAnd look not for allies; I know indeed\r\nSuch height of insolence was never reached\r\nWithout abettors or accomplices;\r\nThou hast some backer in thy bold essay,\r\nBut I will search this matter home and see\r\nOne man doth not prevail against the State.\r\nDost take my drift, or seem these words as vain\r\nAs seemed our warnings when the plot was hatched?\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nNothing thou sayest can I here dispute,\r\nBut once at home I too shall act my part.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS\r\nThreaten us and--begone!  Thou, Oedipus,\r\nStay here assured that nothing save my death\r\nWill stay my purpose to restore the maids.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nHeaven bless thee, Theseus, for thy nobleness\r\nAnd all thy loving care in my behalf.\r\n[Exeunt THESEUS and CREON]\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\n(Str. 1)\r\n          O when the flying foe,\r\n          Turning at last to bay,\r\n          Soon will give blow for blow,\r\n          Might I behold the fray;\r\n          Hear the loud battle roar\r\n          Swell, on the Pythian shore,\r\n          Or by the torch-lit bay,\r\n          Where the dread Queen and Maid\r\n          Cherish the mystic rites,\r\n          Rites they to none betray,\r\n          Ere on his lips is laid\r\n          Secrecy's golden key\r\n          By their own acolytes,\r\n          Priestly Eumolpidae.\r\n\r\n          There I might chance behold\r\n          Theseus our captain bold\r\n          Meet with the robber band,\r\n          Ere they have fled the land,\r\n          Rescue by might and main\r\n          Maidens, the captives twain.\r\n\r\n(Ant. 1)\r\n          Haply on swiftest steed,\r\n          Or in the flying car,\r\n          Now they approach the glen,\r\n          West of white Oea's scaur.\r\n          They will be vanquished:\r\n          Dread are our warriors, dread\r\n          Theseus our chieftain's men.\r\n          Flashes each bridle bright,\r\n          Charges each gallant knight,\r\n          All that our Queen adore,\r\n          Pallas their patron, or\r\n          Him whose wide floods enring\r\n          Earth, the great Ocean-king\r\n          Whom Rhea bore.\r\n\r\n(Str. 2)\r\n          Fight they or now prepare\r\n          To fight? a vision rare\r\n          Tells me that soon again\r\n          I shall behold the twain\r\n          Maidens so ill bestead,\r\n          By their kin buffeted.\r\nToday, today Zeus worketh some great thing\r\n     This day shall victory bring.\r\nO for the wings, the wings of a dove,\r\nTo be borne with the speed of the gale,\r\nUp and still upwards to sail\r\n     And gaze on the fray from the clouds above.\r\n(Ant. 2)\r\nAll-seeing Zeus, O lord of heaven,\r\nTo our guardian host be given\r\nMight triumphant to surprise\r\nFlying foes and win their prize.\r\nHear us, Zeus, and hear us, child\r\nOf Zeus, Athene undefiled,\r\nHear, Apollo, hunter, hear,\r\nHuntress, sister of Apollo,\r\nWho the dappled swift-foot deer\r\nO'er the wooded glade dost follow;\r\nHelp with your two-fold power\r\nAthens in danger's hour!\r\nO wayfarer, thou wilt not have to tax\r\nThe friends who watch for thee with false presage,\r\nFor lo, an escort with the maids draws near.\r\n[Enter ANTIGONE and ISMENE with THESEUS]\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nWhere, where? what sayest thou?\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\n                              O father, father,\r\nWould that some god might grant thee eyes to see\r\nThis best of men who brings us back again.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nMy child! and are ye back indeed!\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\n                                   Yes, saved\r\nBy Theseus and his gallant followers.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nCome to your father's arms, O let me feel\r\nA child's embrace I never hoped for more.\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\nThou askest what is doubly sweet to give.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nWhere are ye then?\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\n                    We come together both.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nMy precious nurslings!\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\n                         Fathers aye were fond.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nProps of my age!\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\n               So sorrow sorrow props.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nI have my darlings, and if death should come,\r\nDeath were not wholly bitter with you near.\r\nCling to me, press me close on either side,\r\nThere rest ye from your dreary wayfaring.\r\nNow tell me of your ventures, but in brief;\r\nBrief speech suffices for young maids like you.\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\nHere is our savior; thou should'st hear the tale\r\nFrom his own lips; so shall my part be brief.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nI pray thee do not wonder if the sight\r\nOf children, given o'er for lost, has made\r\nMy converse somewhat long and tedious.\r\nFull well I know the joy I have of them\r\nIs due to thee, to thee and no man else;\r\nThou wast their sole deliverer, none else.\r\nThe gods deal with thee after my desire,\r\nWith thee and with this land! for fear of heaven\r\nI found above all peoples most with you,\r\nAnd righteousness and lips that cannot lie.\r\nI speak in gratitude of what I know,\r\nFor all I have I owe to thee alone.\r\nGive me thy hand, O Prince, that I may touch it,\r\nAnd if thou wilt permit me, kiss thy cheek.\r\nWhat say I?

makes a mock of thee and me.\r\nI'll scatter with a breath the upstart's might,\r\nAnd bring thee home again and stablish thee,\r\nAnd stablish, having cast him out, myself.\r\nThis will thy goodwill I will undertake,\r\nWithout it I can scare return alive.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nFor the king's sake who sent him, Oedipus,\r\nDismiss him not without a meet reply.\r\n\r\nOEDIPUS\r\nNay, worthy seniors, but for Theseus' sake\r\nWho sent him hither to have word of me.\r\nNever again would he have heard my voice;\r\nBut now he shall obtain this parting grace,\r\nAn answer that will bring him little joy.\r\nO villain, when thou hadst the sovereignty\r\nThat now thy brother holdeth in thy stead,\r\nDidst thou not drive me, thine own father, out,\r\nAn exile, cityless, and make we wear\r\nThis beggar's garb thou weepest to behold,\r\nNow thou art come thyself to my sad plight?\r\nNothing is here for tears; it must be borne\r\nBy _me_ till death, and I shall think of thee\r\nAs of my murderer; thou didst thrust me out;\r\n'Tis thou hast made me conversant with woe,\r\nThrough thee I beg my bread in a strange land;\r\nAnd had not these my daughters tended me\r\nI had been dead for aught of aid from thee.\r\nThey tend me, they preserve me, they are men\r\nNot women in true service to their sire;\r\nBut ye are bastards, and no sons of mine.\r\nTherefore just Heaven hath an eye on thee;\r\nHowbeit not yet with aspect so austere\r\nAs thou shalt soon experience, if indeed\r\nThese banded hosts are moving against Thebes.\r\nThat city thou canst never storm, but first\r\nShall fall, thou and thy brother, blood-imbrued.\r\nSuch curse I lately launched against you twain,\r\nSuch curse I now invoke to fight for me,\r\nThat ye may learn to honor those who bear thee\r\nNor flout a sightless father who begat\r\nDegenerate sons--these maidens did not so.\r\nTherefore my curse is stronger than thy \"throne,\"\r\nThy \"suppliance,\" if by right of laws eterne\r\nPrimeval Justice sits enthroned with Zeus.\r\nBegone, abhorred, disowned, no son of mine,\r\nThou vilest of the vile!

So I pray and call\r\nOn the ancestral gloom of Tartarus\r\nTo snatch thee hence, on these dread goddesses\r\nI call, and Ares who incensed you both\r\nTo mortal enmity.

So having reached the abrupt\r\nEarth-rooted Threshold with its brazen stairs,\r\nHe paused at one of the converging paths,\r\nHard by the rocky basin which records\r\nThe pact of Theseus and Peirithous.\r\nBetwixt that rift and the Thorician rock,\r\nThe hollow pear-tree and the marble tomb,\r\nMidway he sat and loosed his beggar's weeds;\r\nThen calling to his daughters bade them fetch\r\nOf running water, both to wash withal\r\nAnd make libation; so they clomb the steep;\r\nAnd in brief space brought what their father bade,\r\nThen laved and dressed him with observance due.\r\nBut when he had his will in everything,\r\nAnd no desire was left unsatisfied,\r\nIt thundered from the netherworld; the maids\r\nShivered, and crouching at their father's knees\r\nWept, beat their breast and uttered a long wail.\r\nHe, as he heard their sudden bitter cry,\r\nFolded his arms about them both and said,\r\n\"My children, ye will lose your sire today,\r\nFor all of me has perished, and no more\r\nHave ye to bear your long, long ministry;\r\nA heavy load, I know, and yet one word\r\nWipes out all score of tribulations--_love_.\r\nAnd love from me ye had--from no man more;\r\nBut now must live without me all your days.\"\r\nSo clinging to each other sobbed and wept\r\nFather and daughters both, but when at last\r\nTheir mourning had an end and no wail rose,\r\nA moment there was silence; suddenly\r\nA voice that summoned him; with sudden dread\r\nThe hair of all stood up and all were 'mazed;\r\nFor the call came, now loud, now low, and oft.\r\n\"Oedipus, Oedipus, why tarry we?\r\nToo long, too long thy passing is delayed.\"\r\nBut when he heard the summons of the god,\r\nHe prayed that Theseus might be brought, and when\r\nThe Prince came nearer:  \"O my friend,\" he cried,\r\n\"Pledge ye my daughters, giving thy right hand--\r\nAnd, daughters, give him yours--and promise me\r\nThou never wilt forsake them, but do all\r\nThat time and friendship prompt in their behoof.\"\r\nAnd he of his nobility repressed\r\nHis tears and swore to be their constant friend.\r\nThis promise given, Oedipus put forth\r\nBlind hands and laid them on his children, saying,\r\n\"O children, prove your true nobility\r\nAnd hence depart nor seek to witness sights\r\nUnlawful or to hear unlawful words.\r\nNay, go with speed; let none but Theseus stay,\r\nOur ruler, to behold what next shall hap.\"\r\nSo we all heard him speak, and weeping sore\r\nWe companied the maidens on their way.\r\nAfter brief space we looked again, and lo\r\nThe man was gone, evanished from our eyes;\r\nOnly the king we saw with upraised hand\r\nShading his eyes as from some awful sight,\r\nThat no man might endure to look upon.\r\nA moment later, and we saw him bend\r\nIn prayer to Earth and prayer to Heaven at once.\r\nBut by what doom the stranger met his end\r\nNo man save Theseus knoweth.  For there fell\r\nNo fiery bold that reft him in that hour,\r\nNor whirlwind from the sea, but he was taken.\r\nIt was a messenger from heaven, or else\r\nSome gentle, painless cleaving of earth's base;\r\nFor without wailing or disease or pain\r\nHe passed away--and end most marvelous.\r\nAnd if to some my tale seems foolishness\r\nI am content that such could count me fool.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nWhere are the maids and their attendant friends?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER\r\nThey cannot be far off; the approaching sound\r\nOf lamentation tells they come this way.\r\n[Enter ANTIGONE and ISMENE]\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\n(Str. 1)\r\nWoe, woe! on this sad day\r\n     We sisters of one blasted stock\r\n     must bow beneath the shock,\r\nMust weep and weep the curse that lay\r\n     On him our sire, for whom\r\nIn life, a life-long world of care\r\n     'Twas ours to bear,\r\n     In death must face the gloom\r\n     That wraps his tomb.\r\nWhat tongue can tell\r\nThat sight ineffable?\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nWhat mean ye, maidens?\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\n                         All is but surmise.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nIs he then gone?\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\n                    Gone as ye most might wish.\r\nNot in battle or sea storm,\r\nBut reft from sight,\r\nBy hands invisible borne\r\nTo viewless fields of night.\r\nAh me! on us too night has come,\r\nThe night of mourning.

She is caught in the act by Creon's\r\nwatchmen and brought before the king. She justifies her action,\r\nasserting that she was bound to obey the eternal laws of right and wrong\r\nin spite of any human ordinance.

Didst hear and heed,\r\nOr art thou deaf when friends are banned as foes?\r\n\r\nISMENE\r\nTo me, Antigone, no word of friends\r\nHas come, or glad or grievous, since we twain\r\nWere reft of our two brethren in one day\r\nBy double fratricide; and since i' the night\r\nOur Argive leaguers fled, no later news\r\nHas reached me, to inspirit or deject.\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\nI know 'twas so, and therefore summoned thee\r\nBeyond the gates to breathe it in thine ear.\r\n\r\nISMENE\r\nWhat is it?  Some dark secret stirs thy breast.\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\nWhat but the thought of our two brothers dead,\r\nThe one by Creon graced with funeral rites,\r\nThe other disappointed?  Eteocles\r\nHe hath consigned to earth (as fame reports)\r\nWith obsequies that use and wont ordain,\r\nSo gracing him among the dead below.\r\nBut Polyneices, a dishonored corse,\r\n(So by report the royal edict runs)\r\nNo man may bury him or make lament--\r\nMust leave him tombless and unwept, a feast\r\nFor kites to scent afar and swoop upon.\r\nSuch is the edict (if report speak true)\r\nOf Creon, our most noble Creon, aimed\r\nAt thee and me, aye me too; and anon\r\nHe will be here to promulgate, for such\r\nAs have not heard, his mandate; 'tis in sooth\r\nNo passing humor, for the edict says\r\nWhoe'er transgresses shall be stoned to death.\r\nSo stands it with us; now 'tis thine to show\r\nIf thou art worthy of thy blood or base.\r\n\r\nISMENE\r\nBut how, my rash, fond sister, in such case\r\nCan I do anything to make or mar?\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\nSay, wilt thou aid me and abet?

For myself, I call\r\nTo witness Zeus, whose eyes are everywhere,\r\nIf I perceive some mischievous design\r\nTo sap the State, I will not hold my tongue;\r\nNor would I reckon as my private friend\r\nA public foe, well knowing that the State\r\nIs the good ship that holds our fortunes all:\r\nFarewell to friendship, if she suffers wreck.\r\nSuch is the policy by which I seek\r\nTo serve the Commons and conformably\r\nI have proclaimed an edict as concerns\r\nThe sons of Oedipus; Eteocles\r\nWho in his country's battle fought and fell,\r\nThe foremost champion--duly bury him\r\nWith all observances and ceremonies\r\nThat are the guerdon of the heroic dead.\r\nBut for the miscreant exile who returned\r\nMinded in flames and ashes to blot out\r\nHis father's city and his father's gods,\r\nAnd glut his vengeance with his kinsmen's blood,\r\nOr drag them captive at his chariot wheels--\r\nFor Polyneices 'tis ordained that none\r\nShall give him burial or make mourn for him,\r\nBut leave his corpse unburied, to be meat\r\nFor dogs and carrion crows, a ghastly sight.\r\nSo am I purposed; never by my will\r\nShall miscreants take precedence of true men,\r\nBut all good patriots, alive or dead,\r\nShall be by me preferred and honored.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nSon of Menoeceus, thus thou will'st to deal\r\nWith him who loathed and him who loved our State.\r\nThy word is law; thou canst dispose of us\r\nThe living, as thou will'st, as of the dead.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nSee then ye execute what I ordain.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nOn younger shoulders lay this grievous charge.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nFear not, I've posted guards to watch the corpse.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nWhat further duty would'st thou lay on us?\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nNot to connive at disobedience.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nNo man is mad enough to court his death.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nThe penalty _is_ death:  yet hope of gain\r\nHath lured men to their ruin oftentimes.\r\n[Enter GUARD]\r\n\r\nGUARD\r\nMy lord, I will not make pretense to pant\r\nAnd puff as some light-footed messenger.\r\nIn sooth my soul beneath its pack of thought\r\nMade many a halt and turned and turned again;\r\nFor conscience plied her spur and curb by turns.\r\n\"Why hurry headlong to thy fate, poor fool?\"\r\nShe whispered.  Then again, \"If Creon learn\r\nThis from another, thou wilt rue it worse.\"\r\nThus leisurely I hastened on my road;\r\nMuch thought extends a furlong to a league.\r\nBut in the end the forward voice prevailed,\r\nTo face thee.  I will speak though I say nothing.\r\nFor plucking courage from despair methought,\r\n'Let the worst hap, thou canst but meet thy fate.'\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nWhat is thy news?  Why this despondency?\r\n\r\nGUARD\r\nLet me premise a word about myself?\r\nI neither did the deed nor saw it done,\r\nNor were it just that I should come to harm.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nThou art good at parry, and canst fence about\r\nSome matter of grave import, as is plain.\r\n\r\nGUARD\r\nThe bearer of dread tidings needs must quake.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nThen, sirrah, shoot thy bolt and get thee gone.\r\n\r\nGUARD\r\nWell, it must out; the corpse is buried; someone\r\nE'en now besprinkled it with thirsty dust,\r\nPerformed the proper ritual--and was gone.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nWhat say'st thou?  Who hath dared to do this thing?\r\n\r\nGUARD\r\nI cannot tell, for there was ne'er a trace\r\nOf pick or mattock--hard unbroken ground,\r\nWithout a scratch or rut of chariot wheels,\r\nNo sign that human hands had been at work.\r\nWhen the first sentry of the morning watch\r\nGave the alarm, we all were terror-stricken.\r\nThe corpse had vanished, not interred in earth,\r\nBut strewn with dust, as if by one who sought\r\nTo avert the curse that haunts the unburied dead:\r\nOf hound or ravening jackal, not a sign.\r\nThereat arose an angry war of words;\r\nGuard railed at guard and blows were like to end it,\r\nFor none was there to part us, each in turn\r\nSuspected, but the guilt brought home to none,\r\nFrom lack of evidence.  We challenged each\r\nThe ordeal, or to handle red-hot iron,\r\nOr pass through fire, affirming on our oath\r\nOur innocence--we neither did the deed\r\nOurselves, nor know who did or compassed it.\r\nOur quest was at a standstill, when one spake\r\nAnd bowed us all to earth like quivering reeds,\r\nFor there was no gainsaying him nor way\r\nTo escape perdition:  _Ye_are_bound_to_tell_\r\n_The_King,_ye_cannot_hide_it; so he spake.\r\nAnd he convinced us all; so lots were cast,\r\nAnd I, unlucky scapegoat, drew the prize.\r\nSo here I am unwilling and withal\r\nUnwelcome; no man cares to hear ill news.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nI had misgivings from the first, my liege,\r\nOf something more than natural at work.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nO cease, you vex me with your babblement;\r\nI am like to think you dote in your old age.\r\nIs it not arrant folly to pretend\r\nThat gods would have a thought for this dead man?\r\nDid they forsooth award him special grace,\r\nAnd as some benefactor bury him,\r\nWho came to fire their hallowed sanctuaries,\r\nTo sack their shrines, to desolate their land,\r\nAnd scout their ordinances?  Or perchance\r\nThe gods bestow their favors on the bad.\r\nNo! no! I have long noted malcontents\r\nWho wagged their heads, and kicked against the yoke,\r\nMisliking these my orders, and my rule.\r\n'Tis they, I warrant, who suborned my guards\r\nBy bribes.  Of evils current upon earth\r\nThe worst is money.  Money 'tis that sacks\r\nCities, and drives men forth from hearth and home;\r\nWarps and seduces native innocence,\r\nAnd breeds a habit of dishonesty.\r\nBut they who sold themselves shall find their greed\r\nOut-shot the mark, and rue it soon or late.\r\nYea, as I still revere the dread of Zeus,\r\nBy Zeus I swear, except ye find and bring\r\nBefore my presence here the very man\r\nWho carried out this lawless burial,\r\nDeath for your punishment shall not suffice.\r\nHanged on a cross, alive ye first shall make\r\nConfession of this outrage.  This will teach you\r\nWhat practices are like to serve your turn.\r\nThere are some villainies that bring no gain.\r\nFor by dishonesty the few may thrive,\r\nThe many come to ruin and disgrace.\r\n\r\nGUARD\r\nMay I not speak, or must I turn and go\r\nWithout a word?--\r\n\r\nCREON\r\n                    Begone! canst thou not see\r\nThat e'en this question irks me?\r\n\r\nGUARD\r\n                                   Where, my lord?\r\nIs it thy ears that suffer, or thy heart?\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nWhy seek to probe and find the seat of pain?\r\n\r\nGUARD\r\nI gall thine ears--this miscreant thy mind.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nWhat an inveterate babbler! get thee gone!\r\n\r\nGUARD\r\nBabbler perchance, but innocent of the crime.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nTwice guilty, having sold thy soul for gain.\r\n\r\nGUARD\r\nAlas! how sad when reasoners reason wrong.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nGo, quibble with thy reason.  If thou fail'st\r\nTo find these malefactors, thou shalt own\r\nThe wages of ill-gotten gains is death.\r\n[Exit CREON]\r\n\r\nGUARD\r\nI pray he may be found.  But caught or not\r\n(And fortune must determine that) thou never\r\nShalt see me here returning; that is sure.\r\nFor past all hope or thought I have escaped,\r\nAnd for my safety owe the gods much thanks.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\n(Str. 1)\r\nMany wonders there be, but naught more wondrous than man;\r\nOver the surging sea, with a whitening south wind wan,\r\nThrough the foam of the firth, man makes his perilous way;\r\nAnd the eldest of deities Earth that knows not toil nor decay\r\nEver he furrows and scores, as his team, year in year out,\r\nWith breed of the yoked horse, the ploughshare turneth about.\r\n\r\n(Ant. 1)\r\nThe light-witted birds of the air, the beasts of the weald and the wood\r\nHe traps with his woven snare, and the brood of the briny flood.\r\nMaster of cunning he:  the savage bull, and the hart\r\nWho roams the mountain free, are tamed by his infinite art;\r\nAnd the shaggy rough-maned steed is broken to bear the bit.\r\n\r\n(Str. 2)\r\nSpeech and the wind-swift speed of counsel and civic wit,\r\nHe hath learnt for himself all these; and the arrowy rain to fly\r\nAnd the nipping airs that freeze, 'neath the open winter sky.\r\nHe hath provision for all: fell plague he hath learnt to endure;\r\nSafe whate'er may befall: yet for death he hath found no cure.\r\n\r\n(Ant. 2)\r\nPassing the wildest flight thought are the cunning and skill,\r\nThat guide man now to the light, but now to counsels of ill.\r\nIf he honors the laws of the land, and reveres the Gods of the State\r\nProudly his city shall stand; but a cityless outcast I rate\r\nWhoso bold in his pride from the path of right doth depart;\r\nNe'er may I sit by his side, or share the thoughts of his heart.\r\n\r\n          What strange vision meets my eyes,\r\n          Fills me with a wild surprise?\r\n          Sure I know her, sure 'tis she,\r\n          The maid Antigone.\r\n          Hapless child of hapless sire,\r\n          Didst thou recklessly conspire,\r\n          Madly brave the King's decree?\r\n          Therefore are they haling thee?\r\n[Enter GUARD bringing ANTIGONE]\r\n\r\nGUARD\r\nHere is the culprit taken in the act\r\nOf giving burial.  But where's the King?\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nThere from the palace he returns in time.\r\n[Enter CREON]\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nWhy is my presence timely?  What has chanced?\r\n\r\nGUARD\r\nNo man, my lord, should make a vow, for if\r\nHe ever swears he will not do a thing,\r\nHis afterthoughts belie his first resolve.\r\nWhen from the hail-storm of thy threats I fled\r\nI sware thou wouldst not see me here again;\r\nBut the wild rapture of a glad surprise\r\nIntoxicates, and so I'm here forsworn.\r\nAnd here's my prisoner, caught in the very act,\r\nDecking the grave.  No lottery this time;\r\nThis prize is mine by right of treasure-trove.\r\nSo take her, judge her, rack her, if thou wilt.\r\nShe's thine, my liege; but I may rightly claim\r\nHence to depart well quit of all these ills.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nSay, how didst thou arrest the maid, and where?\r\n\r\nGUARD\r\nBurying the man.  There's nothing more to tell.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nHast thou thy wits?  Or know'st thou what thou say'st?\r\n\r\nGUARD\r\nI saw this woman burying the corpse\r\nAgainst thy orders.  Is that clear and plain?\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nBut how was she surprised and caught in the act?\r\n\r\nGUARD\r\nIt happened thus.  No sooner had we come,\r\nDriven from thy presence by those awful threats,\r\nThan straight we swept away all trace of dust,\r\nAnd bared the clammy body.  Then we sat\r\nHigh on the ridge to windward of the stench,\r\nWhile each man kept he fellow alert and rated\r\nRoundly the sluggard if he chanced to nap.\r\nSo all night long we watched, until the sun\r\nStood high in heaven, and his blazing beams\r\nSmote us.  A sudden whirlwind then upraised\r\nA cloud of dust that blotted out the sky,\r\nAnd swept the plain, and stripped the woodlands bare,\r\nAnd shook the firmament.  We closed our eyes\r\nAnd waited till the heaven-sent plague should pass.\r\nAt last it ceased, and lo! there stood this maid.\r\nA piercing cry she uttered, sad and shrill,\r\nAs when the mother bird beholds her nest\r\nRobbed of its nestlings; even so the maid\r\nWailed as she saw the body stripped and bare,\r\nAnd cursed the ruffians who had done this deed.\r\nAnon she gathered handfuls of dry dust,\r\nThen, holding high a well-wrought brazen urn,\r\nThrice on the dead she poured a lustral stream.\r\nWe at the sight swooped down on her and seized\r\nOur quarry.  Undismayed she stood, and when\r\nWe taxed her with the former crime and this,\r\nShe disowned nothing.  I was glad--and grieved;\r\nFor 'tis most sweet to 'scape oneself scot-free,\r\nAnd yet to bring disaster to a friend\r\nIs grievous.  Take it all in all, I deem\r\nA man's first duty is to serve himself.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nSpeak, girl, with head bent low and downcast eyes,\r\nDoes thou plead guilty or deny the deed?\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\nGuilty.  I did it, I deny it not.\r\n\r\nCREON (to GUARD)\r\nSirrah, begone whither thou wilt, and thank\r\nThy luck that thou hast 'scaped a heavy charge.\r\n(To ANTIGONE)\r\nNow answer this plain question, yes or no,\r\nWast thou acquainted with the interdict?\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\nI knew, all knew; how should I fail to know?\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nAnd yet wert bold enough to break the law?\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\nYea, for these laws were not ordained of Zeus,\r\nAnd she who sits enthroned with gods below,\r\nJustice, enacted not these human laws.\r\nNor did I deem that thou, a mortal man,\r\nCould'st by a breath annul and override\r\nThe immutable unwritten laws of Heaven.\r\nThey were not born today nor yesterday;\r\nThey die not; and none knoweth whence they sprang.\r\nI was not like, who feared no mortal's frown,\r\nTo disobey these laws and so provoke\r\nThe wrath of Heaven.  I knew that I must die,\r\nE'en hadst thou not proclaimed it; and if death\r\nIs thereby hastened, I shall count it gain.\r\nFor death is gain to him whose life, like mine,\r\nIs full of misery.  Thus my lot appears\r\nNot sad, but blissful; for had I endured\r\nTo leave my mother's son unburied there,\r\nI should have grieved with reason, but not now.\r\nAnd if in this thou judgest me a fool,\r\nMethinks the judge of folly's not acquit.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nA stubborn daughter of a stubborn sire,\r\nThis ill-starred maiden kicks against the pricks.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nWell, let her know the stubbornest of wills\r\nAre soonest bended, as the hardest iron,\r\nO'er-heated in the fire to brittleness,\r\nFlies soonest into fragments, shivered through.\r\nA snaffle curbs the fieriest steed, and he\r\nWho in subjection lives must needs be meek.\r\nBut this proud girl, in insolence well-schooled,\r\nFirst overstepped the established law, and then--\r\nA second and worse act of insolence--\r\nShe boasts and glories in her wickedness.\r\nNow if she thus can flout authority\r\nUnpunished, I am woman, she the man.\r\nBut though she be my sister's child or nearer\r\nOf kin than all who worship at my hearth,\r\nNor she nor yet her sister shall escape\r\nThe utmost penalty, for both I hold,\r\nAs arch-conspirators, of equal guilt.\r\nBring forth the older; even now I saw her\r\nWithin the palace, frenzied and distraught.\r\nThe workings of the mind discover oft\r\nDark deeds in darkness schemed, before the act.\r\nMore hateful still the miscreant who seeks\r\nWhen caught, to make a virtue of a crime.\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\nWould'st thou do more than slay thy prisoner?\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nNot I, thy life is mine, and that's enough.\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\nWhy dally then?  To me no word of thine\r\nIs pleasant:  God forbid it e'er should please;\r\nNor am I more acceptable to thee.\r\nAnd yet how otherwise had I achieved\r\nA name so glorious as by burying\r\nA brother? so my townsmen all would say,\r\nWhere they not gagged by terror,  Manifold\r\nA king's prerogatives, and not the least\r\nThat all his acts and all his words are law.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nOf all these Thebans none so deems but thou.\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\nThese think as I, but bate their breath to thee.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nHast thou no shame to differ from all these?\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\nTo reverence kith and kin can bring no shame.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nWas his dead foeman not thy kinsman too?\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\nOne mother bare them and the self-same sire.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nWhy cast a slur on one by honoring one?\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\nThe dead man will not bear thee out in this.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nSurely, if good and evil fare alive.\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\nThe slain man was no villain but a brother.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nThe patriot perished by the outlaw's brand.\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\nNathless the realms below these rites require.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nNot that the base should fare as do the brave.\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\nWho knows if this world's crimes are virtues there?\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nNot even death can make a foe a friend.\r\n\r\nANTIGONE\r\nMy nature is for mutual love, not hate.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nDie then, and love the dead if thou must;\r\nNo woman shall be the master while I live.\r\n[Enter ISMENE]\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\n          Lo from out the palace gate,\r\n          Weeping o'er her sister's fate,\r\n          Comes Ismene; see her brow,\r\n          Once serene, beclouded now,\r\n          See her beauteous face o'erspread\r\n          With a flush of angry red.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nWoman, who like a viper unperceived\r\nDidst harbor in my house and drain my blood,\r\nTwo plagues I nurtured blindly, so it proved,\r\nTo sap my throne.

Go, let her, if she will,\r\nAppeal to Zeus the God of Kindred, for\r\nIf thus I nurse rebellion in my house,\r\nShall not I foster mutiny without?\r\nFor whoso rules his household worthily,\r\nWill prove in civic matters no less wise.\r\nBut he who overbears the laws, or thinks\r\nTo overrule his rulers, such as one\r\nI never will allow.  Whome'er the State\r\nAppoints must be obeyed in everything,\r\nBut small and great, just and unjust alike.\r\nI warrant such a one in either case\r\nWould shine, as King or subject; such a man\r\nWould in the storm of battle stand his ground,\r\nA comrade leal and true; but Anarchy--\r\nWhat evils are not wrought by Anarchy!\r\nShe ruins States, and overthrows the home,\r\nShe dissipates and routs the embattled host;\r\nWhile discipline preserves the ordered ranks.\r\nTherefore we must maintain authority\r\nAnd yield to title to a woman's will.\r\nBetter, if needs be, men should cast us out\r\nThan hear it said, a woman proved his match.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nTo me, unless old age have dulled wits,\r\nThy words appear both reasonable and wise.\r\n\r\nHAEMON\r\nFather, the gods implant in mortal men\r\nReason, the choicest gift bestowed by heaven.\r\n'Tis not for me to say thou errest, nor\r\nWould I arraign thy wisdom, if I could;\r\nAnd yet wise thoughts may come to other men\r\nAnd, as thy son, it falls to me to mark\r\nThe acts, the words, the comments of the crowd.\r\nThe commons stand in terror of thy frown,\r\nAnd dare not utter aught that might offend,\r\nBut I can overhear their muttered plaints,\r\nKnow how the people mourn this maiden doomed\r\nFor noblest deeds to die the worst of deaths.\r\nWhen her own brother slain in battle lay\r\nUnsepulchered, she suffered not his corse\r\nTo lie for carrion birds and dogs to maul:\r\nShould not her name (they cry) be writ in gold?\r\nSuch the low murmurings that reach my ear.\r\nO father, nothing is by me more prized\r\nThan thy well-being, for what higher good\r\nCan children covet than their sire's fair fame,\r\nAs fathers too take pride in glorious sons?\r\nTherefore, my father, cling not to one mood,\r\nAnd deemed not thou art right, all others wrong.\r\nFor whoso thinks that wisdom dwells with him,\r\nThat he alone can speak or think aright,\r\nSuch oracles are empty breath when tried.\r\nThe wisest man will let himself be swayed\r\nBy others' wisdom and relax in time.\r\nSee how the trees beside a stream in flood\r\nSave, if they yield to force, each spray unharmed,\r\nBut by resisting perish root and branch.\r\nThe mariner who keeps his mainsheet taut,\r\nAnd will not slacken in the gale, is like\r\nTo sail with thwarts reversed, keel uppermost.\r\nRelent then and repent thee of thy wrath;\r\nFor, if one young in years may claim some sense,\r\nI'll say 'tis best of all to be endowed\r\nWith absolute wisdom; but, if that's denied,\r\n(And nature takes not readily that ply)\r\nNext wise is he who lists to sage advice.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nIf he says aught in season, heed him, King.\r\n(To HAEMON)\r\nHeed thou thy sire too; both have spoken well.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nWhat, would you have us at our age be schooled,\r\nLessoned in prudence by a beardless boy?\r\n\r\nHAEMON\r\nI plead for justice, father, nothing more.\r\nWeigh me upon my merit, not my years.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nStrange merit this to sanction lawlessness!\r\n\r\nHAEMON\r\nFor evil-doers I would urge no plea.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nIs not this maid an arrant law-breaker?\r\n\r\nHAEMON\r\nThe Theban commons with one voice say, No.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nWhat, shall the mob dictate my policy?\r\n\r\nHAEMON\r\n'Tis thou, methinks, who speakest like a boy.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nAm I to rule for others, or myself?\r\n\r\nHAEMON\r\nA State for one man is no State at all.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nThe State is his who rules it, so 'tis held.\r\n\r\nHAEMON\r\nAs monarch of a desert thou wouldst shine.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nThis boy, methinks, maintains the woman's cause.\r\n\r\nHAEMON\r\nIf thou be'st woman, yes.

I too will go,\r\nFor all my resolution this way sways.\r\n'Twas I that bound, I too will set her free.\r\nAlmost I am persuaded it is best\r\nTo keep through life the law ordained of old.\r\n[Exit CREON]\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\n(Str. 1)\r\nThou by many names adored,\r\n          Child of Zeus the God of thunder,\r\n          Of a Theban bride the wonder,\r\nFair Italia's guardian lord;\r\n\r\nIn the deep-embosomed glades\r\n          Of the Eleusinian Queen\r\nHaunt of revelers, men and maids,\r\n          Dionysus, thou art seen.\r\n\r\nWhere Ismenus rolls his waters,\r\n          Where the Dragon's teeth were sown,\r\nWhere the Bacchanals thy daughters\r\n          Round thee roam,\r\n          There thy home;\r\nThebes, O Bacchus, is thine own.\r\n\r\n(Ant. 1)\r\nThee on the two-crested rock\r\n          Lurid-flaming torches see;\r\nWhere Corisian maidens flock,\r\n          Thee the springs of Castaly.\r\n\r\nBy Nysa's bastion ivy-clad,\r\nBy shores with clustered vineyards glad,\r\nThere to thee the hymn rings out,\r\nAnd through our streets we Thebans shout,\r\n          All hall to thee\r\n          Evoe, Evoe!\r\n\r\n(Str. 2)\r\nOh, as thou lov'st this city best of all,\r\nTo thee, and to thy Mother levin-stricken,\r\nIn our dire need we call;\r\nThou see'st with what a plague our townsfolk sicken.\r\n          Thy ready help we crave,\r\nWhether adown Parnassian heights descending,\r\nOr o'er the roaring straits thy swift was wending,\r\n          Save us, O save!\r\n\r\n(Ant. 2)\r\nBrightest of all the orbs that breathe forth light,\r\n     Authentic son of Zeus, immortal king,\r\nLeader of all the voices of the night,\r\n     Come, and thy train of Thyiads with thee bring,\r\n          Thy maddened rout\r\nWho dance before thee all night long, and shout,\r\n          Thy handmaids we,\r\n          Evoe, Evoe!\r\n\r\n[Enter MESSENGER]\r\n\r\nMESSENGER\r\nAttend all ye who dwell beside the halls\r\nOf Cadmus and Amphion.  No man's life\r\nAs of one tenor would I praise or blame,\r\nFor Fortune with a constant ebb and rise\r\nCasts down and raises high and low alike,\r\nAnd none can read a mortal's horoscope.\r\nTake Creon; he, methought, if any man,\r\nWas enviable.  He had saved this land\r\nOf Cadmus from our enemies and attained\r\nA monarch's powers and ruled the state supreme,\r\nWhile a right noble issue crowned his bliss.\r\nNow all is gone and wasted, for a life\r\nWithout life's joys I count a living death.\r\nYou'll tell me he has ample store of wealth,\r\nThe pomp and circumstance of kings; but if\r\nThese give no pleasure, all the rest I count\r\nThe shadow of a shade, nor would I weigh\r\nHis wealth and power 'gainst a dram of joy.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nWhat fresh woes bring'st thou to the royal house?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER\r\nBoth dead, and they who live deserve to die.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nWho is the slayer, who the victim? speak.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER\r\nHaemon; his blood shed by no stranger hand.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nWhat mean ye? by his father's or his own?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER\r\nHis own; in anger for his father's crime.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nO prophet, what thou spakest comes to pass.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER\r\nSo stands the case; now 'tis for you to act.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nLo! from the palace gates I see approaching\r\nCreon's unhappy wife, Eurydice.\r\nComes she by chance or learning her son's fate?\r\n[Enter EURYDICE]\r\n\r\nEURYDICE\r\nYe men of Thebes, I overheard your talk.\r\nAs I passed out to offer up my prayer\r\nTo Pallas, and was drawing back the bar\r\nTo open wide the door, upon my ears\r\nThere broke a wail that told of household woe\r\nStricken with terror in my handmaids' arms\r\nI fell and fainted.  But repeat your tale\r\nTo one not unacquaint with misery.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER\r\nDear mistress, I was there and will relate\r\nThe perfect truth, omitting not one word.\r\nWhy should we gloze and flatter, to be proved\r\nLiars hereafter?  Truth is ever best.\r\nWell, in attendance on my liege, your lord,\r\nI crossed the plain to its utmost margin, where\r\nThe corse of Polyneices, gnawn and mauled,\r\nWas lying yet.  We offered first a prayer\r\nTo Pluto and the goddess of cross-ways,\r\nWith contrite hearts, to deprecate their ire.\r\nThen laved with lustral waves the mangled corse,\r\nLaid it on fresh-lopped branches, lit a pyre,\r\nAnd to his memory piled a mighty mound\r\nOf mother earth.  Then to the caverned rock,\r\nThe bridal chamber of the maid and Death,\r\nWe sped, about to enter.  But a guard\r\nHeard from that godless shrine a far shrill wail,\r\nAnd ran back to our lord to tell the news.\r\nBut as he nearer drew a hollow sound\r\nOf lamentation to the King was borne.\r\nHe groaned and uttered then this bitter plaint:\r\n\"Am I a prophet? miserable me!\r\nIs this the saddest path I ever trod?\r\n'Tis my son's voice that calls me.  On press on,\r\nMy henchmen, haste with double speed to the tomb\r\nWhere rocks down-torn have made a gap, look in\r\nAnd tell me if in truth I recognize\r\nThe voice of Haemon or am heaven-deceived.\"\r\nSo at the bidding of our distraught lord\r\nWe looked, and in the craven's vaulted gloom\r\nI saw the maiden lying strangled there,\r\nA noose of linen twined about her neck;\r\nAnd hard beside her, clasping her cold form,\r\nHer lover lay bewailing his dead bride\r\nDeath-wedded, and his father's cruelty.\r\nWhen the King saw him, with a terrible groan\r\nHe moved towards him, crying, \"O my son\r\nWhat hast thou done?  What ailed thee?  What mischance\r\nHas reft thee of thy reason?  O come forth,\r\nCome forth, my son; thy father supplicates.\"\r\nBut the son glared at him with tiger eyes,\r\nSpat in his face, and then, without a word,\r\nDrew his two-hilted sword and smote, but missed\r\nHis father flying backwards.  Then the boy,\r\nWroth with himself, poor wretch, incontinent\r\nFell on his sword and drove it through his side\r\nHome, but yet breathing clasped in his lax arms\r\nThe maid, her pallid cheek incarnadined\r\nWith his expiring gasps.  So there they lay\r\nTwo corpses, one in death.  His marriage rites\r\nAre consummated in the halls of Death:\r\nA witness that of ills whate'er befall\r\nMortals' unwisdom is the worst of all.\r\n[Exit EURYDICE]\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nWhat makest thou of this?  The Queen has gone\r\nWithout a word importing good or ill.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER\r\nI marvel too, but entertain good hope.\r\n'Tis that she shrinks in public to lament\r\nHer son's sad ending, and in privacy\r\nWould with her maidens mourn a private loss.\r\nTrust me, she is discreet and will not err.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nI know not, but strained silence, so I deem,\r\nIs no less ominous than excessive grief.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER\r\nWell, let us to the house and solve our doubts,\r\nWhether the tumult of her heart conceals\r\nSome fell design.  It may be thou art right:\r\nUnnatural silence signifies no good.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\n          Lo! the King himself appears.\r\n          Evidence he with him bears\r\n          'Gainst himself (ah me! I quake\r\n          'Gainst a king such charge to make)\r\n          But all must own,\r\n          The guilt is his and his alone.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\n(Str. 1)\r\n          Woe for sin of minds perverse,\r\n          Deadly fraught with mortal curse.\r\n          Behold us slain and slayers, all akin.\r\n          Woe for my counsel dire, conceived in sin.\r\n               Alas, my son,\r\n               Life scarce begun,\r\n               Thou wast undone.\r\n          The fault was mine, mine only, O my son!\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nToo late thou seemest to perceive the truth.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\n(Str. 2)\r\nBy sorrow schooled.  Heavy the hand of God,\r\nThorny and rough the paths my feet have trod,\r\nHumbled my pride, my pleasure turned to pain;\r\nPoor mortals, how we labor all in vain!\r\n[Enter SECOND MESSENGER]\r\n\r\nSECOND MESSENGER\r\nSorrows are thine, my lord, and more to come,\r\nOne lying at thy feet, another yet\r\nMore grievous waits thee, when thou comest home.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nWhat woe is lacking to my tale of woes?\r\n\r\nSECOND MESSENGER\r\nThy wife, the mother of thy dead son here,\r\nLies stricken by a fresh inflicted blow.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\n(Ant. 1)\r\n     How bottomless the pit!\r\n          Does claim me too, O Death?\r\n          What is this word he saith,\r\n     This woeful messenger?  Say, is it fit\r\n     To slay anew a man already slain?\r\n          Is Death at work again,\r\n     Stroke upon stroke, first son, then mother slain?\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\nLook for thyself.  She lies for all to view.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\n(Ant. 2)\r\nAlas! another added woe I see.\r\nWhat more remains to crown my agony?\r\nA minute past I clasped a lifeless son,\r\nAnd now another victim Death hath won.\r\nUnhappy mother, most unhappy son!\r\n\r\nSECOND MESSENGER\r\nBeside the altar on a keen-edged sword\r\nShe fell and closed her eyes in night, but erst\r\nShe mourned for Megareus who nobly died\r\nLong since, then for her son; with her last breath\r\nShe cursed thee, the slayer of her child.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\n(Str. 3)\r\n          I shudder with affright\r\nO for a two-edged sword to slay outright\r\n          A wretch like me,\r\n          Made one with misery.\r\n\r\nSECOND MESSENGER\r\n'Tis true that thou wert charged by the dead Queen\r\nAs author of both deaths, hers and her son's.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\nIn what wise was her self-destruction wrought?\r\n\r\nSECOND MESSENGER\r\nHearing the loud lament above her son\r\nWith her own hand she stabbed herself to the heart.\r\n\r\nCREON\r\n(Str. 4)\r\nI am the guilty cause.
