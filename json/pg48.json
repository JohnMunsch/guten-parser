Economic considerations, however, have played second fiddle to\r\n    political and military upheavals during more than 13 years of war, including\r\n    the nearly 10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended 15 February\r\n    1989). Over the past decade, one-third of the population fled the country,\r\n    with Pakistan sheltering more than 3 million refugees and Iran about 1.3\r\n    million. Another 1 million probably moved into and around urban areas within\r\n    Afghanistan.

For over\r\n    40 years, the Stalinist-type economy has operated on the principle of\r\n    central planning and state ownership of the means of production. Albania\r\n    began fitful economic reforms during 1991, including the liberalization of\r\n    prices and trade, the privatization of shops and transport, and land reform.\r\n    These reform measures were crippled, however, by the widespread civil\r\n    disorder that accompanied the collapse of the Communist state. Following\r\n    their overwhelming victory in the 22 March 1991 elections, the new\r\n    Democratic government announced a program of shock therapy to stabilize the\r\n    economy and establish a market economy. In an effort to expand international\r\n    ties, Tirane has reestablished diplomatic relations with the former Soviet\r\n    Union and the US and has joined the IMF and World Bank. The Albanians have\r\n    also passed legislation allowing foreign investment. Albania possesses\r\n    considerable mineral resources and, until 1990, was largely self-sufficient\r\n    in food; however, the breakup of cooperative farms in 1991 and general\r\n    economic decline forced Albania to rely on foreign aid to maintain adequate\r\n    supplies. Available statistics on Albanian economic activity are rudimentary\r\n    and subject to an especially wide margin of error.\r\nGNP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $2.7 billion, per capita $820;

Algeria\r\n    depends on hydrocarbons for nearly all of its export receipts, about 30% of\r\n    government revenues, and nearly 25% of GDP. In 1973-74 the sharp increase in\r\n    oil prices led to a booming economy and helped to finance an ambitious\r\n    program of industrialization. Plunging oil and gas prices, combined with the\r\n    mismanagement of Algeria's highly centralized economy, has brought the\r\n    nation to its most serious social and economic crisis since independence in\r\n    1988. The government has promised far-reaching reforms, including\r\n    privatization of some public- sector companies, encouraging private-sector\r\n    activity, boosting gas and nonhydrocarbon exports, and proposing a major\r\n    overhaul of the banking and financial systems, but to date it has made only\r\n    limited progress.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $54 billion, per capita $2,130;

An estimated 13 million\r\n    tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its\r\n    summer and winter resorts. Agricultural production is limited by a scarcity\r\n    of arable land, and most food has to be imported. The principal livestock\r\n    activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes,\r\n    cigars, and furniture. The rapid pace of European economic integration is a\r\n    potential threat to Andorra's advantages from its duty-free status.\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $727 million, per capita $14,000;

Oil production is vital\r\n    to the economy, contributing about 60% to GDP. In recent years, a bitter\r\n    internal war has severely affected the nonoil economy, and food has to be\r\n    imported. For the long run, Angola has the advantage of rich natural\r\n    resources in addition to oil, notably gold, diamonds, and arable land. To\r\n    realize its economic potential Angola not only must secure domestic peace\r\n    but also must reform government policies that have led to distortions and\r\n    imbalances throughout the economy.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $8.3 billion, per capita $950;

During the period 1987-90, real GDP\r\n    expanded at an annual average rate of about 6%.

In turn, Armenia had depended on supplies of raw materials\r\n    and energy from the other republics. Most of these supplies enter the\r\n    republic by rail through Azerbaijan (85%) and Georgia (15%). The economy has\r\n    been severely hurt by ethnic strife with Azerbaijan over control of the\r\n    Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, a mostly Armenian-populated enclave\r\n    within the national boundaries of Azerbaijan. In addition to outright\r\n    warfare, the strife has included interdiction of Armenian imports on the\r\n    Azerbaijani railroads and expensive airlifts of supplies to beleagured\r\n    Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. An earthquake in December 1988 destroyed\r\n    about one-tenth of industrial capacity and housing, the repair of which has\r\n    not been possible because the supply of funds and real resources has been\r\n    disrupted by the reorganization and subsequent dismantling of the central\r\n    USSR administrative apparatus. Among facilities made unserviceable by the\r\n    earthquake are the Yerevan nuclear power plant, which had supplied 40% of\r\n    Armenia's needs for electric power and a plant that produced one-quarter of\r\n    the output of elevators in the former USSR. Armenia has some deposits of\r\n    nonferrous metal ores (bauxite, copper, zinc, and molybdenum) that are\r\n    largely unexploited. For the mid-term, Armenia's economic prospects seem\r\n    particularly bleak because of ethnic strife and the unusually high\r\n    dependence on outside areas, themselves in a chaotic state of\r\n    transformation.\r\nGDP:\r\n    $NA, per capita $NA;

Thanks\r\n    to an excellent raw material endowment, a technically skilled labor force,\r\n    and strong links to German industrial firms, Austria occupies specialized\r\n    niches in European industry and services (tourism, banking) and produces\r\n    almost enough food to feed itself with only 8% of the labor force in\r\n    agriculture. Improved export prospects resulting from German unification and\r\n    the opening of Eastern Europe, boosted the economy during 1990 and to a\r\n    lesser extent in 1991. GDP growth slowed from 4.9% in 1990 to 3% in 1991 -\r\n    mainly due to the weaker world economy - and is expected to drop to around\r\n    2% in 1992. Inflation is forecasted at about 4%, while unemployment probably\r\n    will increase moderately through 1992 before declining in 1993. Living\r\n    standards are comparable with the large industrial countries of Western\r\n    Europe. Problems for the l990s include an aging population, the high level\r\n    of subsidies, and the struggle to keep welfare benefits within budget\r\n    capabilities. Austria, which has applied for EC membership, was involved in\r\n    EC and European Free Trade Association negotiations for a European Economic\r\n    Area and will have to adapt its economy to achieve freer interchange of\r\n    goods, services, capital, and labor within the EC.\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $164.1 billion, per capita $20,985;

It resembles the Central Asian states in\r\n    its majority Muslim population, high structural unemployment, and low\r\n    standard of living. The economy's most prominent products are cotton, oil,\r\n    and gas. Production from the Caspian oil and gas field has been in decline\r\n    for several years. With foreign assistance, the oil industry might generate\r\n    the funds needed to spur industrial development. However, civil unrest,\r\n    marked by armed conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region between Muslim\r\n    Azeris and Christian Armenians, makes foreign investors wary. Azerbaijan\r\n    accounts for 1.5% to 2% of the capital stock and output of the former Soviet\r\n    Union. Although immediate economic prospects are not favorable because of\r\n    civil strife, lack of economic reform, political disputes about new economic\r\n    arrangements, and the skittishness of foreign investors, Azerbaijan's\r\n    economic performance was the best of all former Soviet republics in 1991\r\n    largely because of its reliance on domestic resources for industrial output.\r\nGDP:\r\n    $NA, per capita $NA;

The economy is based\r\n    on the output of a narrow range of agricultural products, such as jute,\r\n    which is the main cash crop and major source of export earnings, and rice.\r\n    Bangladesh is hampered by a relative lack of natural resources, population\r\n    growth of more than 2% a year, large-scale unemployment, and a limited\r\n    infrastructure; furthermore, it is highly vulnerable to natural disasters.\r\n    Despite these constraints, real GDP growth averaged about 3.5% annually\r\n    during 1985-89. A strong agricultural performance in FY90 pushed the growth\r\n    rate up to 6.2%, and FY91 saw further, though smaller, increases in output.\r\n    Alleviation of poverty remains the cornerstone of the government's\r\n    development strategy.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $23.1 billion, per capita $200;

In recent years, however, the economy has diversified\r\n    into manufacturing and tourism. The tourist industry is now a major employer\r\n    of the labor force and a primary source of foreign exchange. The economy\r\n    slowed in 1990-91, however, and Bridgetown's declining hard currency\r\n    reserves and inability to finance its deficits have caused it to adopt an\r\n    austere economic reform program.\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $1.7 billion, per capita $6,500;

Belarus ranks fourth in gross output among the former Soviet\r\n    republics, producing 4% of the total GDP and employing 4% of the labor\r\n    force. Once a mainly agricultural area, it now supplies important producer\r\n    and consumer goods - sometimes as the sole producer - to the other states.\r\n    The soil in Belarus is not as fertile as the black earth of Ukraine, but by\r\n    emphasizing favorable crops and livestock (especially pigs and chickens),\r\n    Belarus has become a net exporter to the other republics of meat, milk,\r\n    eggs, flour, and potatoes. Belarus produces only small amounts of oil and\r\n    gas and receives most of its fuel from Russia through the Druzhba oil\r\n    pipeline and the Northern Lights gas pipeline. These pipelines transit\r\n    Belarus enroute to Eastern Europe. Belarus produces petrochemicals,\r\n    plastics, synthetic fibers (nearly 30% of former Soviet output), and\r\n    fertilizer (20% of former Soviet output). Raw material resources are limited\r\n    to potash and peat deposits. The peat (more than one-third of the total for\r\n    the former Soviet Union) is used in domestic heating as boiler fuel for\r\n    electric power stations and in the production of chemicals. The potash\r\n    supports fertilizer production.\r\nGDP:\r\n    NA - $NA, per capita $NA; real growth rate --2% (1991)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    81% (1991)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $NA million;

The\r\n    economy is closely aligned with that of India through strong trade and\r\n    monetary links. Low wages in industry lead most Bhutanese to stay in\r\n    agriculture. Most development projects, such as road construction, rely on\r\n    Indian migrant labor. Bhutan's hydropower potential and its attraction for\r\n    tourists are its most important natural resources.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $320 million, per capita $200; real growth rate\r\n    3.1% (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    12% (FY90)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    NA\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $112 million;

An austere orthodox economic\r\n    program adopted by then President Paz Estenssoro in 1985, however, succeeded\r\n    in reducing inflation to between 10% and 20% annually since 1987, eventually\r\n    restarting economic growth. Since August 1989, President Paz Zamora has\r\n    retained the economic policies of the previous government, keeping inflation\r\n    down and continuing moderate growth. Nevertheless, Bolivia continues to be\r\n    one of the poorest countries in Latin America, with widespread poverty and\r\n    unemployment, and it remains vulnerable to price fluctuations for its\r\n    limited exports - agricultural products, minerals, and natural gas.\r\n    Moreover, for many farmers, who constitute half of the country's work force,\r\n    the main cash crop is coca, which is sold for cocaine processing.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $4.6 billion, per capita $630;

Although agriculture has been almost all in\r\n    private hands, farms have been small and inefficient, and the republic\r\n    traditionally has been a net importer of food. Industry has been greatly\r\n    overstaffed, one reflection of the rigidities of Communist central planning\r\n    and management. Tito had pushed the development of military industries in\r\n    the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted a large share of\r\n    Yugoslavia's defense plants. As of April 1992, the newly independent\r\n    republic was being torn apart by bitter interethnic warfare that has caused\r\n    production to plummet, unemployment and inflation to soar, and human misery\r\n    to multiply. The survival of the republic as a political and economic unit\r\n    is in doubt. Both Serbia and Croatia have imposed various economic blockades\r\n    and may permanently take over large areas populated by fellow ethnic groups.\r\n    These areas contain most of the industry. If a much smaller core Muslim\r\n    state survives, it will share many Third World problems of poverty,\r\n    technological backwardness, and dependence on historically soft foreign\r\n    markets for its primary products.

The driving force behind the\r\n    rapid economic growth of the 1970s and 1980s has been the mining industry.\r\n    This sector, mostly on the strength of diamonds, has gone from generating\r\n    25% of GDP in 1980 to over 50% in 1989. No other sector has experienced such\r\n    growth, especially not agriculture, which is plagued by erratic rainfall and\r\n    poor soils. The unemployment rate remains a problem at 25%. Although diamond\r\n    production remained level in FY91, substantial gains in coal output and\r\n    manufacturing helped boost the economy\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $3.6 billion, per capita $2,800; real growth\r\n    rate 6.3% (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    12.6% (1991)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    25% (1989)\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $1,935 million; expenditures $1,885 million, including capital\r\n    expenditures of $658 million (FY93)\r\nExports:\r\n    $1.8 billion (f.o.b. 1990)\r\n  commodities:\r\n    diamonds 80%, copper and nickel 9%, meat 4%, cattle, animal products\r\n  partners:\r\n    Switzerland, UK, SACU (Southern African Customs Union)\r\nImports:\r\n    $1.6 billion (c.i.f., 1990 est.)\r\n  commodities:\r\n    foodstuffs, vehicles and transport equipment, textiles, petroleum products\r\n  partners:\r\n    Switzerland, SACU (Southern African Customs Union), UK, US\r\nExternal debt:\r\n    $780 million (December 1990 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n    growth rate 16.8% (FY86);

In addition,\r\n    the economy remained highly regulated, inward-looking, and protected by\r\n    substantial trade and investment barriers. Ownership of major industrial and\r\n    mining facilities is divided among private interests - including several\r\n    multinationals - and the government. Most large agricultural holdings are\r\n    private, with the government channeling financing to this sector. Conflicts\r\n    between large landholders and landless peasants have produced intermittent\r\n    violence. The Collor government, which assumed office in March 1990, is\r\n    embarked on an ambitious reform program that seeks to modernize and\r\n    reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices, deregulating the economy,\r\n    and opening it to increased foreign competition. The government in December\r\n    1991 signed a letter of intent with the IMF for a 20-month standby loan.\r\n    Having reached an agreement on the repayment of interest arrears accumulated\r\n    during 1989 and 1990, Brazilian officials and commercial bankers are engaged\r\n    in talks on the reduction of medium- and long-term debt and debt service\r\n    payments and on the elimination of remaining interest arrears. A major\r\n    long-run strength is Brazil's vast natural resources.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $358 billion, per capita $2,300; real growth rate\r\n    1.2% (1991)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    478.5% (December 1991, annual rate)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    4.3% (1991)\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $164.3 billion;

By 1990, Sofia's foreign debt had skyrocketed to over $10 billion\r\n    - giving a debt-service ratio of more than 40% of hard currency earnings and\r\n    leading the regime to declare a moratorium on its hard currency payments.\r\n    The post-Communist government faces major problems of renovating an aging\r\n    industrial plant; coping with worsening energy, food, and consumer goods\r\n    shortages; keeping abreast of rapidly unfolding technological developments;\r\n    investing in additional energy capacity (the portion of electric power from\r\n    nuclear energy reached over one-third in 1990); and motivating workers, in\r\n    part by giving them a share in the earnings of their enterprises. Bulgaria's\r\n    new government, led by Prime Minister Filip Dimitrov, is strongly committed\r\n    to economic reform. The previous government, even though dominated by former\r\n    Communists, had taken the first steps toward dismantling the central\r\n    planning system, bringing the economy back into balance, and reducing\r\n    inflationary pressures. The program produced some encouraging early results,\r\n    including eased restrictions on foreign investment, increased support from\r\n    international financial institutions, and liberalized currency trading.\r\n    Small entrepreneurs have begun to emerge and some privatization of small\r\n    enterprises has taken place. The government has passed bills to privatize\r\n    large state-owned enterprises and reform the banking system. Negotiations on\r\n    an association agreement with the EC began in late 1991.\r\nGNP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $36.4 billion, per capita $4,100; real growth\r\n    rate --22% (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    420% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    10% (1991 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues NA;

The\r\n    nation has been unable to achieve any substantial improvement in export\r\n    earnings because of falling prices for many of its major commodity exports.\r\n    For rice, traditionally the most important export, the drop in world prices\r\n    has been accompanied by shrinking markets and a smaller volume of sales. In\r\n    1985 teak replaced rice as the largest export and continues to hold this\r\n    position. The economy is heavily dependent on the agricultural sector, which\r\n    generates about 40% of GDP and provides employment for 65% of the work\r\n    force. Burma has been largely isolated from international economic forces\r\n    and has been trying to encourage foreign investment, so far with little\r\n    success.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $22.2 billion, per capita $530;

Its economic health depends on the coffee crop, which accounts\r\n    for an average 90% of foreign exchange earnings each year. The ability to\r\n    pay for imports therefore continues to rest largely on the vagaries of the\r\n    climate and the international coffee market. As part of its economic reform\r\n    agenda, launched in February 1991 with IMF and World Bank support, Burundi\r\n    is trying to diversify its export agriculture capability and attract foreign\r\n    investment in industry. Several state-owned coffee companies were privatized\r\n    via public auction in September 1991.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $1.13 billion, per capita $200; real growth rate\r\n    3.4% (1990 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    7.1% (1990 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $158 million;

The economy is based on agriculture\r\n    and related industries. Over the past decade Cambodia has been slowly\r\n    recovering from its near destruction by war and political upheaval. The food\r\n    situation remains precarious; during the 1980s famine was averted only\r\n    through international relief. In 1986 the production level of rice, the\r\n    staple food crop, was able to meet only 80% of domestic needs. The biggest\r\n    success of the nation's recovery program has been in new rubber plantings\r\n    and in fishing. Industry, other than rice processing, is almost nonexistent.\r\n    Foreign trade has been primarily with the former USSR and Vietnam, and both\r\n    trade and foreign aid are being adversely affected by the breakup of the\r\n    USSR. Statistical data on the economy continue to be sparse and unreliable.\r\n    Foreign aid from the former USSR and Eastern Europe has virtually stopped.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $930 million, per capita $130;

Still, it faces many of the serious\r\n    problems facing other underdeveloped countries, such as political\r\n    instability, a top-heavy civil service, and a generally unfavorable climate\r\n    for business enterprise. The development of the oil sector led rapid\r\n    economic growth between 1970 and 1985. Growth came to an abrupt halt in 1986\r\n    precipitated by steep declines in the prices of major exports: coffee,\r\n    cocoa, and petroleum. Export earnings were cut by almost one-third, and\r\n    inefficiencies in fiscal management were exposed. In 1990-92, with support\r\n    from the IMF and World Bank, the government has begun to introduce reforms\r\n    designed to spur business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture,\r\n    and recapitalize the nation's banks. Nationwide strikes organized by\r\n    opposition parties in 1991, however, undermined these efforts.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $11.5 billion, per capita $1,040; real growth\r\n    rate 0.7% (1990 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    8.6% (FY88)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    25% (1990 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $1.2 billion;

Since World War II the impressive growth of the manufacturing,\r\n    mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural\r\n    economy into one primarily industrial and urban. In the 1980s, Canada\r\n    registered one of the highest rates of real growth among the OECD nations,\r\n    averaging about 3.2%. With its great natural resources, skilled labor force,\r\n    and modern capital plant, Canada has excellent economic prospects.

The economy is service oriented, with\r\n    commerce, transport, and public services accounting for 65% of GDP during\r\n    the period 1985-88. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in rural\r\n    areas, agriculture's share of GDP is only 16%; the fishing sector accounts\r\n    for 4%. About 90% of food must be imported. The fishing potential, mostly\r\n    lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. In 1988 fishing represented only\r\n    3.5% of GDP. Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by\r\n    remittances from emigrants and foreign aid. Economic reforms launched by the\r\n    new democratic government in February 1991 are aimed at developing the\r\n    private sector and attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $310 million, per capita $800;

Its economy is burdened by the ravages of civil war, conflict\r\n    with Libya, drought, and food shortages. In 1986 real GDP returned to its\r\n    1977 level, with cotton, the major cash crop, accounting for 48% of exports.\r\n    Over 80% of the work force is employed in subsistence farming and fishing.\r\n    Industry is based almost entirely on the processing of agricultural\r\n    products, including cotton, sugarcane, and cattle. Chad is highly dependent\r\n    on foreign aid, with its economy in trouble and many regions suffering from\r\n    shortages.

To this end the authorities have\r\n    switched to a system of household responsibility in agriculture in place of\r\n    the old collectivization, increased the authority of local officials and\r\n    plant managers in industry, permitted a wide variety of small-scale\r\n    enterprise in services and light manufacturing, and opened the foreign\r\n    economic sector to increased trade and joint ventures. The most gratifying\r\n    result has been a strong spurt in production, particularly in agriculture in\r\n    the early 1980s. Industry also has posted major gains, especially in coastal\r\n    areas near Hong Kong and opposite Taiwan, where foreign investment and\r\n    modern production methods have helped spur production of both domestic and\r\n    export goods. Aggregate output has more than doubled since 1978. On the\r\n    darker side, the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid system the\r\n    worst results of socialism (bureaucracy, lassitude, corruption) and of\r\n    capitalism (windfall gains and stepped-up inflation). Beijing thus has\r\n    periodically backtracked, retightening central controls at intervals and\r\n    thereby lessening the credibility of the reform process. In 1991 output rose\r\n    substantially, particularly in the favored coastal areas. Popular\r\n    resistance, changes in central policy, and loss of authority by rural cadres\r\n    have weakened China's population control program, which is essential to the\r\n    nation's long-term economic viability.\r\nGNP:\r\n    $NA, per capita $NA;

Conservative economic policies have\r\n    kept inflation and unemployment near 30% and 10%, respectively. The rapid\r\n    development of oil, coal, and other nontraditional industries over the past\r\n    four years has helped to offset the decline in coffee prices - Colombia's\r\n    major export. The collapse of the International Coffee Agreement in the\r\n    summer of 1989, a troublesome rural insurgency, and drug-related violence\r\n    have dampened growth, but significant economic reforms are likely to\r\n    facilitate a resurgent economy in the medium term. These reforms center on\r\n    fiscal restraint, trade liberalization, and privatization of state utilities\r\n    and commercial banks.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $45 billion, per capita $1,300;

The low educational level of the\r\n    labor force contributes to a low level of economic activity, high\r\n    unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical\r\n    assistance. Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the\r\n    leading sector of the economy. It contributes about 34% to GDP, employs 80%\r\n    of the labor force, and provides most of the exports. The country is not\r\n    self-sufficient in food production, and rice, the main staple, accounts for\r\n    90% of imports. During the period 1982-86 the industrial sector grew at an\r\n    annual average rate of 5.3%, but its contribution to GDP was only 5% in\r\n    1988. Despite major investment in the tourist industry, which accounts for\r\n    about 25% of GDP, growth has stagnated since 1983. A sluggish growth rate of\r\n    1.5% during 1985-90 has led to large budget deficits, declining incomes, and\r\n    balance-of-payments difficulties. Preliminary estimates for 1991 show a\r\n    moderate increase in the growth rate based on increased exports, tourism,\r\n    and government investment outlays.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $260 million, per capita $540;

A reform\r\n    program, supported by the IMF and World Bank, ran into difficulties in\r\n    1990-91 because of problems in changing to a democratic political regime and\r\n    a heavy debt-servicing burden. Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay\r\n    of the economy, providing about two-thirds of government revenues and\r\n    exports. In the early 1980s rapidly rising oil revenues enabled Congo to\r\n    finance large-scale development projects with growth averaging 5% annually,\r\n    one of the highest rates in Africa. During the period 1987-91, however,\r\n    growth has slowed to an average of roughly 1.5% annually, only half the\r\n    population growth rate.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $2.4 billion, per capita $1,070;

The major export earners are fruit,\r\n    copra, and clothing. Manufacturing activities are limited to a\r\n    fruit-processing plant and several clothing factories. Economic development\r\n    is hindered by the isolation of the islands from foreign markets and a lack\r\n    of natural resources and good transportation links.

Serbia and the Serb-dominated army of\r\n    the old Yugoslavia, however, have seized Croatian territory, and the\r\n    overriding determinant of Croatia's long-term economic prospects will be the\r\n    final border settlement. Under the most favorable circumstances, Croatia\r\n    will retain the Dalmatian coast with its major tourist attractions and\r\n    Slavonia with its oilfields and rich agricultural land. Even so, Croatia\r\n    would face monumental problems stemming from: the legacy of longtime\r\n    Communist mismanagement of the economy; large foreign debt; damage during\r\n    the fighting to bridges, factories, powerlines, buildings, and houses; and\r\n    the disruption of economic ties to Serbia and the other former Yugoslav\r\n    republics. At the minimum, extensive Western aid and investment, especially\r\n    in the tourist and oil industries, would seem necessary to salvage a\r\n    desperate economic situation. However, peace and political stability must\r\n    come first.\r\nGDP:\r\n    NA - $26.3 billion, per capita $5,600; real growth rate -25% (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    14.3% (March 1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    20% (December 1991)\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $NA million;

Sugar provided about\r\n    two-thirds of export revenues in 1991, and over half was exported to the\r\n    former Soviet republics. The economy has stagnated since 1985 under policies\r\n    that have deemphasized material incentives in the workplace, abolished\r\n    farmers' informal produce markets, and raised prices of government-supplied\r\n    goods and services. In 1990 the economy probably fell 5% largely as a result\r\n    of declining trade with the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Recently\r\n    the government has been trying to increase trade with Latin America and\r\n    China. Cuba has had difficulty servicing its foreign debt since 1982. The\r\n    government currently is encouraging foreign investment in tourist facilities\r\n    and in industrial plants idled by falling imports from the former Soviet\r\n    Union. Other investment priorities include sugar, basic foods, and nickel.\r\n    The annual Soviet subsidy dropped from $4 billion in 1990 to about $1\r\n    billion in 1991 because of a lower price paid for Cuban sugar and a sharp\r\n    decline in Soviet exports to Cuba. The former Soviet republics have\r\n    indicated they will no longer extend aid to Cuba beginning in 1992. Instead\r\n    of highly subsidized trade, Cuba has been shifting to trade at market prices\r\n    in convertible currencies. Because of increasingly severe shortages of\r\n    fuels, industrial raw materials, and spare parts, aggregate output dropped\r\n    by one-fifth in 1991.\r\nGNP:\r\n    $17 billion, per capita $1,580;

Industry\r\n    contributes 24% to GDP and employs 35% of the labor force, while the service\r\n    sector contributes 44% to GDP and employs 45% of the labor force. Rapid\r\n    growth in exports of agricultural and manufactured products and in tourism\r\n    have played important roles in the average 6.4% rise in GDP between 1985 and\r\n    1990. In mid-1991, the World Bank \"graduated\" Cyprus off its list of\r\n    developing countries. In contrast to the bright picture in the south, the\r\n    Turkish Cypriot economy has less than half the per capita GDP and suffered a\r\n    series of reverses in 1991. Crippled by the effects of the Gulf war, the\r\n    collapse of the fruit-to-electronics conglomerate, Polly Peck, Ltd., and a\r\n    drought, the Turkish area in late 1991 asked for a multibillion-dollar grant\r\n    from Turkey to help ease the burden of the economic crisis.

GDP per capita has been the highest\r\n    in Eastern Europe. Annual GDP growth slowed to less than 1 percent during\r\n    the 1985-90 period. The country is deficient in energy and in many raw\r\n    materials. Moreover, its aging capital plant lags well behind West European\r\n    standards. In January 1991, Prague launched a sweeping program to convert\r\n    its almost entirely state-owned and controlled economy to a market system.\r\n    The koruna now enjoys almost full internal convertibility and over 90% of\r\n    prices are set by the market. The government is planning to privatize all\r\n    small businesses and roughly two-thirds of large enterprises by the end of\r\n    1993. New private-sector activity is also expanding. Agriculture - 95%\r\n    socialized - is to be privatized by the end of 1992. Reform has taken its\r\n    toll on the economy: inflation was roughly 50% in 1991, unemployment was\r\n    nearly 70%, and GDP dropped an estimated 15%. In 1992 the government is\r\n    anticipating inflation of 10-15%, unemployment of 11-12%, and a drop in GDP\r\n    of up to 8%. As of mid-1992, the nation appears to be splitting in two -\r\n    into the industrial Czech area and the more agarian Slovak area.\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $108.9 billion, per capita $6,900;

Denmark probably\r\n    will continue its successful economic recovery in 1992 with tight fiscal and\r\n    monetary policies and export- oriented growth. Prime Minister Schluter's\r\n    main priorities are to maintain a current account surplus in order to pay\r\n    off extensive external debt and to continue to freeze public-sector\r\n    expenditures in order to reduce the budget deficit. The rate of growth by\r\n    1993 - boosted by increased investment and domestic demand - may be\r\n    sufficient to start to cut Denmark's high unemployment rate, which is\r\n    expected to remain at about 11% in 1992. Low inflation, low wage increases,\r\n    and the current account surplus put Denmark in a good competitive position\r\n    for the EC's anticipated single market, although Denmark must cut its VAT\r\n    and income taxes.\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $91.1 billion, per capita $17,700;

It has few natural\r\n    resources and little industry. The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent\r\n    on foreign assistance to help support its balance of payments and to finance\r\n    development projects. An unemployment rate of over 30% continues to be a\r\n    major problem.

Agriculture accounts for about 30% of GDP and employs\r\n    40% of the labor force. Principal products include bananas, citrus, mangoes,\r\n    root crops, and coconuts. In 1990, GDP grew by 7%, bouncing back from the\r\n    1.6% decline of 1989.

Rapid growth of free\r\n    trade zones has established a significant expansion of manufacturing for\r\n    export, especially wearing apparel. Over the past decade, tourism has also\r\n    increased in importance and is a major earner of foreign exchange and a\r\n    source of new jobs. Agriculture remains a key sector of the economy.

As part of the 1987 agreement with the IMF, the\r\n    government agreed to institute a reform program to reduce inflation, promote\r\n    economic growth, and improve its external position. The reforms have been\r\n    slow in coming, however, and the economy has been largely stagnant for the\r\n    past four years. The addition of 1 million people every seven months to\r\n    Egypt's population exerts enormous pressure on the 5% of the total land area\r\n    available for agriculture.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $39.2 billion, per capita $720;

Subsistence agriculture predominates,\r\n    with cocoa, coffee, and wood products providing income, foreign exchange,\r\n    and government revenues. There is little industry. Commerce accounts for\r\n    about 8% of GDP and the construction, public works, and service sectors for\r\n    about 38%. Undeveloped natural resources include titanium, iron ore,\r\n    manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold.

The auctioning of large-scale enterprises is now in progress with\r\n    the proceeds being held in escrow until the prior ownership (that is,\r\n    Estonian or the Commonwealth of Independent States) can be established.\r\n    Estonia ranks first in per capita consumption among the former Soviet\r\n    republics. Agriculture is well developed, especially meat production, and\r\n    provides a surplus for export. Only about one-fifth of the work force is in\r\n    agriculture. The major share of the work force engages in manufacturing both\r\n    capital and consumer goods based on raw materials and intermediate products\r\n    from the other former Soviet republics. These manufactures are of high\r\n    quality by ex-Soviet standards and are exported to the other republics.\r\n    Estonia's mineral resources are limited to major deposits of shale oil (60%\r\n    of old Soviet total) and phosphorites (400 million tons). Estonia has a\r\n    large, relatively modern port and produces more than half of its own energy\r\n    needs at highly polluting shale oil power plants. Like the other 14\r\n    successor republics, Estonia is suffering through a difficult transitional\r\n    period - between a collapsed command economic structure and a\r\n    still-to-be-built market structure. It has advantages in the transition, not\r\n    having suffered so long under the Soviet yoke and having better chances of\r\n    developing profitable ties to the Nordic and West European countries.\r\nGDP:\r\n    $NA billion, per capita $NA;

Its\r\n    economy is based on subsistence agriculture, which accounts for about 45% of\r\n    GDP, 90% of exports, and 80% of total employment; coffee generates 60% of\r\n    export earnings. The manufacturing sector is heavily dependent on inputs\r\n    from the agricultural sector. Over 90% of large-scale industry, but less\r\n    than 10% of agriculture, is state run; the government is considering selling\r\n    off a portion of state-owned plants. Favorable agricultural weather largely\r\n    explains the 4.5% growth in output in FY89, whereas drought and\r\n    deteriorating internal security conditions prevented growth in FY90. In 1991\r\n    the lack of law and order, particularly in the south, interfered with\r\n    economic development and growth.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $6.6 billion, per capita $130, real growth rate-\r\n    0.4% (FY90 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    5.2% (1989)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    NA\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $1.8 billion;

A few dairy herds are kept to meet domestic\r\n    consumption of milk and milk products, and crops grown are primarily those\r\n    for providing winter fodder. Exports feature shipments of high-grade wool to\r\n    the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins. Rich stocks of fish in the\r\n    surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders. So far,\r\n    efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry have been unsuccessful. In\r\n    1987 the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers\r\n    operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone. These license fees\r\n    amount to more than $40 million per year and are a primary source of income\r\n    for the government. To encourage tourism, the Falkland Islands Development\r\n    Corporation has built three lodges for visitors attracted by the abundant\r\n    wildlife and trout fishing.\r\nGDP:\r\n    $NA, per capita $NA;

When the nations of the world extended their fishing zones to\r\n    200 nautical miles in the early 1970s, the Faroese no longer could continue\r\n    their traditional long-distance fishing and subsequently depleted their own\r\n    nearby fishing areas. The government's tight controls on fish stocks and its\r\n    austerity measures have caused a recession, and subsidy cuts will force\r\n    further reductions in the fishing industry, which has already been plagued\r\n    with bankrupcies.

Industry, including sugar\r\n    milling, contributes 13% to GDP. Fiji traditionally had earned considerable\r\n    sums of hard currency from the 250,000 tourists who visited each year. In\r\n    1987, however, after two military coups, the economy went into decline. GDP\r\n    dropped by 7.8% in 1987 and by another 2.5% in 1988; political uncertainty\r\n    created a drop in tourism, and the worst drought of the century caused sugar\r\n    production to fall sharply. In contrast, sugar and tourism turned in strong\r\n    performances in 1989, and the economy rebounded vigorously. In 1990 the\r\n    economy received a setback from cyclone Sina, which cut sugar output by an\r\n    estimated 21%.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $1.3 billion, per capita $1,700; real growth rate\r\n    3.5% (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    7.0% (1991)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    5.9% (1991 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $413 million;

Its main economic force is\r\n    the manufacturing sector - principally the wood, metals, and engineering\r\n    industries. Trade is important, with the export of goods representing about\r\n    30% of GDP. Except for timber and several minerals, Finland depends on\r\n    imported raw materials, energy, and some components of manufactured goods.\r\n    Because of the climate, agricultural development is limited to maintaining\r\n    self-sufficiency in basic commodities. The economy, which experienced an\r\n    average of 4.9% annual growth between 1987 and 1989, sank into a deep\r\n    recession in 1991 as growth contracted by 6.2%. The recession - which is\r\n    expected to bottom out in late 1992 - has been caused by economic\r\n    overheating, depressed foreign markets, and the dismantling of the barter\r\n    system between Finland and the former Soviet Union in which Soviet oil and\r\n    gas had been exchanged for Finnish manufactured goods. The Finnish\r\n    Government has proposed efforts to increase industrial competitiveness and\r\n    efficiency by an increase in exports to Western markets, cuts in public\r\n    expenditures, partial privatization of state enterprises, and foreign\r\n    investment and exchange liberalization. Helsinki tied the markkaa to the\r\n    EC's European Currency Unit to promote stability but was forced to devalue\r\n    the markkaa by about 12% in November 1991.

France is largely self-sufficient in agricultural products\r\n    and is a major exporter of wheat and dairy products. The industrial sector\r\n    generates about one-quarter of GDP, and the growing services sector has\r\n    become crucial to the economy. After expanding at a rapid 3.8% pace during\r\n    the period 1988-89, the economy slowed down in 1990, with growth of 1.5% in\r\n    1990 and 1.4% in 1991; growth in 1992 is expected to be about 2%. The\r\n    economy has had difficulty generating enough jobs for new entrants into the\r\n    labor force, resulting in a high unemployment rate, which rose to almost 10%\r\n    in 1991. The steadily advancing economic integration within the European\r\n    Community is a major force affecting the fortunes of the various economic\r\n    sectors.\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $1,033.7 billion, per capita $18,300;

During the period 1981-85, oil accounted for\r\n    about 46% of GDP, 83% of export earnings, and 65% of government revenues on\r\n    average. The high oil prices of the early 1980s contributed to a substantial\r\n    increase in per capita income, stimulated domestic demand, reinforced\r\n    migration from rural to urban areas, and raised the level of real wages to\r\n    among the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. The three-year slide of Gabon's\r\n    economy, which began with falling oil prices in 1985, was reversed in 1989\r\n    because of a near doubling of oil prices over their 1988 lows. In 1990 the\r\n    economy posted strong growth despite serious strikes, but debt servicing\r\n    problems are hindering economic advancement. The agricultural and industrial\r\n    sectors are relatively underdeveloped, except for oil.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $3.3 billion, per capita $3,090; real growth rate\r\n    13% (1990 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    3% (1989 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $1.1 billion;

It is one of the world's poorest countries with a\r\n    per capita income of about $230. About 75% of the population is engaged in\r\n    crop production and livestock raising, which contribute 30% to GDP.\r\n    Small-scale manufacturing activity - processing peanuts, fish, and hides -\r\n    accounts for less than 10% of GDP. Tourism is a growing industry. The Gambia\r\n    imports one-third of its food, all fuel, and most manufactured goods.\r\n    Exports are concentrated on peanut products (about 75% of total value).\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $207 million, per capita $235; real growth rate\r\n    3% (FY91 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    6.0% (FY91)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $79 million; expenditures $84 million, including capital\r\n    expenditures of $21 million (FY90)\r\nExports:\r\n    $116 million (f.o.b., FY90)\r\n  commodities:\r\n    peanuts and peanut products, fish, cotton lint, palm kernels\r\n  partners:\r\n    Japan 60%, Europe 29%, Africa 5%, US 1, other 5% (1989)\r\nImports:\r\n    $147 million (f.o.b., FY90)\r\n  commodities:\r\n    foodstuffs, manufactures, raw materials, fuel, machinery and transport\r\n    equipment\r\n  partners:\r\n    Europe 57%, Asia 25%, USSR/EE 9%, US 6%, other 3% (1989)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n    $336 million (December 1990 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n    growth rate 6.7%; accounts for 5.8% of GDP (FY90)\r\nElectricity:\r\n    30,000 kW capacity; 65 million kWh produced, 75 kWh per capita (1991)\r\nIndustries:\r\n    peanut processing, tourism, beverages, agricultural machinery assembly,\r\n    woodworking, metalworking, clothing\r\nAgriculture:\r\n    accounts for 30% of GDP and employs about 75% of the population; imports\r\n    one-third of food requirements; major export crop is peanuts; the other\r\n    principal crops - millet, sorghum, rice, corn, cassava, palm kernels;\r\n    livestock - cattle, sheep, and goats; forestry and fishing resources not\r\n    fully exploited\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n    US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-89), $93 million; Western (non-US)\r\n    countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments (1970-89), $535 million;\r\n    Communist countries (1970-89), $39 million\r\nCurrency:\r\n    dalasi (plural - dalasi); 1 dalasi (D) = 100 bututs\r\nExchange rates:\r\n    dalasi (D) per US$1 - 8.790 (March 1992), 8.803 (1991), 7.883 (1990), 7.5846\r\n    (1989), 6.7086 (1988), 7.0744 (1987)\r\nFiscal year:\r\n    1 July - 30 June\r\n\r\n:The Gambia Communications\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\n    3,083 km total; 431 km paved, 501 km gravel/laterite, and 2,151 km\r\n    unimproved earth\r\nInland waterways:\r\n    400 km\r\nPorts:\r\n    Banjul\r\nCivil air:\r\n    4 major transport aircraft\r\nAirports:\r\n    1 with permanent-surface runway 2,440-3,659 m\r\nTelecommunications:\r\n    adequate network of radio relay and wire; 3,500 telephones; broadcast\r\n    stations - 3 AM, 2 FM; 1 Atlantic Ocean INTELSAT earth station\r\n\r\n:The Gambia Defense Forces\r\n\r\nBranches:\r\n    Army, Navy, National Gendarmerie, National Police\r\nManpower availability:\r\n    males 15-49, 194,480; 98,271 fit for military service\r\nDefense expenditures:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - more than $1 million, 0.7% of GDP (1989)\r\n\\\r\n\r\n:Gaza Strip Geography\r\n\r\nTotal area:\r\n    380 km2\r\nLand area:\r\n    380 km2\r\nComparative area:\r\n    slightly more than twice the size of Washington, DC\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n    62 km; Egypt 11 km, Israel 51 km\r\nCoastline:\r\n    40 km\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n    Israeli occupied with status to be determined\r\nDisputes:\r\n    Israeli occupied with status to be determined\r\nClimate:\r\n    temperate, mild winters, dry and warm to hot summers\r\nTerrain:\r\n    flat to rolling, sand- and dune- covered coastal plain\r\nNatural resources:\r\n    negligible\r\nLand use:\r\n    arable land 13%, permanent crops 32%, meadows and pastures 0%, forest and\r\n    woodland 0%, other 55%\r\nEnvironment:\r\n    desertification\r\nNote:\r\n    The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended with Israel in\r\n    control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Sinai, and the Golan\r\n    Heights. As stated in the 1978 Camp David accords and reaffirmed by\r\n    President Bush's post - Gulf crisis peace initiative, the final status of\r\n    the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors,\r\n    and a peace treaty be-tween Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the\r\n    concerned parties. Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will\r\n    resolve the respective boundaries. Pending the completion of this process,\r\n    it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip\r\n    has yet to be determined. In the US view, the term West Bank describes all\r\n    of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian administration before\r\n    the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. With respect to negotiations envisaged in the\r\n    framework agreement, however, it is US policy that a distinction must be\r\n    made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the city's\r\n    special status and circumstances. Therefore, a negotiated solution for the\r\n    final status of Jerusalem could be different in character from that of the\r\n    rest of the West Bank.\r\n    The Gaza Strip is currently governed by Israeli military authorities and\r\n    Israeli civil administration; it is US policy that the final status of the\r\n    Gaza Strip will be determined by negotiations among the concerned parties;\r\n    these negotiations will determine how this area is to be governed.\r\n    There are 18 Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip.\r\n\r\n:Gaza Strip People\r\n\r\nPopulation:\r\n    681,026 (July 1992), growth rate 3.6% (1992); in addition, there are 4,000\r\n    Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip (1992 est.)\r\nBirth rate:\r\n    46 births/1,000 population (1992)\r\nDeath rate:\r\n    6 deaths/1,000 population (1992)\r\nNet migration rate:\r\n    - 4 migrants/1,000 population (1992)\r\nInfant mortality rate:\r\n    41 deaths/1,000 live births (1992)\r\nLife expectancy at birth:\r\n    66 years male, 68 years female (1992)\r\nTotal fertility rate:\r\n    6.9 children born/woman (1992)\r\nNationality:\r\n    NA\r\nEthnic divisions:\r\n    Palestinian Arab and other 99.8%, Jewish 0.2%\r\nReligions:\r\n    Muslim (predominantly Sunni) 99%, Christian 0.7%, Jewish 0.3%\r\nLanguages:\r\n    Arabic, Israeli settlers speak Hebrew; English widely understood\r\nLiteracy:\r\n    NA% (male NA%, female NA%)\r\nLabor force:\r\n    (excluding Israeli Jewish settlers) small industry, commerce and business\r\n    32.0%, construction 24.4%, service and other 25.5%, and agriculture 18.1%\r\n    (1984)\r\nOrganized labor:\r\n    NA\r\n\r\n:Gaza Strip Government\r\n\r\nLong-form name:\r\n    none\r\n\r\n:Gaza Strip Economy\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\n    In 1990 roughly 40% of Gaza Strip workers were employed across the border by\r\n    Israeli industrial, construction, and agricultural enterprises, with worker\r\n    remittances accounting for about one-third of GNP. The construction,\r\n    agricultural, and industrial sectors account for about 15%, 12%, and 8% of\r\n    GNP, respectively. Gaza depends upon Israel for some 90% of its external\r\n    trade. Unrest in the territory in 1988-92 (intifadah) has raised\r\n    unemployment and substantially lowered the standard of living of Gazans. The\r\n    Persian Gulf crisis and its aftershocks also have dealt severe blows to Gaza\r\n    since August 1990.

Another salient characteristic of the economy has been\r\n    a flourishing private sector (compared with the other republics). Almost 30%\r\n    of the labor force is employed in agriculture and 18% in industry. Mineral\r\n    resources consist of manganese and copper, and, to a lesser extent,\r\n    molybdenum, arsenic, tungsten, and mercury. Except for very small quantities\r\n    of domestic oil, gas, and coal, fuel must be imported from neighboring\r\n    republics. Oil and its products are delivered by pipeline from Azerbaijan to\r\n    the port of Batumi for export and local refining. Gas is supplied in\r\n    pipelines from Krasnodar and Stavropol'. Georgia is nearly self-sufficient\r\n    in electric power, thanks to abundant hydropower stations as well as some\r\n    thermal power stations. The dismantling of central economic controls is\r\n    being delayed by political factionalism, marked by armed struggles between\r\n    the elected government and the opposition, and industrial output seems to\r\n    have fallen more steeply in Georgia in 1991 than in any other of the former\r\n    Soviet republics. To prevent further economic decline, Georgia must\r\n    establish domestic peace and must maintain economic ties to the other former\r\n    Soviet republics while developing new links to the West.\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $NA;

While western Germany's economy was in recession\r\n    in the last half of 1991, eastern Germany's economy bottomed out after a\r\n    nearly two-year freefall and shows signs of recovery, particularly in the\r\n    construction, transportation, and service sectors. Eastern Germany could\r\n    begin a fragile recovery later, concentrated in 1992 in construction,\r\n    transportation, and services. The two regions remain vastly different,\r\n    however, despite eastern Germany's progress. Western Germany has an advanced\r\n    market economy and is a world leader in exports. It has a highly urbanized\r\n    and skilled population that enjoys excellent living standards, abundant\r\n    leisure time, and comprehensive social welfare benefits. Western Germany is\r\n    relatively poor in natural resources, coal being the most important mineral.\r\n    Western Germany's world-class companies manufacture technologically advanced\r\n    goods. The region's economy is mature: services and manufacturing account\r\n    for the dominant share of economic activity, and raw materials and\r\n    semimanufactured goods constitute a large portion of imports. In recent\r\n    years, manufacturing has accounted for about 31% of GDP, with other sectors\r\n    contributing lesser amounts. Gross fixed investment in 1990 accounted for\r\n    about 21% of GDP. In 1991, GDP in the western region was an estimated\r\n    $19,200 per capita. In contrast, eastern Germany's economy is shedding the\r\n    obsolete heavy industries that dominated the economy during the Communist\r\n    era. Eastern Germany's share of all-German GDP is only about 7%, and eastern\r\n    productivity is just 30% that of the west. The privatization agency for\r\n    eastern Germany, the Treuhand, is rapidly selling many of the 11,500 firms\r\n    under its control. The pace of private investment is starting to pick up,\r\n    but questions about property rights and environmental liabilities remain.\r\n    Eastern Germany has one of the world's largest reserves of low-grade lignite\r\n    coal but little else in the way of mineral resources. The quality of\r\n    statistics from eastern Germany is improving, yet many gaps remain; the\r\n    federal government began producing all-German data for select economic\r\n    statistics at the start of 1992. The most challenging economic problem is\r\n    promoting eastern Germany's economic reconstruction - specifically, finding\r\n    the right mix of fiscal, monetary, regulatory, and tax policies that will\r\n    spur investment in eastern Germany - without destabilizing western Germany's\r\n    economy or damaging relations with West European partners. The biggest\r\n    danger is that excessive wage settlements and heavy federal borrowing could\r\n    fuel inflation and prompt the German Central Bank, the Bundesbank, to keep a\r\n    tight monetary policy to choke off a wage-price spiral. Meanwhile, the FRG\r\n    has been providing billions of dollars to help the former Soviet republics\r\n    and the reformist economies of Eastern Europe.\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - Federal Republic of Germany: $1,331.4 billion,\r\n    per capita $16,700;

Heavily\r\n    dependent on cocoa, gold, and timber exports, economic growth so far has not\r\n    spread substantially to other areas of the economy. The costs of sending\r\n    peacekeeping forces to Liberia and preparing for the transition to a\r\n    democratic government have been boosting government expenditures and\r\n    undercutting structural adjustment reforms. Ghana opened a stock exchange in\r\n    1990.

Tourism continues as a major industry, and\r\n    agriculture - although handicapped by geographic limitations and fragmented,\r\n    small farms - is self-sufficient except for meat, dairy products, and animal\r\n    feedstuffs. The Mitsotakis government inherited several severe economic\r\n    problems from the preceding socialist and caretaker administrations, which\r\n    had neglected the runaway budget deficit, a ballooning current account\r\n    deficit, and accelerating inflation. In early 1991, the government secured a\r\n    $2.5 billion assistance package from the EC under the strictest terms yet\r\n    imposed on a member country, as the EC finally ran out of patience with\r\n    Greece's failure to put its financial affairs in order. Over the next three\r\n    years, Athens must bring inflation down to 7%, cut the current account\r\n    deficit and central government borrowing as a percentage of GDP, slash\r\n    public-sector employment by 10%, curb public-sector pay raises, and broaden\r\n    the tax base.\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $77.6 billion, per capita $7,730;

Maintenance of a social\r\n    welfare system similar to Denmark's has given the public sector a dominant\r\n    role in the economy. In 1990, the economy became critically dependent on\r\n    shrimp exports and on an annual subsidy (now about $500 million) from the\r\n    Danish Government because cod exports dropped off and commercial mineral\r\n    production stopped. As of 1992, the government also has taken control of the\r\n    health sector from Denmark. The new Home Rule government installed in March\r\n    1991 has decided to end much of the central control of the economy and to\r\n    open it wider to competitive forces.\r\nGNP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $500 million, per capita $9,000;

Tourism is\r\n    a key industry, with most tourists from the US. In addition, an increasingly\r\n    large number of cruise ships visit the islands. The traditionally important\r\n    sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by other crops, such as bananas\r\n    (which now supply about 50% of export earnings), eggplant, and flowers.\r\n    Other vegetables and root crops are cultivated for local consumption,\r\n    although Guadeloupe is still dependent on imported food, which comes mainly\r\n    from France.

Agriculture and fishing are the main economic\r\n    activities.

After growing on average at less\r\n    than 1% a year in 1986-87, GDP dropped by 5% a year in 1988-90. The decline\r\n    resulted from bad weather, labor trouble in the canefields, and flooding and\r\n    equipment problems in the bauxite industry. Consumer prices rose about 100%\r\n    in 1989 and 75% in 1990, and the current account deficit widened\r\n    substantially as sugar and bauxite exports fell. Moreover, electric power is\r\n    in short supply and constitutes a major barrier to future gains in national\r\n    output. The government, in association with international financial\r\n    agencies, seeks to reduce its payment arrears and to raise new funds. The\r\n    government's stabilization program - aimed at establishing realistic\r\n    exchange rates, reasonable price stability, and a resumption of growth -\r\n    requires considerable public administrative abilities and continued patience\r\n    by consumers during a long incubation period. In 1991, buoyed by a recovery\r\n    in mining and agriculture, the economy posted 6% growth, according to\r\n    official figures. A large volume of illegal and quasi- legal economic\r\n    activity is not captured in estimates of the country's total output.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $250 million, per capita $300;

Agriculture is mainly\r\n    small-scale subsistence farming and employs nearly three-fourths of the work\r\n    force. The majority of the population does not have ready access to safe\r\n    drinking water, adequate medical care, or sufficient food. Few social\r\n    assistance programs exist, and the lack of employment opportunities remains\r\n    one of the most critical problems facing the economy, along with soil\r\n    erosion and political instability. Trade sanctions applied by the\r\n    Organization of American States in response to the September 1991 coup\r\n    against President Aristide have further damaged the economy.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $2.7 billion, per capita $440;

Productivity remains low. Industry, still in its early stages,\r\n    employs nearly 9% of the labor force, accounts for 15% of GDP, and generates\r\n    20% of exports.

Basic\r\n    problems facing the economy include rapid population growth, high\r\n    unemployment, sharply increased inflation, a lack of basic services, a large\r\n    and inefficient public sector, and the dependence of the export sector\r\n    mostly on coffee and bananas, which are subject to sharp price fluctuations.\r\n    Despite government efforts at reform and large-scale foreign assistance, the\r\n    economy still is unable to take advantage of its sizable natural resources.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $5.2 billion, per capita $1,050;

Natural resources are limited, and food and raw materials must be\r\n    imported. Manufacturing accounts for about 18% of GDP, employs 28% of the\r\n    labor force, and exports about 90% of its output. Real GDP growth averaged a\r\n    remarkable 8% in 1987-88, then slowed to 2.5-3.0% in 1989-90. Unemployment,\r\n    which has been declining since the mid-1980s, is now about 2%. A shortage of\r\n    labor continues to put upward pressure on prices and the cost of living.\r\n    Short-term prospects remain solid so long as major trading partners continue\r\n    to be reasonably prosperous. The crackdown in China in 1989-91 casts a\r\n    shadow over the longer term economic outlook.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $80.9 billion, per capita $13,800; real growth\r\n    rate 3.8% (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    12.0% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    2.0% (1991 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n    $8.8 billion (FY90)\r\nExports:\r\n    $82.0 billion (f.o.b., 1990), including reexports of $53.1 billion\r\n  commodities:\r\n    clothing, textiles, yarn and fabric, footwear, electrical appliances,\r\n    watches and clocks, toys\r\n  partners:\r\n    China 25%, US 24%, Germany 7%, Japan 6%, UK 2%, (1990)\r\nImports:\r\n    $82.4 billion (c.i.f., 1990)\r\n  commodities:\r\n    foodstuffs, transport equipment, raw materials, semimanufactures, petroleum\r\n  partners:\r\n    China 37%, Japan 16%, Taiwan 9%, US 8% (1990)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n    $9.5 billion (December 1990 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n    growth rate 4% 1991 (est)\r\nElectricity:\r\n    8,600,000 kW capacity;

Agriculture is an important sector, providing sizable export\r\n    earnings and meeting domestic food needs. Industry accounts for about 40% of\r\n    GDP and 30% of employment. Hungary claims that less than 20% of foreign\r\n    trade is now with former CEMA countries, while about 70% is with OECD\r\n    members. Hungary's economic reform programs during the Communist era gave it\r\n    a head start in creating a market economy and attracting foreign investment.\r\n    In 1990, Hungary received half of all foreign investment in Eastern Europe\r\n    and in 1991 received the largest single share. The growing private sector\r\n    accounts for one-quarter to one-third of national output according to\r\n    unofficial estimates. Privatization of state enterprises is progressing,\r\n    although excessive redtape, bureaucratic oversight, and uncertainties about\r\n    pricing have slowed the process. Escalating unemployment and high rates of\r\n    inflation may impede efforts to speed up privatization and budget reform,\r\n    while Hungary's heavy foreign debt will make the government reluctant to\r\n    introduce full convertability of the forint before 1993.\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $60.1 billion, per capita $5,700;

The economy is heavily dependent on the fishing\r\n    industry, which provides nearly 75% of export earnings. In the absence of\r\n    other natural resources, Iceland's economy is vulnerable to changing world\r\n    fish prices. The economic improvements resulting from climbing fish prices\r\n    in 1990 and a noninflationary labor agreement probably will be reversed by\r\n    tighter fish quotas and a delay in the construction of an aluminum smelting\r\n    plant. The conservative government's economic priorities include reducing\r\n    the budget and current account deficits, containing inflation, revising\r\n    agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying the economy, and tying the\r\n    krona to the EC's European currency unit in 1993. The fishing industries -\r\n    notably the shrimp industry - are experiencing a series of bankruptcies and\r\n    mergers. Inflation has continued to drop sharply from 20% in 1989 to about\r\n    7.5% in 1991 and possibly 3% in 1992, while unemployment is expected to\r\n    increase to 2.5%.

It presents both the entrepreneurial skills and drives of\r\n    the capitalist system and widespread government intervention of the\r\n    socialist mold. Growth of 4-5% annually in the 1980s has softened the impact\r\n    of population growth on unemployment, social tranquility, and the\r\n    environment. Agricultural output has continued to expand, reflecting the\r\n    greater use of modern farming techniques and improved seed that have helped\r\n    to make India self-sufficient in food grains and a net agricultural\r\n    exporter. However, tens of millions of villagers, particularly in the south,\r\n    have not benefited from the green revolution and live in abject poverty, and\r\n    great numbers of urban residents lack the basic essentials of life. Industry\r\n    has benefited from a partial liberalization of controls. The growth rate of\r\n    the service sector has also been strong. India, however, has been challenged\r\n    more recently by much lower foreign exchange reserves, higher inflation, and\r\n    a large debt service burden.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $328 billion, per capita $380;

Fish from the ocean are of growing economic importance to many of\r\n    the bordering countries as a source of both food and exports. Fishing fleets\r\n    from Russia, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly\r\n    for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being tapped in the\r\n    offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and Western Australia. An\r\n    estimated 40% of the world's offshore oil production comes from the Indian\r\n    Ocean. Beach sands rich in heavy minerals and offshore placer deposits are\r\n    actively exploited by bordering countries, particularly India, South Africa,\r\n    Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.\r\nIndustries:\r\n    based on exploitation of natural resources, particularly marine life,\r\n    minerals, oil and gas production, fishing, sand and gravel aggregates,\r\n    placer deposits\r\n\r\n:Indian Ocean Communications\r\n\r\nPorts:\r\n    Bombay (India), Calcutta (India), Madras (India), Colombo (Sri Lanka),\r\n    Durban (South Africa), Fremantle (Australia), Jakarta (Indonesia), Melbourne\r\n    (Australia), Richard's Bay (South Africa)\r\nTelecommunications:\r\n    submarine cables from India to United Arab Emirates and Malaysia\r\n\r\n:Indonesia Geography\r\n\r\nTotal area:\r\n    1,919,440 km2\r\nLand area:\r\n    1,826,440 km2\r\nComparative area:\r\n    slightly less than three times the size of Texas\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n    2,602 km;

GDP growth in 1985-91\r\n    averaged about 6%, quite impressive, but not sufficient to both slash\r\n    underemployment and absorb the 2.3 million workers annually entering the\r\n    labor force. Agriculture, including forestry and fishing, is an important\r\n    sector, accounting for 23% of GDP and over 50% of the labor force. The\r\n    staple crop is rice. Once the world's largest rice importer, Indonesia is\r\n    now nearly self-sufficient. Plantation crops - rubber and palm oil - and\r\n    textiles and plywood are being encouraged for both export and job\r\n    generation. Industrial output now accounts for 30% of GDP and is based on a\r\n    supply of diverse natural resources, including crude oil, natural gas,\r\n    timber, metals, and coal. Of these, the oil sector dominates the external\r\n    economy, generating more than 20% of the government's revenues and 40% of\r\n    export earnings in 1989. However, the economy's growth is highly dependent\r\n    on the continuing expansion of nonoil exports. Japan is Indonesia's most\r\n    important customer and supplier of aid. In 1991, rapid growth in the money\r\n    supply prompted Jakarta to implement a tight monetary policy, forcing the\r\n    private sector to go to foreign banks for investment financing. Real\r\n    interest rates remained above 10%, off-shore commercial debt grew, and real\r\n    GDP growth dropped slightly from the 7% of 1990.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $122 billion, per capita $630;

After a decade of economic decline, Iran's GNP\r\n    grew roughly 4% in FY90 and 10% in FY91. An oil windfall in 1990 combined\r\n    with a substantial increase in imports contributed to Iran's recent economic\r\n    growth. Iran has also begun implementing a number of economic reforms to\r\n    reduce government intervention (including subsidies) and has allocated\r\n    substantial resources to development projects in the hope of stimulating the\r\n    economy. Nevertheless, lower oil revenues in 1991 - oil accounts for more\r\n    than 90% of export revenues and provides roughly 65% of the financing for\r\n    the five-year economic development plan - and dramatic increases in external\r\n    debt are threatening development plans and could prompt Iran to cut imports,\r\n    thus limiting economic growth in the medium term.\r\nGNP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $90 billion, per capita $1,500;

The\r\n    economy has been dominated by the oil sector, which has provided about 95%\r\n    of foreign exchange earnings. In the 1980s financial problems, caused by\r\n    massive expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and damage to oil\r\n    export facilities by Iran, led the government to implement austerity\r\n    measures and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt payments.\r\n    After the end of hostilities in 1988, oil exports gradually increased with\r\n    the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged facilities.\r\n    Agricultural development remained hampered by labor shortages, salinization,\r\n    and dislocations caused by previous land reform and collectivization\r\n    programs. The industrial sector, although accorded high priority by the\r\n    government, also was under financial constraints. Iraq's seizure of Kuwait\r\n    in August 1990, subsequent international economic embargoes, and military\r\n    actions by an international coalition beginning in January 1991 drastically\r\n    changed the economic picture. Oil exports were cut to near zero, and\r\n    industrial and transportation facilities were severely damaged. Throughout\r\n    1991, the UN's economic embargo worked to reduce exports and imports and to\r\n    increase prices for most goods. The government's policy to allocate goods to\r\n    key supporters of the regime exacerbated shortages.\r\nGNP:\r\n    $35 billion, per capita $1,940; real growth rate 10% (1989 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    45% (1989)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    less than 5% (1989 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $NA billion;

Agriculture, once the most\r\n    important sector, is now dwarfed by industry, which accounts for 37% of GDP\r\n    and about 80% of exports and employs 26% of the labor force. The government\r\n    has successfully reduced the rate of inflation from double-digit figures in\r\n    the late 1970s to 3.8% in 1991. In 1987, after years of deficits, the\r\n    balance of payments was brought into the black. Unemployment, however,\r\n    remains a serious problem.

Pending\r\n    the completion of this process, it is US policy that the final status of the\r\n    West Bank and Gaza Strip has yet to be determined (see West Bank and Gaza\r\n    Strip entries). On 25 April 1982 Israel relinquished control of the Sinai to\r\n    Egypt. Statistics for the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights are included in the\r\n    Syria entry.\r\n\r\n:Israel Geography\r\n\r\nTotal area:\r\n    20,770 km2\r\nLand area:\r\n    20,330 km2\r\nComparative area:\r\n    slightly larger than New Jersey\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n    1,006 km;

It\r\n    depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military\r\n    equipment. Despite limited natural resources, Israel has intensively\r\n    developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years.\r\n    Industry employs about 20% of Israeli workers, agriculture 5%, and services\r\n    most of the rest. Diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural\r\n    products (fruits and vegetables) are leading exports. Israel usually posts\r\n    balance-of-payments deficits, which are covered by large transfer payments\r\n    from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half of the government's $17\r\n    billion external debt is owed to the United States, which is its major\r\n    source of economic and military aid. To earn needed foreign exchange, Israel\r\n    has been targeting high-technology niches in international markets, such as\r\n    medical scanning equipment. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 dealt a\r\n    blow to Israel's economy. Higher world oil prices added an estimated $300\r\n    million to the oil import bill that year and helped keep annual inflation at\r\n    18%. Regional tension and the continuing Palestinian uprising (intifadah)\r\n    have contributed to a sharp drop in tourism - a key foreign exchange earner\r\n    - to the lowest level since the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. The influx of Jewish\r\n    immigrants from the former USSR, which topped 330,000 during the period\r\n    1990-91, will increase unemployment, intensify housing problems, widen the\r\n    government budget deficit, and fuel inflation.\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $54.6 billion, per capita $12,000;

The country is still divided into a\r\n    developed industrial north, dominated by small private companies, and an\r\n    undeveloped agricultural south, dominated by large public enterprises.\r\n    Services account for 48% of GDP, industry about 35%, agriculture 4%, and\r\n    public administration 13%. Most raw materials needed by industry and over\r\n    75% of energy requirements must be imported. After growing at an annual\r\n    average rate of 3% during the period 1983-90, growth slowed to about 1% in\r\n    1991. For the 1990s, Italy faces the problems of refurbishing a tottering\r\n    communications system, curbing pollution in major industrial centers, and\r\n    adjusting to the new competitive forces accompanying the ongoing economic\r\n    integration of the European Community.\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $965.0 billion, per capita $16,700;

Consequently, the economy is highly\r\n    sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for coffee and cocoa and\r\n    to weather conditions. Despite attempts by the government to diversify, the\r\n    economy is still largely dependent on agriculture and related industries.\r\n    The agricultural sector accounts for over one-third of GDP and about 80% of\r\n    export earnings and employs about 85% of the labor force. A collapse of\r\n    world cocoa and coffee prices in 1986 threw the economy into a recession,\r\n    from which the country had not recovered by 1990. Continuing poor prices for\r\n    commodity exports, an overvalued exchange rate, a bloated public-sector wage\r\n    bill, and a large foreign debt hindered economic recovery in 1991.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $10 billion, per capita $800;

In 1985 it suffered a\r\n    setback with the closure of some facilities in the bauxite and alumina\r\n    industry, a major source of hard currency earnings. Since 1986 an economic\r\n    recovery has been under way. In 1987 conditions began to improve for the\r\n    bauxite and alumina industry because of increases in world metal prices. The\r\n    recovery has also been supported by growth in the manufacturing and tourism\r\n    sectors. In September 1988, Hurricane Gilbert inflicted severe damage on\r\n    crops and the electric power system, a sharp but temporary setback to the\r\n    economy. By October 1989 the economic recovery from the hurricane was\r\n    largely complete, and real growth was up about 3% for 1989. In 1991,\r\n    however, growth dropped to 1.0% as a result of the US recession, lower world\r\n    bauxite prices, and monetary instability.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $3.6 billion, per capita $1,400;

Industry, the most important\r\n    sector of the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and\r\n    fuels. Self-sufficent in rice, Japan must import 50% of its requirements for\r\n    other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one of the world's largest\r\n    fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch. Overall\r\n    economic growth has been spectacular: a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5%\r\n    average in the 1970s and 1980s. A major contributor to overall growth of\r\n    4.5% in 1991 was net exports, which cushioned the effect of slower growth in\r\n    domestic demand. Inflation remains low at 3.3% and is easing due to lower\r\n    oil prices and a stronger yen. Japan continues to run a huge trade surplus,\r\n    $80 billion in 1991, which supports extensive investment in foreign assets.\r\n    The increased crowding of its habitable land area and the aging of its\r\n    population are two major long-run problems.\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $2,360.7 billion, per capita $19,000;

Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and especially flowers are\r\n    important export crops, shipped mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy\r\n    cattle is known worldwide and represents an important export earner. Milk\r\n    products go to the UK and other EC countries. In 1986 the finance sector\r\n    overtook tourism as the main contributor to GDP, accounting for 40% of the\r\n    island's output. In recent years the government has encouraged light\r\n    industry to locate in Jersey, with the result that an electronics industry\r\n    has developed alongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear. All raw\r\n    material and energy requirements are imported, as well as a large share of\r\n    Jersey's food needs.\r\nGDP:\r\n    $NA, per capita $NA; real growth rate 8% (1987 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    8% (1988 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $308.0 million; expenditures $284.4 million, including capital\r\n    expenditures of NA (1985)\r\nExports:\r\n    $NA\r\n  commodities:\r\n    light industrial and electrical goods, foodstuffs, textiles\r\n  partners:\r\n    UK\r\nImports:\r\n    $NA\r\n  commodities:\r\n    machinery and transport equipment, manufactured goods, foodstuffs, mineral\r\n    fuels, chemicals\r\n  partners:\r\n    UK\r\nExternal debt:\r\n    $NA\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n    growth rate NA%\r\nElectricity:\r\n    50,000 kW standby capacity (1990); power supplied by France\r\nIndustries:\r\n    tourism, banking and finance, dairy\r\nAgriculture:\r\n    potatoes, cauliflowers, tomatoes; dairy and cattle farming\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n    none\r\nCurrency:\r\n    Jersey pound (plural - pounds); 1 Jersey pound (#J) = 100 pence\r\nExchange rates:\r\n    Jersey pounds (#J) per US$1 - 0.5799 (March 1992), 0.5652 (1991), 0.5603\r\n    (1990), 0.6099 (1989), 0.5614 (1988), 0.6102 (1987), 0.6817 (1986); the\r\n    Jersey pound is at par with the British pound\r\nFiscal year:\r\n    1 April - 31 March\r\n\r\n:Jersey Communications\r\n\r\nPorts:\r\n    Saint Helier, Gorey, Saint Aubin\r\nAirports:\r\n    1 with permanent-surface runway 1,220-2,439 m (Saint Peter)\r\nTelecommunications:\r\n    63,700 telephones; broadcast stations - 1 AM, no FM, 1 TV; 3 submarine\r\n    cables\r\n\r\n:Jersey Defense Forces\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n    defense is the responsibility of the UK\r\n\r\n:Johnston Atoll Geography\r\n\r\nTotal area:\r\n    2.8 km2\r\nLand area:\r\n    2.8 km2\r\nComparative area:\r\n    about 4.7 times the size of the Mall in Washington, DC\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n    none\r\nCoastline:\r\n    10 km\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n  Contiguous zone:\r\n    12 nm\r\n  Continental shelf:\r\n    200 m (depth)\r\n  Exclusive economic zone:\r\n    200 nm\r\n  Territorial sea:\r\n    12 nm\r\nDisputes:\r\n    none\r\nClimate:\r\n    tropical, but generally dry; consistent northeast trade winds with little\r\n    seasonal temperature variation\r\nTerrain:\r\n    mostly flat with a maximum elevation of 4 meters\r\nNatural resources:\r\n    guano (deposits worked until about 1890)\r\nLand use:\r\n    arable land 0%; permanent crops 0%; meadows and pastures 0%; forest and\r\n    woodland 0%; other 100%\r\nEnvironment:\r\n    some low-growing vegetation\r\nNote:\r\n    strategic location 717 nautical miles west-southwest of Honolulu in the\r\n    North Pacific Ocean, about one-third of the way between Hawaii and the\r\n    Marshall Islands; Johnston Island and Sand Island are natural islands; North\r\n    Island (Akau) and East Island (Hikina) are manmade islands formed from coral\r\n    dredging; closed to the public; former nuclear weapons test site; site of\r\n    Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System (JACADS)\r\n\r\n:Johnston Atoll People\r\n\r\nPopulation:\r\n    1,375 (December 1991); all US government personnel and contractors\r\n\r\n:Johnston Atoll Government\r\n\r\nLong-form name:\r\n    none (territory of the US)\r\nType:\r\n    unincorporated territory of the US administered by the US Defense Nuclear\r\n    Agency (DNA) and managed cooperatively by DNA and the Fish and Wildlife\r\n    Service of the US Department of the Interior as part of the National\r\n    Wildlife Refuge system\r\nCapital:\r\n\r\nnone; administered from Washington, DC\r\nDiplomatic representation:\r\n    none (territory of the US)\r\nFlag:\r\n    the flag of the US is used\r\n\r\n:Johnston Atoll Economy\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\n    Economic activity is limited to providing services to US military personnel\r\n    and contractors located on the island.

In\r\n    the remainder of the 1980s, however, reductions in both Arab aid and worker\r\n    remittances slowed economic growth to an average of roughly 2% per year.\r\n    Imports - mainly oil, capital goods, consumer durables, and food - have been\r\n    outstripping exports, with the difference covered by aid, remittances, and\r\n    borrowing. In mid-1989, the Jordanian Government began debt-rescheduling\r\n    negotiations and agreed to implement an IMF program designed to gradually\r\n    reduce the budget deficit and implement badly needed structural reforms. The\r\n    Persian Gulf crisis that began in August 1990, however, aggravated Jordan's\r\n    already serious economic problems, forcing the government to shelve the IMF\r\n    program, stop most debt payments, and suspend rescheduling negotiations. Aid\r\n    from Gulf Arab states and worker remittances have plunged, and refugees have\r\n    flooded the country, straining government resources. Economic recovery is\r\n    unlikely without substantial foreign aid, debt relief, and economic reform.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $3.6 billion, per capita $1,100; real growth rate\r\n    3% (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    9% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    40% (1991 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $1.7 billion;

Kazakhstan is highly dependent\r\n    on trade with Russia, exchanging its natural resources for finished consumer\r\n    and industrial goods. Kazakhstan now finds itself with serious pollution\r\n    problems, backward technology, and little experience in foreign markets. The\r\n    government in 1991 pushed privatization of the economy at a faster pace than\r\n    Russia's program. The ongoing transitional period - marked by sharp\r\n    inflation in wages and prices, lower output, lost jobs, and disruption of\r\n    time-honored channels of supply - has brought considerable social unrest.\r\n    Kazakhstan lacks the funds, technology, and managerial skills for a quick\r\n    recovery of output. US firms have been enlisted to increase oil output but\r\n    face formidable obstacles; for example, oil can now reach Western markets\r\n    only through pipelines that run across independent (and sometimes\r\n    unfriendly) former Soviet republics. Finally, the end of monolithic\r\n    Communist control has brought ethnic grievances into the open. The 6 million\r\n    Russians in the republic, formerly the favored class, now face the hostility\r\n    of a society dominated by Muslims. Ethnic rivalry will be just one of the\r\n    formidable obstacles to the creation of a productive, technologically\r\n    advancing society.\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $NA; per capita NA; real growth rate - 7%\r\n    (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    83% (1991)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $NA million; expenditures $NA million, including capital\r\n    expenditures of $1.76 billion (1991)\r\nExports:\r\n    $4.2 billion (f.o.b., 1991)\r\n  commodities:\r\n    oil, ferrous and nonferrous metals, chemicals, grain, wool, meat (1991)\r\n  partners:\r\n    Russia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan\r\nImports:\r\n    $NA million (c.i.f., 1990)\r\n  commodities:\r\n    machinery and parts, industrial materials\r\n  partners:\r\n    Russia and other former Soviet republics\r\nExternal debt:\r\n    $2.6 billion (1991 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n    growth rate 0.7% (1991)\r\nElectricity:\r\n    17,900,000 kW capacity; 79,100 million kWh produced, 4,735 kWh per capita\r\n    (1991)\r\nIndustries:\r\n    extractive industries (oil, coal, iron ore, manganese, chromite, lead, zinc,\r\n    copper, titanium, bauxite, gold, silver, phosphates, sulfur) iron and steel,\r\n    nonferrous metal, tractors and other agricultural machinery, electric\r\n    motors, construction materials\r\nAgriculture:\r\n    employs 30% of the labor force; grain, mostly spring wheat; meat, cotton,\r\n    wool\r\n\r\n:Kazakhstan Economy\r\n\r\nIllicit drugs:\r\n    illicit producers of cannabis and opium; mostly for domestic consumption;\r\n    status of government eradication programs unknown; used as transshipment\r\n    points for illicit drugs to Western Europe\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n    US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-87), $NA billion; Western (non-US)\r\n    countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments (1970-86), $NA million;\r\n    Communist countries (1971-86), $NA million\r\nCurrency:\r\n    as of May 1992, retaining ruble as currency\r\nExchange rates:\r\n    NA\r\nFiscal year:\r\n    calendar year\r\n\r\n:Kazakhstan Communications\r\n\r\nRailroads:\r\n    14,460 km (all 1.520-meter gauge); does not include industrial lines (1990)\r\nHighways:\r\n    189,000 km total (1990); 188,900 km hard surfaced (paved or gravel), 80,900\r\n    km earth\r\nInland waterways:\r\n    NA km perennially navigable\r\nPipelines:\r\n    crude oil NA km, refined products NA km, natural gas NA\r\nPorts:\r\n    none - landlocked; inland - Guryev\r\nCivil air:\r\n    NA major transport aircraft\r\nAirports:\r\n    NA\r\nTelecommunications:\r\n    telephone service is poor, with only about 6 telephones for each 100\r\n    persons; of the approximately 1 million telephones, Alma-Ata has 184,000;\r\n    international traffic with other former USSR republics and China carried by\r\n    landline and microwave, and with other countries by satellite and through\r\n    the Moscow international gateway switch; satellite earth stations - INTELSAT\r\n    and Orbita\r\n\r\n:Kazakhstan Defense Forces\r\n\r\nBranches:\r\n    Republic Security Forces (internal and border troops), National Guard; CIS\r\n    Forces (Ground, Air, Air Defense, and Strategic Rocket)\r\nManpower availability:\r\n    males 15-49, NA fit for military service; NA reach military age (18)\r\n    annually\r\nDefense expenditures:\r\n    $NA, NA% of GDP\r\n\r\n:Kenya Geography\r\n\r\nTotal area:\r\n    582,650 km2\r\nLand area:\r\n    569,250 km2\r\nComparative area:\r\n    slightly more than twice the size of Nevada\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n    3,477 km; Ethiopia 861 km, Somalia 682 km, Sudan 232 km, Tanzania 769 km,\r\n    Uganda 933 km\r\nCoastline:\r\n    536 km\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n  Exclusive economic zone:\r\n    200 nm\r\n  Territorial sea:\r\n    12 nm\r\nDisputes:\r\n    administrative boundary with Sudan does not coincide with international\r\n    boundary; possible claim by Somalia based on unification of ethnic Somalis\r\nClimate:\r\n    varies from tropical along coast to arid in interior\r\nTerrain:\r\n    low plains rise to central highlands bisected by Great Rift Valley; fertile\r\n    plateau in west\r\nNatural resources:\r\n    gold, limestone, soda ash, salt barytes, rubies, fluorspar, garnets,\r\n    wildlife\r\nLand use:\r\n    arable land 3%; permanent crops 1%; meadows and pastures 7%; forest and\r\n    woodland 4%; other 85%; includes irrigated NEGL%\r\nEnvironment:\r\n    unique physiography supports abundant and varied wildlife of scientific and\r\n    economic value; deforestation; soil erosion; desertification; glaciers on\r\n    Mt.

Commercially viable phosphate\r\n    deposits were exhausted at the time of independence in 1979. Copra and fish\r\n    now represent the bulk of production and exports. The economy has fluctuated\r\n    widely in recent years. Real GDP declined about 8% in 1987, as the fish\r\n    catch fell sharply to only one-fourth the level of 1986 and copra production\r\n    was hampered by repeated rains. Output rebounded strongly in 1988, with real\r\n    GDP growing by 17%. The upturn in economic growth came from an increase in\r\n    copra production and a good fish catch. Following the strong surge in output\r\n    in 1988, GNP increased 1% in both 1989 and 1990.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $36.8 million, per capita $525; real growth rate\r\n    1.0% (1990 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    4.0% (1990 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    2% (1985);

agricultural land is\r\n    collectivized; and state-owned industry produces 95% of manufactured goods.\r\n    State control of economic affairs is unusually tight even for a Communist\r\n    country because of the small size and homogeneity of the society and the\r\n    strict rule of KIM Il-song and his son, KIM Chong-il. Economic growth during\r\n    the period 1984-89 averaged 2-3%, but output declined by 2-4% annually\r\n    during 1990-91, largely because of disruptions in economic relations with\r\n    the USSR. Abundant natural resources and hydropower form the basis of\r\n    industrial development. Output of the extractive industries includes coal,\r\n    iron ore, magnesite, graphite, copper, zinc, lead, and precious metals.\r\n    Manufacturing is centered on heavy industry, with light industry lagging far\r\n    behind. Despite the use of improved seed varieties, expansion of irrigation,\r\n    and the heavy use of fertilizers, North Korea has not yet become\r\n    self-sufficient in food production. Four consecutive years of poor harvests,\r\n    coupled with distribution problems, have led to chronic food shortages.\r\n    North Korea remains far behind South Korea in economic development and\r\n    living standards.\r\nGNP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $23.3 billion, per capita $1,100;

Kuwait has the third-largest oil reserves in the world after Saudi\r\n    Arabia and Iraq. Earnings from hydrocarbons have generated over 90% of both\r\n    export and government revenues and contributed about 40% to GDP. Most of the\r\n    nonoil sector has traditionally been dependent upon oil-derived government\r\n    revenues. Iraq's destruction of Kuwait's oil industry during the Gulf war\r\n    has devastated the economy. Iraq destroyed or damaged more than 80% of\r\n    Kuwait's 950 operating oil wells, as well as sabotaged key surface\r\n    facilities. Firefighters brought all of the roughly 750 oil well fires and\r\n    blowouts under control by November 1991. By yearend, production had been\r\n    brought back to 400,000 barrels per day; it could take two to three years to\r\n    restore Kuwait's oil production to its prewar level of about 2.0 million\r\n    barrels per day. Meanwhile, population had been greatly reduced because of\r\n    the war, from 2.1 million to 1.4 million.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $8.75 billion, per capita $6,200; real growth\r\n    rate -50% (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    NA\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    NA\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $7.1 billion;

Industry,\r\n    concentrated around Bishkek, produces small quantities of electric motors,\r\n    livestock feeding equipment, washing machines, furniture, cement, paper, and\r\n    bricks. Mineral extraction is small, the most important minerals being rare\r\n    earth metals and gold. Kyrgyzstan is a net importer of most types of food\r\n    and fuel but is a net exporter of electricity. By early 1991, the Kirghiz\r\n    leadership had accelerated reform, primarily by privatizing business and\r\n    granting life-long tenure to farmers. In 1991 overall industrial and\r\n    livestock output declined substantially.\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $NA billion, per capita $NA; real growth rate\r\n    -5% (1991)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    88% (1991)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $NA million;

In recent years, however, the government has been\r\n    decentralizing control and encouraging private enterprise. Laos is a\r\n    landlocked country with a primitive infrastructure; that is, it has no\r\n    railroads, a rudimentary road system, limited external and internal\r\n    telecommunications, and electricity available in only a limited area.\r\n    Subsistence agriculture is the main occupation, accounting for over 60% of\r\n    GDP and providing about 85-90% of total employment. The predominant crop is\r\n    rice.

Prices have been\r\n    freed, and privatization of shops and farms has begun. Latvia lacks natural\r\n    resources, aside from its arable land and small forests. Its most valuable\r\n    economic asset is its work force, which is better educated and disciplined\r\n    than in most of the former Soviet republics. Industrial production is highly\r\n    diversified, with products ranging from agricultural machinery to consumer\r\n    electronics. One conspicuous vulnerability: Latvia produces only 10% of its\r\n    electric power needs. Latvia in the near term must retain key commercial\r\n    ties to Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine while moving in the long run toward\r\n    joint ventures, technological support, and trade ties to the West. Because\r\n    of the efficiency of its mostly individual farms, Latvians enjoy a diet that\r\n    is higher in meat, vegetables, and dairy products and lower in grain and\r\n    potatoes than diets in the 12 non-Baltic republics of the USSR. Good\r\n    relations with Russia are threatened by animosity between ethnic Russians\r\n    (34% of the population) and native Latvians.\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $NA; per capital NA;

The cease-fire established in October 1976 between the\r\n    domestic political groups generally held for about six years, despite\r\n    occasional fighting. Syrian troops constituted as the Arab Deterrent Force\r\n    by the Arab League have remained in Lebanon. Syria's move toward supporting\r\n    the Lebanese Muslims, and the Palestinians and Israel's growing support for\r\n    Lebanese Christians, brought the two sides into rough equilibrium, but no\r\n    progress was made toward national reconciliation or political reforms - the\r\n    original cause of the war. Continuing Israeli concern about the Palestinian\r\n    presence in Lebanon led to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June 1982.\r\n    Israeli forces occupied all of the southern portion of the country and\r\n    mounted a summer-long siege of Beirut, which resulted in the evacuation of\r\n    the PLO from Beirut in September under the supervision of a multinational\r\n    force (MNF) made up of US, French, and Italian troops. Within days of the\r\n    departure of the MNF, Lebanon's newly elected president, Bashir Gemayel, was\r\n    assassinated; his elder brother Amin was elected to succeed him. In the\r\n    immediate wake of Bashir's death, however, Christian militiamen massacred\r\n    hundreds of Palestinian refugees in two Beirut camps. This prompted the\r\n    return of the MNF to ease the security burden on Lebanon's weak Army and\r\n    security forces. In late March 1984 the last MNF units withdrew. In 1988,\r\n    President Gemayel completed his term of office. Because parliamentarians\r\n    failed to elect a presidential successor, Gemayel appointed then Lebanese\r\n    Armed Forces (LAF) Commander Gen. Michel Awn acting president. Lebanese\r\n    parliamentarians met in Ta'if, Saudi Arabia, in late 1989 and concluded a\r\n    national reconciliation pact that codified a new power-sharing formula,\r\n    specifying reduced powers for the Christian president and giving Muslims\r\n    more authority. Rene MUAWAD was subsequently elected president on 4 November\r\n    1989, ending a 13-month period during which Lebanon had no president and\r\n    rival Muslim and Christian governments. MUAWAD was assassinated 17 days\r\n    later, on 22 November; on 24 November, Ilyas Harawi was elected to succeed\r\n    MUAWAD. In October 1990, the civil war was apparently brought to a\r\n    conclusion when Syrian and Lebanese forces ousted renegade Christian General\r\n    Awn from his stronghold in East Beirut. Awn had defied the legitimate\r\n    government and established a separate ministate within East Beirut after\r\n    being appointed acting Prime Minister by outgoing President Gemayel in 1988.\r\n    Awn and his supporters feared Ta'if would diminish Christian power in\r\n    Lebanon and increase the influence of Syria. Awn was granted amnesty and\r\n    allowed to travel in France in August 199l. Since the removal of Awn, the\r\n    Lebanese Government has made substantial progress in strengthening the\r\n    central government, rebuilding government institutions, and extending its\r\n    authority throughout the nation. The LAF has deployed from Beirut north\r\n    along the coast road to Tripoli, southeast into the Shuf mountains, and\r\n    south to Sidon and Tyre. Many militiamen from Christian and Muslim groups\r\n    have evacuated Beirut for their strongholds in the north, south, and east of\r\n    the country. Some heavy weapons possessed by the militias have been turned\r\n    over to the government, or sold outside the country, which has begun a plan\r\n    to integrate some militiamen into the military and the internal security\r\n    forces. Lebanon and Syria signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation in\r\n    May 1991. Lebanon continues to be partially occupied by Syrian troops, which\r\n    are deployed in Beirut, its southern suburbs, the Bekaa Valley, and northern\r\n    Lebanon. Iran also maintains a small contingent of revolutionary guards in\r\n    the Bekaa Valley to support Lebanese Islamic fundamentalist groups. Israel\r\n    withdrew the bulk of its forces from the south in 1985, although it still\r\n    retains troops in a 10-km-deep security zone north of its border with\r\n    Lebanon. Israel arms and trains the Army of South Lebanon (ASL), which also\r\n    occupies the security zone and is Israel's first line of defense against\r\n    attacks on its northern border. The following description is based on the\r\n    present constitutional and customary practices of the Lebanese system.\r\n\r\n:Lebanon Economy\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\n    Since 1975 civil war has seriously damaged Lebanon's economic\r\n    infrastructure, cut national output by half, and all but ended Lebanon's\r\n    position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub. Following October\r\n    1990, however, a tentative peace has enabled the central government to begin\r\n    restoring control in Beirut, collect taxes, and regain access to key port\r\n    and government facilities. The battered economy has also been propped up by\r\n    a financially sound banking system and resilient small- and medium-scale\r\n    manufacturers. Family remittances, banking transactions, manufactured and\r\n    farm exports, the narcotics trade, and international emergency aid are main\r\n    sources of foreign exchange. In the relatively settled year of 1991,\r\n    industrial production, agricultural output, and exports showed substantial\r\n    gains. The further rebuilding of the war-ravaged country could provide a\r\n    major stimulus to the economy in 1992, provided that the political and\r\n    military situation remains reasonably calm.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $4.8 billion, per capita $1,400;

Its economy is based on agriculture, light\r\n    manufacturing, and remittances from laborers employed in South Africa ($153\r\n    million in 1989). The great majority of households gain their livelihoods\r\n    from subsistence farming and migrant labor. Manufacturing depends largely on\r\n    farm products to support the milling, canning, leather, and jute industries;\r\n    other industries include textile, clothing, and light engineering.\r\n    Industry's share of GDP rose from 6% in 1982 to 15% in 1989.

Expatriate businessmen fled the\r\n    country, taking capital and expertise with them. Many will not return.\r\n    Richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate\r\n    favorable to agriculture, Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic\r\n    products, while local manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been small in\r\n    scope. Political instability threatens prospects for economic reconstruction\r\n    and repatriation of some 750,000 Liberian refugees who fled to neighboring\r\n    countries.

Since 1980, however, the sharp drop in oil prices and the\r\n    resulting decline in export revenues have adversely affected economic\r\n    development. In 1988 per capita GDP was the highest in Africa at $5,410, but\r\n    GDP growth rates have slowed and fluctuate sharply in response to changes in\r\n    the world oil market. Import restrictions and inefficient resource\r\n    allocations have led to shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs, although\r\n    the reopening of the Libyan-Tunisian border in April 1988 and the\r\n    Libyan-Egyptian border in December 1989 have somewhat eased shortages.\r\n    Austerity budgets and a lack of trained technicians have undermined the\r\n    government's ability to implement a number of planned infrastructure\r\n    development projects. Windfall revenues from the hike in world oil prices in\r\n    late 1990 improved the foreign payments position and resulted in a current\r\n    account surplus for the first time in five years. The nonoil manufacturing\r\n    and construction sectors, which account for about 22% of GDP, have expanded\r\n    from processing mostly agricultural products to include petrochemicals,\r\n    iron, steel, and aluminum. Although agriculture accounts for about 5% of\r\n    GDP, it employs about 20% of the labor force. Climatic conditions and poor\r\n    soils severely limit farm output, and Libya imports about 75% of its food\r\n    requirements.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $28.9 billion, per capita $6,800;

Industry accounts for 53% of total employment, the service sector\r\n    45% (mostly based on tourism), and agriculture and forestry 2%. The sale of\r\n    postage stamps to collectors is estimated at $10 million annually. Low\r\n    business taxes (the maximum tax rate is 20%) and easy incorporation rules\r\n    have induced about 25,000 holding or so-called letter box companies to\r\n    establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein. Such companies, incorporated\r\n    solely for tax purposes, provide 30% of state revenues. The economy is tied\r\n    closely to that of Switzerland in a customs union, and incomes and living\r\n    standards parallel those of the more prosperous Swiss groups.\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $630 million, per capita $22,300;

Although\r\n    substantially above average in living standards and technology in the old\r\n    USSR, Lithuania historically lagged behind Latvia and Estonia in economic\r\n    development. It is ahead of its Baltic neighbors, however, in implementing\r\n    market reform. The country has no important natural resources aside from its\r\n    arable land and strategic location. Industry depends entirely on imported\r\n    materials that have come from the republics of the former USSR. Lithuania\r\n    benefits from its ice-free port at Klaipeda on the Baltic Sea and its rail\r\n    and highway hub at Vilnius, which provides land communication between\r\n    Eastern Europe and Russia, Latvia, Estonia, and Belarus. Industry produces a\r\n    small assortment of high-quality products, ranging from complex machine\r\n    tools to sophisticated consumer electronics. Thanks to nuclear power,\r\n    Lithuania is presently self-sufficient in electricity, exporting its surplus\r\n    to Latvia and Belarus; the nuclear facilities inherited from the USSR,\r\n    however, have come under world scrutiny as seriously deficient in safety\r\n    standards. Agriculture is efficient compared with most of the former Soviet\r\n    Union. Lithuania holds first place in per capita consumption of meat, second\r\n    place for eggs and potatoes, and fourth place for milk and dairy products.\r\n    Grain must be imported to support the meat and dairy industries. As to\r\n    economic reforms, Lithuania is pressing ahead with plans to privatize at\r\n    least 60% of state-owned property (industry, agriculture, and housing)\r\n    having already sold many small enterprises using a voucher system. Other\r\n    government priorities include stimulating foreign investment by protecting\r\n    the property rights of foreign firms and redirecting foreign trade away from\r\n    Eastern markets to the more competitive Western markets. For the moment,\r\n    Lithuania will remain highly dependent on Russia for energy, raw materials,\r\n    grains, and markets for its products.\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $NA; per capita NA;

As a breakaway republic, however, it will\r\n    move down toward a bare subsistence level of life unless economic ties are\r\n    reforged or enlarged with its neighbors Serbia, Albania, Greece, and\r\n    Bulgaria. The economy depends on outside sources for all of its oil and gas\r\n    and its modern machinery and parts. Continued political turmoil, both\r\n    internally and in the region as a whole, prevents any swift readjustments of\r\n    trade patterns and economic rules of the game. Inflation in early 1992 was\r\n    out of control, the result of fracturing trade links, the decline in\r\n    economic activity, and general uncertainties about the future status of the\r\n    country; prices rose 38% in March 1992 alone. Macedonia's geographical\r\n    isolation, technological backwardness, and political instability place it\r\n    far down the list of countries of interest to Western investors. Recognition\r\n    of Macedonia by the EC and an internal commitment to economic reform would\r\n    help to encourage foreign investment over the long run.\r\nGDP:\r\n    $7.1 billion, per capita $3,110;

Agriculture,\r\n    including fishing and forestry, is the mainstay of the economy, accounting\r\n    for over 40% of GDP, employing about 80% of the labor force, and\r\n    contributing to more than 70% of total export earnings. Industry is largely\r\n    confined to the processing of agricultural products and textile\r\n    manufacturing; in 1990 it accounted for only 16% of GDP and employed almost\r\n    5% of the labor force. In 1986 the government introduced a five-year\r\n    development plan that stressed self-sufficiency in food (mainly rice) by\r\n    1990, increased production for exports, and reduced energy imports. After\r\n    mid-1991, however, output dropped sharply because of protracted\r\n    antigovernment strikes and demonstrations for political reform.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $2.4 billion, per capita $200;

Real output grew by 8.8% in 1989,\r\n    10% in 1990, and 8.6% in 1991, helped by vigorous growth in manufacturing\r\n    output, further increases in foreign direct investment - particularly from\r\n    Japanese and Taiwanese firms facing higher costs at home - and increased oil\r\n    production. Malaysia has become the world's third-largest producer of\r\n    semiconductor devices (after the US and Japan) and the world's largest\r\n    exporter of semiconductor devices. Inflation has remained low; unemployment\r\n    has stood at 6% of the labor force; and the government has followed prudent\r\n    fiscal/monetary policies. The country is not self-sufficient in food, and\r\n    some of the rural population subsist at the poverty level. Malaysia's high\r\n    export dependence leaves it vulnerable to a recession in the OECD countries\r\n    or a fall in world commodity prices.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $48.0 billion, per capita $2,670;

Malta produces only about 20% of its food needs, has\r\n    limited freshwater supplies, and has no domestic energy sources.\r\n    Consequently, the economy is highly dependent on foreign trade and services.\r\n    Manufacturing and tourism are the largest contributors to the economy.\r\n    Manufacturing accounts for about 27% of GDP, with the electronics and\r\n    textile industries major contributors. In 1990 inflation was held to a low\r\n    3.0%. Per capita GDP at $7,000 places Malta in the middle-income range of\r\n    the world's nations.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $2.5 billion, per capita $7,000 (1991 est.); real\r\n    growth rate 5.5% (1990)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    3.0% (1990)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    3.8% (1990)\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $1.3 billion;

Agricultural\r\n    production is concentrated on small farms, and the most important commercial\r\n    crops are coconuts, tomatoes, melons, and breadfruit. A few cattle ranches\r\n    supply the domestic meat market. Small-scale industry is limited to\r\n    handicrafts, fish processing, and copra. The tourist industry is the primary\r\n    source of foreign exchange and employs about 10% of the labor force. The\r\n    islands have few natural resources, and imports far exceed exports.

Sugar production has declined, with most of the sugarcane now used\r\n    for the production of rum. Banana exports are increasing, going mostly to\r\n    France. The bulk of meat, vegetable, and grain requirements must be\r\n    imported, contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual\r\n    transfers of aid from France. Tourism has become more important than\r\n    agricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange. The majority of the\r\n    work force is employed in the service sector and in administration. In 1986\r\n    per capita GDP was relatively high at $6,000. During 1986 the unemployment\r\n    rate was 30% and was particularly severe among younger workers.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $2.0 billion, per capita $6,000; real growth rate\r\n    NA% (1986)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    2.9% (1989)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    30% (1986)\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $268 million;

The decline in world demand for this ore, however, has led\r\n    to cutbacks in production. The nation's coastal waters are among the richest\r\n    fishing areas in the world, but overexploitation by foreigners threatens\r\n    this key source of revenue. The country's first deepwater port opened near\r\n    Nouakchott in 1986. In recent years, the droughts, the endemic conflict with\r\n    Senegal, rising energy costs, and economic mismanagement have resulted in a\r\n    substantial buildup of foreign debt. The government has begun the second\r\n    stage of an economic reform program in consultation with the World Bank, the\r\n    IMF, and major donor countries. But the reform process suffered a major\r\n    setback following the Gulf war of early 1991. Because of Mauritania's\r\n    support of Saddam Husayn, bilateral aid from its two top donors, Saudi\r\n    Arabia and Kuwait, was suspended, and multilateral aid was reduced.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $1.1 billion, per capita $535;

In the 1980s, Mexico experienced severe economic\r\n    difficulties: the nation accumulated large external debts as world petroleum\r\n    prices fell; rapid population growth outstripped the domestic food supply;\r\n    and inflation, unemployment, and pressures to emigrate became more acute.\r\n    Growth in national output, however, is recovering, rising from 1.4% in 1988\r\n    to 4% in 1990 and again in 1991. The US is Mexico's major trading partner,\r\n    accounting for two-thirds of its exports and imports. After petroleum,\r\n    border assembly plants and tourism are the largest earners of foreign\r\n    exchange. The government, in consultation with international economic\r\n    agencies, is implementing programs to stabilize the economy and foster\r\n    growth. In 1991 the government began negotiations with the US and Canada on\r\n    a free trade agreement.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $289 billion, per capita $3,200; real growth rate\r\n    4% (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    18.8% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    14-17% (1991 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $41.0 billion;

The\r\n    islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting, except for high-grade\r\n    phosphate. The potential for a tourist industry exists, but the remoteness\r\n    of the location and a lack of adequate facilities hinder development.\r\n    Financial assistance from the US is the primary source of revenue, with the\r\n    US pledged to spend $1 billion in the islands in the l990s.

Moldova has a little more than 1% of the population,\r\n    labor force, capital stock, and output of the former Soviet Union. Living\r\n    standards have been below average for the European USSR. The country enjoys\r\n    a favorable climate, and economic development has been primarily based on\r\n    agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and tobacco. Industry\r\n    accounts for 20% of the labor force, whereas agriculture employs more than\r\n    one-third. Moldova has no major mineral resources and has depended on the\r\n    former Soviet republics for coal, oil, gas, steel, most electronic\r\n    equipment, machine tools, and major consumer durables such as automobiles.\r\n    Its industrial and agricultural products, in turn, have been exported to the\r\n    other former Soviet republics. Moldova has freed prices on most goods and\r\n    has legalized private ownership of property, including agricultural land.\r\n    Moldova's economic prospects are dimmed by the difficulties of moving toward\r\n    a market economy and the political problems of redefining ties to the other\r\n    former Soviet republics and Romania.\r\nGDP:\r\n    NA;

The Principality has\r\n    successfully sought to diversify into services and small, high-value-added,\r\n    nonpolluting industries. The state has no income tax and low business taxes\r\n    and thrives as a tax haven both for individuals who have established\r\n    residence and for foreign companies that have set up businesses and offices.\r\n    About 50% of Monaco's annual revenue comes from value-added taxes on hotels,\r\n    banks, and the industrial sector; about 25% of revenue comes from tourism.\r\n    Living standards are high, that is, roughly comparable to those in\r\n    prosperous French metropolitan suburbs.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $475 million, per capita $16,000;

Economic activity\r\n    traditionally has been based on agriculture and the breeding of livestock -\r\n    Mongolia has the highest number of livestock per person in the world. In\r\n    recent years extensive mineral resources have been developed with Soviet\r\n    support. The mining and processing of coal, copper, molybdenum, tin,\r\n    tungsten, and gold account for a large part of industrial production. Timber\r\n    and fishing are also important sectors. In 1991-92 Mongolian leadership is\r\n    struggling with severe economic dislocations, mainly attributable to the\r\n    economic crumbling of the USSR, by far Mongolia's leading trade and\r\n    development partner. Moscow almost certainly cut aid in 1991, and the\r\n    dissolution of the USSR at yearend 1991 makes prospects for aid quite bleak\r\n    for 1992. Industry in 1991-92 has been hit hard by energy shortages, mainly\r\n    due to disruptions in coal production and shortfalls in petroleum imports.\r\n    The government is moving away from the Soviet-style centrally planned\r\n    economy through privatization and price reform.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $2.1 billion, per capita $900;

Economic performance in 1991 was mixed. A record harvest helped\r\n    real GDP advance by 4.2%, although nonagricultural output grew by less than\r\n    1%. Inflation accelerated slightly as easier financial policies triggered\r\n    rapid credit and monetary growth. Despite recovery of domestic demand,\r\n    import volume growth slowed while export volume was adversely affected by\r\n    phosphate marketing difficulties. In January 1992, Morocco reached a new\r\n    12-month standby arrangement for $129 million with the IMF. In February\r\n    1992, the Paris Club rescheduled $1.4 billion of Morocco's commercial debt.\r\n    This is thought to be Morocco's last rescheduling. By 1993 the Moroccan\r\n    authorities hope to be in a position to meet all debt service obligations\r\n    without additional rescheduling. Servicing this large debt, high\r\n    unemployment, and Morocco's vulnerability to external economic forces remain\r\n    severe long-term problems.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $27.3 billion, per capita $1,060;

Indeed, national output, consumption, and\r\n    investment declined throughout the first half of the 1980s because of\r\n    internal disorders, lack of government administrative control, and a growing\r\n    foreign debt. A sharp increase in foreign aid, attracted by an economic\r\n    reform policy, has resulted in successive years of economic growth since\r\n    1985. Agricultural output, nevertheless, is at about only 75% of its 1981\r\n    level, and grain has to be imported. Industry operates at only 20-40% of\r\n    capacity. The economy depends heavily on foreign assistance to keep afloat.\r\n    The continuation of civil strife through 1991 has dimmed chances of foreign\r\n    investment, and growth was a mere 1%. Living standards, already abysmally\r\n    low, dropped by 3-4% in both 1990 and 1991.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $1.7 billion, per capita $120; real growth rate\r\n    1.0% (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    40.5% (1990 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    50% (1989 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $369 million;

Mining accounts for almost 25% of GDP. Namibia\r\n    is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals in Africa and the world's\r\n    fifth-largest producer of uranium. Alluvial diamond deposits are among the\r\n    richest in the world, making Namibia a primary source for gem-quality\r\n    diamonds. Namibia also produces large quantities of lead, zinc, tin, silver,\r\n    and tungsten, and it has substantial resources of coal. More than half the\r\n    population depends on agriculture (largely subsistence agriculture) for its\r\n    livelihood.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $2 billion, per capita $1,400; real growth rate\r\n    5.1% (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    17% (1991 - Windhoek)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    over 25% (1991)\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $864 million;

Phosphates have given Nauruans\r\n    one of the highest per capita incomes in the Third World - $10,000 annually.\r\n    Few other resources exist, so most necessities must be imported, including\r\n    fresh water from Australia. The rehabilitation of mined land and the\r\n    replacement of income from phosphates are serious long-term problems.\r\n    Substantial amounts of phosphate income are invested in trust funds to help\r\n    cushion the transition.\r\nGNP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - over $90 million, per capita $10,000;

Industrial activity is\r\n    limited, mainly involving the processing of agricultural produce (jute,\r\n    sugarcane, tobacco, and grain). Production of textiles and carpets has\r\n    expanded recently and accounted for 87% of foreign exchange earnings in\r\n    FY89. Apart from agricultural land and forests, the only other exploitable\r\n    natural resources are mica, hydropower, and tourism. Agricultural production\r\n    in the late 1980s grew by about 5%, as compared with annual population\r\n    growth of 2.6%. Forty percent or more of the population is undernourished\r\n    partly because of poor distribution. Since May 1991, the government has been\r\n    encouraging privatization and foreign investment. It has introduced policies\r\n    to eliminate many business licenses and registration requirements in order\r\n    to simplify domestic and foreign investment procedures. Economic prospects\r\n    for the 1990s remain poor because the economy starts from such a low base.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $3.2 billion, per capita $165; real growth rate\r\n    3.5% (FY91)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    15.0% (December 1991)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    5%;

The government has hoped that dynamic growth\r\n    would boost real incomes, reduce inflationary pressures, and permit the\r\n    expansion of welfare benefits. The results have been mixed: inflation is\r\n    down from double-digit levels, but growth has been sluggish and\r\n    unemployment, always a highly sensitive issue, has exceeded 10% since May\r\n    1991.

Four\r\n    private banks have been licensed, and the government has liberalized foreign\r\n    trade and abolished price controls on most goods. Over 50% of the\r\n    agricultural and industrial firms remain state owned. Sandinista economic\r\n    policies and the war had produced a severe economic crisis. The foundation\r\n    of the economy continues to be the export of agricultural commodities,\r\n    largely coffee and cotton. Farm production fell by roughly 7% in 1989 and 4%\r\n    in 1990, and remained about even in 1991. The agricultural sector employs\r\n    44% of the work force and accounts for 15% of GDP and 80% of export\r\n    earnings. Industry, which employs 13% of the work force and contributes\r\n    about 25% to GDP, showed a drop of 7% in 1989, fell slightly in 1990, and\r\n    remained flat in 1991; output still is below pre-1979 levels. External debt\r\n    is one of the highest in the world on a per capita basis.

France is a major customer, while Germany,\r\n    Japan, and Spain also make regular purchases.

In 1991 massive government spending, much of it\r\n    to help ensure a smooth transition to civilian rule, ballooned the budget\r\n    deficit and caused inflation and interest rates to rise. The lack of fiscal\r\n    discipline forced the IMF to declare Nigeria not in compliance with an\r\n    18-month standby facility started in January 1991. Lagos has set ambitious\r\n    targets for expanding oil production capacity and is offering foreign\r\n    companies more attractive investment incentives. Government efforts to\r\n    reduce Nigeria's dependence on oil exports and to sustain noninflationary\r\n    growth, however, have fallen short because of inadequate new investment\r\n    funds and endemic corruption. Living standards continue to deteriorate from\r\n    the higher level of the early 1980s oil boom.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $30 billion, per capita $250; real growth rate\r\n    5.2% (1990 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    40% (1991)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $10 billion;

Government\r\n    expenditures regularly exceed revenues, with the shortfall made up by grants\r\n    from New Zealand - the grants are used to pay wages to public employees. The\r\n    agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening, although some\r\n    cash crops are grown for export. Industry consists primarily of small\r\n    factories to process passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The\r\n    sale of postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of\r\n    revenue. The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of\r\n    population because of migration of Niueans to New Zealand.\r\nGNP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $2.1 million, per capita $1,000; real growth rate\r\n    NA% (1989 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    9.6% (1984)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $5.5 million;

The government controls key areas, such as the\r\n    vital petroleum sector, through large-scale state enterprises and\r\n    extensively subsidizes agricultural, fishing, and other sectors. Norway also\r\n    maintains an extensive welfare system that helps propel public-sector\r\n    expenditures to slightly more than 50% of the GDP and results in one of the\r\n    highest average tax burdens in the world (54%). A small country with a high\r\n    dependence on international trade, Norway is basically an exporter of raw\r\n    materials and semiprocessed goods, with an abundance of small- and\r\n    medium-sized firms, and is ranked among the major shipping nations. The\r\n    country is richly endowed with natural resources - petroleum, hydropower,\r\n    fish, forests, and minerals - and is highly dependent on its oil sector to\r\n    keep its economy afloat. Although one of the government's main priorities is\r\n    to reduce this dependency, this situation is not likely to improve for years\r\n    to come. The government also hopes to reduce unemployment and strengthen and\r\n    diversify the economy through tax reform and an expansionary 1992 budget.\r\n    Forecasters predict that economic growth will rise slightly in 1992 because\r\n    of public-sector expansion and moderate improvements in private investment\r\n    and demand. Inflation will remain about 3%, while unemployment continues at\r\n    record levels of over 5% because of the weakness of the economy outside the\r\n    oil sector. Oslo, a member of the European Free Trade Area, is continuing to\r\n    deregulate and harmonize with EC regulations to prepare for the European\r\n    Economic Area (EEA) - which creates a EC/EFTA market with free movement of\r\n    capital, goods, services, and labor - which takes effect in 1993.\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $72.9 billion, per capita $17,100;

includes Arafura Sea, Banda Sea, Bellingshausen Sea, Bering\r\n    Sea, Bering Strait, Coral Sea, East China Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Makassar\r\n    Strait, Philippine Sea, Ross Sea, Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, South China\r\n    Sea, Tasman Sea, and other tributary water bodies\r\nComparative area:\r\n    slightly less than 18 times the size of the US; the largest ocean (followed\r\n    by the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean); covers about\r\n    one-third of the global surface; larger than the total land area of the\r\n    world\r\nCoastline:\r\n    135,663 km\r\nDisputes:\r\n    some maritime disputes (see littoral states)\r\nClimate:\r\n    the western Pacific is monsoonal - a rainy season occurs during the summer\r\n    months, when moisture-laden winds blow from the ocean over the land, and a\r\n    dry season during the winter months, when dry winds blow from the Asian land\r\n    mass back to the ocean\r\nTerrain:\r\n    surface in the northern Pacific dominated by a clockwise, warm-water gyre\r\n    (broad, circular system of currents) and in the southern Pacific by a\r\n    counterclockwise, cool-water gyre; sea ice occurs in the Bering Sea and Sea\r\n    of Okhotsk during winter and reaches maximum northern extent from Antarctica\r\n    in October; the ocean floor in the eastern Pacific is dominated by the East\r\n    Pacific Rise, while the western Pacific is dissected by deep trenches; the\r\n    world's greatest depth is 10,924 meters in the Marianas Trench\r\nNatural resources:\r\n    oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand and gravel aggregates, placer\r\n    deposits, fish\r\nEnvironment:\r\n    endangered marine species include the dugong, sea lion, sea otter, seals,\r\n    turtles, and whales; oil pollution in Philippine Sea and South China Sea;\r\n    dotted with low coral islands and rugged volcanic islands in the\r\n    southwestern Pacific Ocean; subject to tropical cyclones (typhoons) in\r\n    southeast and east Asia from May to December (most frequent from July to\r\n    October); tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico and strike\r\n    Central America and Mexico from June to October (most common in August and\r\n    September); southern shipping lanes subject to icebergs from Antarctica;\r\n    occasional El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast of Peru when the trade\r\n    winds slacken and the warm Equatorial Countercurrent moves south, killing\r\n    the plankton that is the primary food source for anchovies; consequently,\r\n    the anchovies move to better feeding grounds, causing resident marine birds\r\n    to starve by the thousands because of their lost food source\r\nNote:\r\n    the major choke points are the Bering Strait, Panama Canal, Luzon Strait,\r\n    and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides the Pacific Ocean into the\r\n    North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean; ships subject to\r\n    superstructure icing in extreme north from October to May and in extreme\r\n    south from May to October; persistent fog in the northern Pacific from June\r\n    to December is a hazard to shipping; surrounded by a zone of violent\r\n    volcanic and earthquake activity sometimes referred to as the Pacific Ring\r\n    of Fire\r\n\r\n:Pacific Ocean Economy\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\n    The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world economy and\r\n    particularly to those nations its waters directly touch. It provides cheap\r\n    sea transportation between East and West, extensive fishing grounds,\r\n    offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and sand and gravel for the\r\n    construction industry. In 1985 over half (54%) of the world's total fish\r\n    catch came from the Pacific Ocean, which is the only ocean where the fish\r\n    catch has increased every year since 1978. Exploitation of offshore oil and\r\n    gas reserves is playing an ever-increasing role in the energy supplies of\r\n    Australia, New Zealand, China, US, and Peru. The high cost of recovering\r\n    offshore oil and gas, combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil\r\n    since 1985, has slowed but not stopped new drillings.\r\nIndustries:\r\n    fishing, oil and gas production\r\n\r\n:Pacific Ocean Communications\r\n\r\nPorts:\r\n    Bangkok (Thailand), Hong Kong, Los Angeles (US), Manila (Philippines), Pusan\r\n    (South Korea), San Francisco (US), Seattle (US), Shanghai (China),\r\n    Singapore, Sydney (Australia), Vladivostok (Russia), Wellington (NZ),\r\n    Yokohama (Japan)\r\nTelecommunications:\r\n    several submarine cables with network focused on Guam and Hawaii\r\n\r\n:Pakistan Geography\r\n\r\nTotal area:\r\n    803,940 km2\r\nLand area:\r\n    778,720 km2\r\nComparative area:\r\n    slightly less than twice the size of California\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n    6,774 km total;

In addition, the economy must support a large\r\n    military establishment and provide for the needs of 4 million Afghan\r\n    refugees. A real economic growth rate averaging 5-6% in recent years has\r\n    enabled the country to cope with these problems. Almost all agriculture and\r\n    small-scale industry is in private hands. In 1990, Pakistan embarked on a\r\n    sweeping economic liberalization program to boost foreign and domestic\r\n    private investment and lower foreign aid dependence. The SHARIF government\r\n    has denationalized several state-owned firms and has attracted some foreign\r\n    investment. Pakistan likely will have difficulty raising living standards\r\n    because of its rapidly expanding population. At the current rate of growth,\r\n    population would double in 25 years.\r\nGNP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $45.4 billion, per capita $380; real growth rate\r\n    4.8% (FY91 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    12.3% (FY91)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    10% (FY91 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $6.4 billion;

Budgetary support from Australia and\r\n    development aid under World Bank auspices have helped sustain the economy.\r\n    Robust growth in 1991 was led by the mining sector; the opening of a large\r\n    new gold mine featured in the advance.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $3.1 billion, per capita $800;

Paraguay has\r\n    no known significant mineral or petroleum resources but does have a large\r\n    hydropower potential. Since 1981 economic performance has declined compared\r\n    with the boom period of 1976-81, when real GDP grew at an average annual\r\n    rate of nearly 11%. During the period 1982-86 real GDP fell in three of five\r\n    years, inflation jumped to an annual rate of 32%, and foreign debt rose.\r\n    Factors responsible for the erratic behavior of the economy were the\r\n    completion of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam, bad weather for crops, and weak\r\n    international commodity prices for agricultural exports. In 1987 the economy\r\n    experienced a minor recovery because of improved weather conditions and\r\n    stronger international prices for key agricultural exports. The recovery\r\n    continued through 1990, on the strength of bumper crops in 1988-89. In a\r\n    major step to increase its economic activity in the region, Paraguay in\r\n    March 1991 joined the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), which includes\r\n    Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. During 1991 the government began to more\r\n    seriously address its arrearages with international creditors and its\r\n    domestic fiscal problems. Inflation was cut in third, but the foreign trade\r\n    deficit widened to more than $1 billion. For the long run, the government\r\n    must press forward with general market-oriented economic reforms.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $7.0 billion, per capita $1,460; real growth rate\r\n    3.0% (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    15% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    14% (1991 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $1.2 billion;

In\r\n    the 1980s the economy suffered from hyperinflation, declining per capita\r\n    output, and mounting external debt. Peru was shut off from IMF and World\r\n    Bank support in the mid-1980s because of its huge debt arrears. An austerity\r\n    program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government took office in\r\n    July 1990 contributed to a third consecutive yearly contraction of economic\r\n    activity, but the slide halted late in the year, and output rose 2.4% in\r\n    1991. After a burst of inflation as the austerity program eliminated\r\n    government price subsidies, monthly price increases eased to the\r\n    single-digit level and by December 1991 dropped to the lowest increase since\r\n    mid-1987. Lima obtained a financial rescue package from multilateral lenders\r\n    in September 1991, and, although it faces $14 billion in arrears on its\r\n    external debt, is working to pay some $1.8 billion of these to the IMF and\r\n    World Bank by 1993.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $20.6 billion, per capita $920;

As a result, consumer goods shortages and\r\n    lines disappeared, and inflation fell from 640% in 1989 to 60% in 1991.\r\n    Western governments, which hold two-thirds of Poland's $48 billion external\r\n    debt, pledged in 1991 to forgive half of Poland's official debt by 1994, and\r\n    the private sector grew, accounting for 22% of industrial production and 40%\r\n    of nonagricultural output by 1991. Production fell in state enterprises,\r\n    however, and the unemployment rate climbed steadily from virtually nothing\r\n    in 1989 to 11.4% in December 1991. Poland fell out of compliance with its\r\n    IMF program by mid-1991, and talks with commercial creditors stalled.

Encouraged by duty free access to the US and by tax\r\n    incentives, US firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico since the 1950s.\r\n    Important new industries include pharmaceuticals, electronics, textiles,\r\n    petrochemicals, and processed foods. Sugar production has lost out to dairy\r\n    production and other livestock products as the main source of income in the\r\n    agricultural sector. Tourism has traditionally been an important source of\r\n    income for the island. The economy has largely recovered from the\r\n    disruptions caused by Hurricane Hugo in September 1989. The tourism\r\n    infrastructure has been especially hard hit.\r\nGNP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $21.6 billion, per capita $6,600; real growth\r\n    rate 2.2% (FY90)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    1.3% (October 1990-91)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    15.5% (October 1991)\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $5.8 billion;

Sugarcane has been\r\n    the primary crop for more than a century, and in some years it accounts for\r\n    85% of exports. The government has been pushing the development of a tourist\r\n    industry to relieve high unemployment, which recently amounted to one-third\r\n    of the labor force. The gap in Reunion between the well-off and the poor is\r\n    extraordinary and accounts for the persistent social tensions. The white and\r\n    Indian communities are substantially better off than other segments of the\r\n    population, often approaching European standards, whereas indigenous groups\r\n    suffer the poverty and unemployment typical of the poorer nations of the\r\n    African continent. The outbreak of severe rioting in February 1991\r\n    illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic tensions. The economic\r\n    well-being of Reunion depends heavily on continued financial assistance from\r\n    France.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $3.37 billion, per capita $6,000 (1987 est.);\r\n    real growth rate 9% (1987 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    1.3% (1988)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    35% (February 1991)\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $358 million;

The year 1991 witnessed about a 17% drop in\r\n    industrial production because of energy and input shortages and labor\r\n    unrest. In recent years the agricultural sector has had to contend with\r\n    flooding, mismanagement, shortages of inputs, and disarray caused by the\r\n    dismantling of cooperatives. A shortage of fuel and equipment in 1991\r\n    contributed to a lackluster harvest, a problem compounded by corruption and\r\n    a poor distribution system. The new government is loosening the tight\r\n    central controls of CEAUSESCU'S command economy. It has instituted moderate\r\n    land reforms, with more than one-half of cropland now in private hands, and\r\n    it has liberalized private agricultural output. Also, the new regime is\r\n    permitting the establishment of private enterprises, largely in services,\r\n    handicrafts, and small-scale industry. A law providing for the privatization\r\n    of large state firms has been passed. Most of the large state firms have\r\n    been converted into joint-stock companies, but the selling of shares and\r\n    assets to private owners has been delayed. While the government has halted\r\n    the old policy of diverting food from domestic consumption to hard currency\r\n    export markets, supplies remain scarce in some areas. Furthermore, real\r\n    wages in Romania fell about 20% in 1991, contributing to the unrest which\r\n    forced the resignation of ROMAN in September. The new government continues\r\n    to impose price ceilings on key consumer items.\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $71.9 billion, per capita $3,100; real growth\r\n    rate - 12% (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    215% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    4% (1991 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $19 billion;

Within the now-dismantled USSR, it\r\n    had produced 60% of total output, with 55% of the total labor force and 60%\r\n    of the total capital stock. Russia depends on its world-class deposits of\r\n    oil and gas not only for its own needs but also for vital hard currency\r\n    earnings. Self-sufficient in coal and iron ore, it has a crude steel\r\n    production capacity of about 95 million tons, second only to Japan. Russia's\r\n    machine-building sector - 60% of the old USSR's - lags behind world\r\n    standards of efficiency and quality of product. Other major industrial\r\n    sectors - chemicals, construction materials, light industry, and food\r\n    processing - also suffer from quality problems, obsolescent capital\r\n    equipment, and pollution. Consumer goods have had lower priority, and the\r\n    product mix has not mirrored household preferences. Furthermore, the\r\n    transition to a more market-oriented economy has disrupted channels of\r\n    supply to factories and distribution outlets; substantial imports of foods\r\n    and medical supplies have helped maintain minimum standards of consumption.\r\n    Russia inherited 70% of the former USSR's defense production facilities and\r\n    is experiencing major social problems during conversion of many of these\r\n    plants to civilian production. Russia produces almost half of the old USSR's\r\n    farm products, but most warm-climate crops must be imported. Under the old\r\n    USSR, production of industrial and agricultural goods often was concentrated\r\n    in a single firm or a single republic. Today, producing units often have\r\n    lost their major customers and their major sources of supply, and the market\r\n    institutions and incentives for adjusting to the new political and economic\r\n    situations are only slowly emerging. Rank-and-file Russians will continue to\r\n    suffer major deprivations in 1992 and beyond before the country begins to\r\n    realize its great economic potential. The comprehensive economic reform\r\n    program enacted in January 1992 faces many economic and political hurdles\r\n    before it will lead to sustained economic growth.\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $NA, per capita $NA;

The amount of fertile land is limited, however, and\r\n    deforestation and soil erosion have created problems. The industrial sector\r\n    in Rwanda is small, contributing only 17% to GDP. Manufacturing focuses\r\n    mainly on the processing of agricultural products. The Rwandan economy\r\n    remains dependent on coffee exports and foreign aid. Weak international\r\n    prices since 1986 have caused the economy to contract and per capita GDP to\r\n    decline. A structural adjustment program with the World Bank began in\r\n    October 1990.

The\r\n    economy has been declining, however, because the number of ships stopping at\r\n    Saint Pierre has dropped steadily over the years. In March 1989, an\r\n    agreement between France and Canada set fish quotas for Saint Pierre's\r\n    trawlers fishing in Canadian and Canadian-claimed waters for three years.\r\n    The agreement settles a longstanding dispute that had virtually brought fish\r\n    exports to a halt. The islands are heavily subsidized by France.

Since then, however, cocoa production has\r\n    gradually deteriorated because of drought and mismanagement, so that by 1987\r\n    output had fallen to less than 50% of its former levels. As a result, a\r\n    shortage of cocoa for export has created a serious balance-of-payments\r\n    problem. Production of less important crops, such as coffee, copra, and palm\r\n    kernels, has also declined. The value of imports generally exceeds that of\r\n    exports by a ratio of 4:1. The emphasis on cocoa production at the expense\r\n    of other food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import 90% of food needs.\r\n    It also has to import all fuels and most manufactured goods. Over the years,\r\n    Sao Tome has been unable to service its external debt, which amounts to\r\n    roughly 80% of export earnings. Considerable potential exists for\r\n    development of a tourist industry, and the government has taken steps to\r\n    expand facilities in recent years. The government also implemented a\r\n    Five-Year Plan covering 1986-90 to restructure the economy and reschedule\r\n    external debt service payments in cooperation with the International\r\n    Development Association and Western lenders.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $46.0 million, per capita $400;

The situation in Serbia and\r\n    Montenegro remains fluid in view of the extensive political and military\r\n    strife. This new state faces major economic problems. First, like the other\r\n    former Yugoslav republics, Serbia and Montenegro depended on their sister\r\n    republics for large amounts of foodstuffs, energy supplies, and\r\n    manufactures. Wide varieties in climate, mineral resources, and levels of\r\n    technology among the six republics accentuated this interdependence, as did\r\n    the Communist practice of concentrating much industrial output in a small\r\n    number of giant plants. The breakup of many of the trade links, the sharp\r\n    drop in output as industrial plants lost suppliers and markets, and the\r\n    destruction of physical assets in the fighting all have contributed to the\r\n    economic difficulties of the republics. One singular factor in the economic\r\n    situation of Serbia and Montenegro is the continuation in office of a\r\n    Communist government that is primarily interested in political and military\r\n    mastery, not economic reform. A further complication is the major economic\r\n    sanctions by the leading industrial nations.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $44 billion, per capita $4,200; real growth rate\r\n    NA% (1990)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    60% per month\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    25-40%\r\nBudget:\r\n    NA\r\nExports:\r\n    $4.4 billion (f.o.b., 1990)\r\n  commodities:\r\n    machinery and transport equipment 29%, manufactured goods 28.5%,\r\n    miscellaneous manufactured articles 13.5%, chemicals 11%, food and live\r\n    animals 9%, raw materials 6%, fuels and lubricants 2%, beverages and tobacco\r\n    1%\r\n  partners:\r\n    principally the other former Yugoslav republics;

Subsistence\r\n    agriculture dominates the economy, generating about one-third of GDP and\r\n    employing about two-thirds of the working population. Manufacturing, which\r\n    accounts for roughly 10% of GDP, consists mainly of the processing of raw\r\n    materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic market. Diamond mining\r\n    provides an important source of hard currency. The economy suffers from high\r\n    unemployment, rising inflation, large trade deficits, and a growing\r\n    dependency on foreign assistance. The government in 1990 was attempting to\r\n    get the budget deficit under control and, in general, to bring economic\r\n    policy in line with the recommendations of the IMF and the World Bank. Since\r\n    March 1991, however, military incursions by Liberian rebels in southern and\r\n    eastern Sierra Leone have severely strained the economy and have undermined\r\n    efforts to institute economic reforms.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $1.4 billion, per capita $330;

The economy grew at a respectable 6.5% in 1991,\r\n    down from 8.3% in 1990, in part because of a slowdown in overseas demand and\r\n    lower growth in the financial and business services sector.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $38.3 billion, per capita $13,900;

Chancery at 1300 19th Street NW, Washington,\r\n    DC 20036; telephone (202) 828-1650\r\n  US:\r\n    Ambassador Ignac GOLOB, Embassy at NA (mailing address is APO AE 09862);\r\n    telephone NA\r\n\r\n:Slovenia Government\r\n\r\nFlag:\r\n    a three color flag, white (hoist side), blue, and red of equal width with\r\n    the Slovenian seal (a shield with the image of Triglav in white against a\r\n    blue background at the center; beneath it are two wavy blue lines depicting\r\n    seas and rivers; around it, there are three six-sided stars arranged in an\r\n    inverted triangle); the seal is located in the upper hoist side of the flag\r\n    centered in the white and blue band\r\n\r\n:Slovenia Economy\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\n    Slovenia was by far the most prosperous of the old Yugoslav republics, with\r\n    a per capita income more than twice the Yugoslav average, indeed not far\r\n    below the levels in neighboring Austria and Italy. Because of its strong\r\n    ties to Western Europe and the small scale of damage during internecine\r\n    fighting in Yugoslavia, Slovenia has the brightest prospects among the\r\n    former Yugoslav republics for economic reform and recovery over the next few\r\n    years. The political and economic disintegration of Yugoslavia, however, has\r\n    led to severe short-term dislocations in production, employment, and trade\r\n    ties. For example, overall industrial production fell 10% in 1991;\r\n    particularly hard hit were the iron and steel, machine-building, chemical,\r\n    and textile industries. Meanwhile, fighting has continued in other republics\r\n    leading to further destruction of long-established trade channels and to an\r\n    influx of tens of thousands of Croatian refugees. As in other former\r\n    Communist areas in Eastern Europe, economic reform has often sputtered not\r\n    only because of the vested interests of old bosses in retaining old rules of\r\n    the game but also because of the tangible losses experienced by\r\n    rank-and-file people in the transition to a more market-oriented system. The\r\n    key program for breaking up and privatizing major industrial firms has not\r\n    yet begun. Bright spots for encouraging Western investors are Slovenia's\r\n    comparatively well-educated work force, its developed infrastructure, and\r\n    its Western business attitudes. Slovenia in absolute terms is a small\r\n    economy, and a little Western investment would go a long way.\r\nGDP:\r\n    $21 billion, per capita $10,700; real growth rate -10% (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    15-20% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    10% (April 1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $NA;

Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy, with the\r\n    livestock sector accounting for about 40% of GDP and about 65% of export\r\n    earnings. Nomads and seminomads who are dependent upon livestock for their\r\n    livelihoods make up more than half of the population. Crop production\r\n    generates only 10% of GDP and employs about 20% of the work force. The main\r\n    export crop is bananas; sugar, sorghum, and corn are grown for the domestic\r\n    market. The small industrial sector is based on the processing of\r\n    agricultural products and accounts for less than 10% of GDP.

In contrast, most of the remaining population suffers from\r\n    the poverty patterns of the Third World, including unemployment, lack of job\r\n    skills, and barriers to movement into higher-paying fields. Inputs and\r\n    outputs thus do not move smoothly into the most productive employments, and\r\n    the effectiveness of the market is further lowered by international\r\n    constraints on dealings with South Africa. The main strength of the economy\r\n    lies in its rich mineral resources, which provide two-thirds of exports.\r\n    Average growth of less than 2% in output in recent years falls far short of\r\n    the 5% to 6% level needed to absorb some 300,000 new entrants to the labor\r\n    force annually.

In accordance with its\r\n    accession treaty, Spain has almost wholly liberalized trade and capital\r\n    markets. Foreign and domestic investment has spurred average growth of 4%\r\n    per year. Beginning in 1989, Madrid implemented a tight monetary policy to\r\n    fight inflation - around 7% in 1989 and 1990. As a result growth slowed to\r\n    2.5% in 1991. Spanish policymakers remain concerned with inflation - still\r\n    hovering at 6%. Government officials also are worried about 16%\r\n    unemployment, although many people listed as unemployed work in the\r\n    underground economy.

The\r\n    economy is dominated by governmental entities that account for more than 70%\r\n    of new investment. The private sector's main areas of activity are\r\n    agriculture and trading, with most private industrial investment predating\r\n    1980. The economy's base is agriculture, which employs 80% of the work\r\n    force. Industry mainly processes agricultural items. Sluggish economic\r\n    performance over the past decade, attributable largely to declining annual\r\n    rainfall, has reduced levels of per capita income and consumption. A high\r\n    foreign debt and huge arrearages continue to cause difficulties. In 1990 the\r\n    International Monetary Fund took the unusual step of declaring Sudan\r\n    noncooperative because of its nonpayment of arrearages to the Fund. Despite\r\n    subsequent government efforts to implement reforms urged by the IMF and the\r\n    World Bank, the economy remained stagnant in FY91 as entrepreneurs lack the\r\n    incentive to take economic risks.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $12.1 billion, per capita $450;

The economy has been in\r\n    trouble since the Dutch ended development aid in 1982. A drop in world\r\n    bauxite prices which started in the late 1970s and continued until late 1986\r\n    was followed by the outbreak of a guerrilla insurgency in the interior that\r\n    crippled the important bauxite sector. Although the insurgency has since\r\n    ebbed and the bauxite sector recovered, a military coup in December 1990\r\n    reflected continued political instability and deterred investment and\r\n    economic reform.

By treaty (9\r\n    February 1920), the nationals of the treaty powers have equal rights to\r\n    exploit mineral deposits, subject to Norwegian regulation. Although US, UK,\r\n    Dutch, and Swedish coal companies have mined in the past, the only companies\r\n    still mining are Norwegian and Russian. The settlements on Svalbard are\r\n    essentially company towns. The Norwegian state-owned coal company employs\r\n    nearly 60% of the Norwegian population on the island, runs many of the local\r\n    services, and provides most of the local infrastructure. There is also some\r\n    trapping of seal, polar bear, fox, and walrus.\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $13.3 million, expenditures $13.3 million, including capital\r\n    expenditures of $NA (1990)\r\nElectricity:\r\n    21,000 kW capacity;

Manufacturing, which includes\r\n    a number of agroprocessing factories, accounts for another quarter of GDP.\r\n    Mining has declined in importance in recent years; high-grade iron ore\r\n    deposits were depleted in 1978, and health concerns cut world demand for\r\n    asbestos. Exports of sugar and forestry products are the main earners of\r\n    hard currency.

It has\r\n    essentially full employment, a modern distribution system, excellent\r\n    internal and external communications, and a skilled labor force. Timber,\r\n    hydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy that is\r\n    heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms account for\r\n    about 90% of industrial output, of which the engineering sector accounts for\r\n    50% of output and exports. In the last few years, however, this\r\n    extraordinarily favorable picture has been clouded by inflation, growing\r\n    absenteeism, and a gradual loss of competitiveness in international markets.\r\n    The new center-right government, facing a sagging economic situation which\r\n    is unlikely to improve until 1993, is pushing full steam ahead with economic\r\n    reform proposals to end Sweden's recession and to prepare for possible EC\r\n    membership in 1995. The free-market-oriented reforms are designed to spur\r\n    growth, maintain price stability, lower unemployment, create a more\r\n    efficient welfare state, and further adapt to EC standards. The measures\r\n    include: cutting taxes, particularly the value-added tax (VAT) and levies on\r\n    new and small business; privatization; liberalizing foreign ownership\r\n    restrictions; and opening the welfare system to competition and private\r\n    alternatives, which the government will still finance.

Per capita\r\n    output, general living standards, education and science, health care, and\r\n    diet are unsurpassed in Europe. Economic stability helps promote the\r\n    important banking and tourist sectors. Since World War II, Switzerland's\r\n    economy has adjusted smoothly to the great changes in output and trade\r\n    patterns in Europe and presumably can adjust to the challenges of the 1990s,\r\n    particularly to the further economic integration of Western Europe and the\r\n    amazingly rapid changes in East European political and economic prospects.\r\n    After 8 years of growth, the economy experienced a mild recession in 1991\r\n    because monetary policy was tightened to combat inflation and because of the\r\n    weak international economy. In the second half of 1992, however, Switzerland\r\n    is expected to resume growth, despite inflation and unemployment problems.\r\n    GDP growth for 1992 may be just under 1%, inflation should drop from 5.9% to\r\n    3.5%, and the trade deficit will continue to decline after dropping by over\r\n    15% to $5 billion, due to increased exports to Germany.

Economic\r\n    growth averaged nearly 12% annually in 1990-91, buoyed by increased oil\r\n    production and improved agricultural performance. The Gulf war of early 1991\r\n    provided Syria an aid windfall of several billion dollars from Arab,\r\n    European, and Japanese donors. These inflows more than offset Damascus's\r\n    war-related costs and will help Syria cover some of its debt arrears,\r\n    restore suspended credit lines, and initiate selected military and civilian\r\n    purchases. For the long run, Syria's economy is still saddled with a large\r\n    number of poorly performing public sector firms; investment levels remain\r\n    low; and industrial and agricultural productivity is poor. A major long-term\r\n    concern is the additional drain of upstream Euphrates water by Turkey when\r\n    its vast dam and irrigation projects are completed by mid-decade.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $30 billion, per capita $2,300;

Real growth in GNP has averaged about\r\n    9% a year during the past three decades. Export growth has been even faster\r\n    and has provided the impetus for industrialization. Agriculture contributes\r\n    about 4% to GNP, down from 35% in 1952. Taiwan currently ranks as number 13\r\n    among major trading countries. Traditional labor-intensive industries are\r\n    steadily being replaced with more capital- and technology-intensive\r\n    industries. Taiwan has become a major investor in China, Thailand,\r\n    Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia. The tightening of labor markets\r\n    has led to an influx of foreign workers, both legal and illegal.\r\nGNP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $150.8 billion, per capita $7,380; real growth\r\n    rate 5.2% (1990)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    4.1% (1990);

Agriculture is the\r\n    main economic sector, normally accounting for 38% of employment and\r\n    featuring cotton and fruits. Industry is sparse, bright spots including\r\n    electric power and aluminum production based on the country's sizable\r\n    hydropower resources and a surprising specialty in the production of\r\n    metal-cutting machine tools. In 1991 and early 1992, disruptions in food\r\n    supplies from the outside have severely strained the availability of food\r\n    throughout the republic. The combination of the poor food supply, the\r\n    general disruption of industrial links to suppliers and markets, and\r\n    political instability have meant that the republic's leadership could make\r\n    little progress in economic reform in 1991 and early 1992.\r\nGDP:\r\n    $NA, per capita $NA;

The economy is\r\n    heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for about 47% of GDP,\r\n    provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work force. Industry\r\n    accounts for 8% of GDP and is mainly limited to processing agricultural\r\n    products and light consumer goods. The economic recovery program announced\r\n    in mid-1986 has generated notable increases in agricultural production and\r\n    financial support for the program by bilateral donors. The World Bank, the\r\n    International Monetary Fund, and bilateral donors have provided funds to\r\n    rehabilitate Tanzania's deteriorated economic infrastructure. Growth in 1991\r\n    was featured by a pickup in industrial production and a substantial increase\r\n    in output of minerals led by gold.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $6.9 billion, per capita $260 (1989 est.);

The increasingly sophisticated manufacturing\r\n    sector benefited from export-oriented investment. The manufacturing and\r\n    service sectors have accounted for the lion's share of economic growth.\r\n    Thailand's traditional agricultural sector continued to become less\r\n    important to the overall economy in 1991. The trade deficit continued to\r\n    increase in 1991, to $11 billion; earnings from tourism and remittances grew\r\n    marginally as a result of the Gulf War; and Thailand's import bill grew,\r\n    especially for manufactures and oil. The government has followed fairly\r\n    sound fiscal and monetary policies. Aided by increased tax receipts from the\r\n    fast-moving economy; Bangkok recorded its fourth consecutive budget surplus\r\n    in 1991. The government is moving ahead with new projects - especially for\r\n    telecommunications, roads, and port facilities - needed to refurbish the\r\n    country's overtaxed infrastructure. Political unrest and the military's\r\n    shooting of antigovernment demonstrators in May 1992 have caused\r\n    international businessmen to question Thailand's political stability.\r\n    Thailand's general economic outlook remains good, however, assuming the\r\n    continuation of the government's progrowth measures.\r\nGNP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $92.6 billion, per capita $1,630;

The economy fell sharply through most of the\r\n    1980s, largely because of the decline in oil prices. This sector accounts\r\n    for 80% of export earnings and more than 25% of GDP. The government, in\r\n    response to the oil revenue loss, pursued a series of austerity measures\r\n    that pushed the unemployment rate as high as 22% in 1988. The economy showed\r\n    signs of recovery in 1990, however, helped along by rising oil prices.\r\n    Agriculture employs only about 11% of the labor force and produces about 3%\r\n    of GDP. Since this sector is small, it has been unable to absorb the large\r\n    numbers of the unemployed. The government currently seeks to diversify its\r\n    export base.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $4.9 billion, per capita $3,600; real growth rate\r\n    0.7% (1990)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    11.1% (1990)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    21% (1990)\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $1.5 billion;

Following two years of drought-induced economic\r\n    decline, the economy made a strong recovery in 1990 as a result of a\r\n    bountiful harvest, continued export growth, and higher domestic investment.\r\n    Continued high inflation and unemployment have eroded popular support for\r\n    the government, however, and forced Tunis to slow the pace of economic\r\n    reform. Nonetheless, the government appears committed to implementing its\r\n    IMF-supported structural adjustment program and to servicing its foreign\r\n    debt.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $10.9 billion, per capita $1,320;

Although real growth in per capita\r\n    GDP averaged 5% annually between 1983 and 1988, recent economic performance\r\n    has fallen substantially. Moreover, inflation and interest rates remain\r\n    high, and a large budget deficit will continue to provide difficulties for a\r\n    country undergoing a substantial transformation from a centrally controlled\r\n    to a free market economy. Agriculture remains an important economic sector,\r\n    employing about half of the work force, accounting for 18% of GDP, and\r\n    contributing 19% to exports. The government has launched a\r\n    multibillion-dollar development program in the southeastern region, which\r\n    includes the building of a dozen dams on the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers to\r\n    generate electric power and irrigate large tracts of farmland. The planned\r\n    tapping of huge additional quantities of Euphrates water has raised serious\r\n    concern in the downstream riparian nations of Syria and Iraq. The Turkish\r\n    economy emerged from the Gulf War of early 1991 in stronger shape than\r\n    Ankara had expected. Although the negative effects of the crisis were felt\r\n    primarily in the politically sensitive southeast, aid pledges by the\r\n    coalition allies of more than $4 billion have helped offset the burden.\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $198 billion, per capita $3,400;

This process\r\n    requires wholesale changes in supply sources, markets, property rights, and\r\n    monetary arrangements. Industry - with 10% of the labor force - is heavily\r\n    weighted toward the energy sector, which produced 11% of the ex-USSR's gas\r\n    and 1% of its oil.

The economy has\r\n    been devastated by widespread political instability, mismanagement, and\r\n    civil war since independence in 1962, keeping Uganda poor with a per capita\r\n    income of about $300. (GDP remains below the levels of the early 1970s, as\r\n    does industrial production.) Agriculture is the most important sector of the\r\n    economy, employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee is the major export\r\n    crop and accounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986 the government\r\n    has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking currency\r\n    reform, raising producer prices on export crops, increasing petroleum\r\n    prices, and improving civil service wages. The policy changes are especially\r\n    aimed at dampening inflation, which was running at over 300% in 1987, and\r\n    boosting production and export earnings. During the period 1990-91, the\r\n    economy turned in a solid performance based on continued investment in the\r\n    rehabilitation of infrastructure, improved incentives for production and\r\n    exports, and gradually improving domestic security.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $5.6 billion, per capita $300;

After Russia, the Ukrainian\r\n    republic was far and away the most important economic component of the\r\n    former Soviet Union producing more than three times the output of the\r\n    next-ranking republic. Its fertile black soil generated more than one fourth\r\n    of Soviet agricultural output, and its farms provided substantial quantities\r\n    of meat, milk, grain and vegetables to other republics. Likewise, its\r\n    well-developed and diversified heavy industry supplied equipment and raw\r\n    materials to industrial and mining sites in other regions of the USSR. In\r\n    early 1992 the continued wholesale disruption of economic ties and the lack\r\n    of an institutional structure necessary to formulate and implement economic\r\n    reforms preclude a near-term recovery of output.\r\nGDP:\r\n    $NA, per capita $NA;

The economy is\r\n    essentially capitalistic with a generous admixture of social welfare\r\n    programs and government ownership. Prime Minister MAJOR has continued the\r\n    basic thrust of THATCHER's efforts to halt the expansion of welfare measures\r\n    and promote extensive reprivatization of the government economic sector.\r\n    Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European\r\n    standards, producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the labor\r\n    force. Industry is a mixture of public and private enterprises, employing\r\n    about 27% of the work force and generating 22% of GDP. The UK is an\r\n    energy-rich nation with large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves; primary\r\n    energy production accounts for 12% of GDP, one of the highest shares of any\r\n    industrial nation. In mid-1990 the economy fell into recession after eight\r\n    years of strong economic expansion, which had raised national output by one\r\n    quarter. Britain's inflation rate, which has been consistently well above\r\n    those of her major trading partners, declined significantly in 1991. Between\r\n    1986 and 1990 unemployment fell from 11% to about 6%, but crept back up to\r\n    8% in 1991 because of the economic slowdown. As a major trading nation, the\r\n    UK will continue to be greatly affected by world boom or recession, swings\r\n    in the international oil market, productivity trends in domestic industry,\r\n    and the terms on which the economic integration of Europe proceeds.\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $915.5 billion, per capita $15,900;

The economy is market oriented with most decisions made\r\n    by private individuals and business firms and with government purchases of\r\n    goods and services made predominantly in the marketplace. In 1989 the\r\n    economy enjoyed its seventh successive year of substantial growth, the\r\n    longest in peacetime history. The expansion featured moderation in wage and\r\n    consumer price increases and a steady reduction in unemployment to 5.2% of\r\n    the labor force. In 1990, however, growth slowed to 1% because of a\r\n    combination of factors, such as the worldwide increase in interest rates,\r\n    Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August, the subsequent spurt in oil prices, and\r\n    a general decline in business and consumer confidence. In 1991 output failed\r\n    to recover, unemployment grew, and signs of recovery proved premature.\r\n    Ongoing problems for the 1990s include inadequate investment in economic\r\n    infrastructure, rapidly rising medical costs, and sizable budget and trade\r\n    deficits.\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $5,673 billion, per capita $22,470;

The recovery was led\r\n    by growth in the agriculture and fishing sectors, agriculture alone\r\n    contributing 20% to GDP, employing about 11% of the labor force, and\r\n    generating a large proportion of export earnings. Raising livestock,\r\n    particularly cattle and sheep, is the major agricultural activity. In 1991,\r\n    domestic growth improved somewhat over 1990, but various government factors,\r\n    including concentration on the external sector, adverse weather conditions,\r\n    and greater attention to bringing down inflation and reducing the fiscal\r\n    deficit kept output from expanding rapidly. In a major step toward greater\r\n    regional economic cooperation, Uruguay joined Brazil, Argentina, and\r\n    Paraguay in forming the Southern Cone Common Market (Mercosur). President\r\n    LACALLE continues to press ahead with a broad economic reform plan to reduce\r\n    state intervention in the economy, but he faces strong opposition.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $9.1 billion, per capita $2,935;

Moscow's push for ever-increasing\r\n    amounts of cotton included massive irrigation projects which caused\r\n    extensive environmental damage to the Aral Sea and rivers of the republic.\r\n    Furthermore, the lavish use of chemical fertilizers has caused extensive\r\n    pollution and widespread health problems. Recently the republic has sought\r\n    to encourage food production at the expense of cotton. The small industrial\r\n    sector specializes in such items as agricultural machinery, mineral\r\n    fertilizers, vegetable oil, and electrical cranes. Uzbekistan also has some\r\n    important natural resources including gold (about 30% of Soviet production),\r\n    uranium, and natural gas. The Uzbek government has encouraged land reform\r\n    but has shied away from other aspects of economic reform.\r\nGDP:\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $NA, per capita $NA; real growth rate -0.9%\r\n    (1991)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    83% (1991)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    NA\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $NA;

The economy is\r\n    primarily agricultural; the sector employs about 70% of the labor force and\r\n    accounts for half of GNP. Rice is the staple crop; substantial amounts of\r\n    maize, sorghum, cassava, and sweet potatoes are also grown. The government\r\n    permits sale of surplus grain on the open market. Most of the mineral\r\n    resources are located in the north, including coal, which is an important\r\n    export item. Oil was discovered off the southern coast in 1986 with\r\n    production reaching 70,000 barrels per day in 1991 and expected to increase\r\n    in the years ahead. Following the end of the war in 1975, heavy-handed\r\n    government measures undermined efforts at an efficient merger of the\r\n    agricultural resources of the south and the industrial resources of the\r\n    north. The economy remains heavily dependent on foreign aid and has received\r\n    assistance from UN agencies, France, Australia, Sweden, and Communist\r\n    countries. Inflation, although down from recent triple-digit levels, is\r\n    still a major weakness and is showing signs of accelerating upwards again.\r\n    Per capita output is among the world's lowest. Since late 1986 the\r\n    government has sponsored a broad reform program that seeks to turn more\r\n    economic activity over to the private sector.\r\nGNP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $15 billion, per capita $220;

As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and reaffirmed by\r\n    President Bush's post-Gulf crisis peace initiative, the final status of the\r\n    West Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors, and a\r\n    peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the\r\n    concerned parties. Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will\r\n    resolve the respective boundaries. Pending the completion of this process,\r\n    it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip\r\n    has yet to be determined. In the view of the US, the term West Bank\r\n    describes all of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian\r\n    administration before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. However, with respect to\r\n    negotiations envisaged in the framework agreement, it is US policy that a\r\n    distinction must be made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank\r\n    because of the city's special status and circumstances. Therefore, a\r\n    negotiated solution for the final status of Jerusalem could be different in\r\n    character from that of the rest of the West Bank.\r\n\r\n:West Bank Geography\r\n\r\nTotal area:\r\n    5,860 km2\r\nLand area:\r\n    5,640 km2; includes West Bank, East Jerusalem, Latrun Salient, Jerusalem No\r\n    Man's Land, and the northwest quarter of the Dead Sea, but excludes Mt.\r\n    Scopus\r\nComparative area:\r\n    slightly larger than Delaware\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n    404 km total; Israel 307 km, Jordan 97 km\r\nCoastline:\r\n    none - landlocked\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n    none - landlocked\r\nDisputes:\r\n    Israeli occupied with status to be determined\r\nClimate:\r\n    temperate, temperature and precipitation vary with altitude, warm to hot\r\n    summers, cool to mild winters\r\nTerrain:\r\n    mostly rugged dissected upland, some vegetation in west, but barren in east\r\nNatural resources:\r\n    negligible\r\nLand use:\r\n    arable land 27%, permanent crops 0%, meadows and pastures 32%, forest and\r\n    woodland 1%, other 40%\r\nEnvironment:\r\n    highlands are main recharge area for Israel's coastal aquifers\r\nNote:\r\n    landlocked; there are 175 Jewish settlements in the West Bank and 14\r\n    Israeli-built Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem\r\n\r\n:West Bank People\r\n\r\nPopulation:\r\n    1,362,464 (July 1992), growth rate 3.1% (1992); in addition, there are\r\n    95,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank and 132,000 in East Jerusalem (1992\r\n    est.)\r\nBirth rate:\r\n    35 births/1,000 population (1992)\r\nDeath rate:\r\n    6 deaths/1,000 population (1992)\r\nNet migration rate:\r\n    2 migrants/1,000 population (1992)\r\nInfant mortality rate:\r\n    37 deaths/1,000 live births (1992)\r\nLife expectancy at birth:\r\n    68 years male, 71 years female (1992)\r\nTotal fertility rate:\r\n    4.5 children born/woman (1992)\r\nNationality:\r\n    NA\r\nEthnic divisions:\r\n    Palestinian Arab and other 88%, Jewish 12%\r\nReligions:\r\n    Muslim (predominantly Sunni) 80%, Jewish 12%, Christian and other 8%\r\nLanguages:\r\n    Arabic, Israeli settlers speak Hebrew, English widely understood\r\nLiteracy:\r\n    NA% (male NA%, female NA%)\r\nLabor force:\r\n    NA; excluding Israeli Jewish settlers - small industry, commerce, and\r\n    business 29.8%, construction 24.2%, agriculture 22.4%, service and other\r\n    23.6% (1984)\r\nOrganized labor:\r\n    NA\r\n\r\n:West Bank Government\r\n\r\nLong-form name:\r\n    none\r\nNote:\r\n    The West Bank is currently governed by Israeli military authorities and\r\n    Israeli civil administration.

Capital investment consists largely of residential housing, not\r\n    productive assets that would enable local firms to compete with Israeli\r\n    industry. A major share of GNP is derived from remittances of workers\r\n    employed in Israel and Persian Gulf states, but such transfers from the Gulf\r\n    dropped dramatically after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. In the wake\r\n    of the Persian Gulf crisis, many Palestinians have returned to the West\r\n    Bank, increasing unemployment, and export revenues have plunged because of\r\n    the loss of markets in Jordan and the Gulf states. Israeli measures to\r\n    curtail the intifadah also have pushed unemployment up and lowered living\r\n    standards. The area's economic outlook remains bleak.\r\nGNP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $1.3 billion, per capita $1,200; real growth rate\r\n    -10% (1990 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    11% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    15% (1990 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n    revenues $31.0 million;

In 1991, the developed countries\r\n    grew by 2.5% and the LDCs by 3.5%, these gains being offset by a 10-15% drop\r\n    in the former Communist-dominated areas of the USSR and Eastern Europe. As\r\n    usual, results among individual countries differed widely. In the developed\r\n    group, Japan led with 4.5%, the West European members averaged 1.2%, and the\r\n    recession-plagued United States lagged,with GDP down 0.7%. As for the 15\r\n    former Soviet republics and the seven nations of Eastern Europe, output\r\n    plummeted in many economic sectors because of fundamental changes in the\r\n    rules of the game and in the channels of production and exchange. China and\r\n    the Four Dragons performed well in 1991 but many of the other developing\r\n    countries are mired in poverty and political instability. For the world as a\r\n    whole, the addition of nearly 100 million people each year to an already\r\n    overcrowded globe will exacerbate the problems of pollution,\r\n    desertification, underemployment, epidemics, and famine.\r\nGWP (gross world product):\r\n    purchasing power equivalent - $25 trillion, per capita $4,600; real growth\r\n    rate 1.3% (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n    developed countries 5%; developing countries 50%, with wide variations (1991\r\n    est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n    NA%\r\nExports:\r\n    $3.34 trillion (f.o.b., 1991 est.)\r\n  commodities:\r\n    the whole range of industrial and agricultural goods and services\r\n  partners:\r\n    in value, about 75% of exports from developed countries\r\nImports:\r\n    $3.49 trillion (c.i.f., 1991 est.)\r\n  commodities:\r\n    the whole range of industrial and agricultural goods and services\r\n  partners:\r\n    in value, about 75% of imports by the developed countries\r\nExternal debt:\r\n    $1.0 trillion for less developed countries (1991 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n    growth rate 3% (1990 est.)\r\nElectricity:\r\n    2,864,000,000 kW capacity; 11,450,000 million kWh produced, 2,150 kWh per\r\n    capita (1990)\r\nIndustries:\r\n    industry worldwide is dominated by the onrush of technology, especially in\r\n    computers, robotics, telecommunications, and medicines and medical\r\n    equipment; most of these advances take place in OECD nations; only a small\r\n    portion of non-OECD countries have succeeded in rapidly adjusting to these\r\n    technological forces, and the technological gap between the industrial\r\n    nations and the less-developed countries continues to widen; the rapid\r\n    development of new industrial (and agricultural) technology is complicating\r\n    already grim environmental problems\r\n\r\n:World Economy\r\n\r\nAgriculture:\r\n    the production of major food crops has increased substantially in the last\r\n    20 years. The annual production of cereals, for instance, has risen by 50%,\r\n    from about 1.2 billion metric tons to about 1.8 billion metric tons;\r\n    production increases have resulted mainly from increased yields rather than\r\n    increases in planted areas; while global production is sufficient for\r\n    aggregate demand, about one-fifth of the world's population remains\r\n    malnourished, primarily because local production cannot adequately provide\r\n    for large and rapidly growing populations, which are too poor to pay for\r\n    food imports;

Future economic development depends heavily\r\n    on Western-assisted development of promising oil resources. South Yemen's\r\n    willingness to merge stemmed partly from the steady decline in Soviet\r\n    economic support.\r\nOverview:\r\n  North:\r\n    The low level of domestic industry and agriculture have made northern Yemen\r\n    dependent on imports for virtually all of its essential needs. Large trade\r\n    deficits have been made up for by remittances from Yemenis working abroad\r\n    and foreign aid. Once self-sufficient in food production, northern Yemen has\r\n    become a major importer. Land once used for export crops - cotton, fruit,\r\n    and vegetables - has been turned over to growing qat, a mildly narcotic\r\n    shrub chewed by Yemenis which has no significant export market. Oil export\r\n    revenues started flowing in late 1987 and boosted 1988 earnings by about\r\n    $800 million.\r\n  South:\r\n    This has been one of the poorest Arab countries, with a per capita GNP of\r\n    about $500. A shortage of natural resources, a widely dispersed population,\r\n    and an arid climate have made economic development difficult. The economy\r\n    has grown at an average annual rate of only 2-3% since the mid-1970s. The\r\n    economy had been organized along socialist lines, dominated by the public\r\n    sector. Economic growth has been constrained by a lack of incentives, partly\r\n    stemming from centralized control over production decisions, investment\r\n    allocation, and import choices.\r\nGDP:\r\n    exchange rate conversion - $5.3 billion, per capita $545;

The\r\n    country's chronic economic problems worsened in 1991, with copper and cobalt\r\n    production down 20-30%, inflation near 8,000% in 1991 as compared with 100%\r\n    in 1987-89, and IMF and most World Bank support suspended until the\r\n    institution of agreed-on changes. Agriculture, a key sector of the economy,\r\n    employs 75% of the population but generates under 25% of GDP. The main\r\n    potential for economic development has been the extractive industries.\r\n    Mining and mineral processing account for about one-third of GDP and\r\n    three-quarters of total export earnings.

The manufacturing sector, based on agriculture and mining,\r\n    produces a variety of goods and contributes 35% to GDP. Mining accounts for\r\n    only 5% of both GDP and employment, but supplies of minerals and metals\r\n    account for about 40% of exports. Wide year-to-year fluctuations in\r\n    agricultural production over the past six years have resulted in an uneven\r\n    growth rate, one that on average has matched the 3% annual increase in\r\n    population. Helped by an IMF/World Bank structural adjustment program,\r\n    output rose 3.5% in 1991.

Changes that have been reported but not yet acted on\r\nby BGN are noted.\r\n\r\nArea: Total area is the sum of all land and water areas delimited by\r\ninternational boundaries and/or coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of\r\nall surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines,\r\nexcluding inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Comparative areas\r\nare based on total area equivalents. Most entities are compared with the\r\nentire US or one of the 50 states. The smaller entities are compared with\r\nWashington, DC (178 km2, 69 miles2) or the Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 km2,\r\n0.23 miles2, 146 acres).\r\n\r\nBirth rate: The average annual number of births during a year per 1,000\r\npopulation at midyear; also known as crude birth rate.\r\n\r\nDates of information: In general, information available as of 1 January 1992\r\nwas used in the preparation of this edition. Population figures are estimates\r\nfor 1 July 1992, with population growth rates estimated for mid-1992 through\r\nmid-1993. Major political events have been updated through 30 June 1992.\r\nMilitary age figures are for 1992.\r\n\r\nDeath rate: The average annual number of deaths during a year per l,000\r\npopulation at midyear; also known as crude death rate.\r\n\r\nDiplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic relations with\r\n176 nations (the US has not yet established full diplomatic relations with\r\nBosnia and Hercegovina, Croatia, and Slovenia). The US has diplomatic\r\nrelations with 167 of the 178 UN members - the exceptions are Angola, Bhutan,\r\nBosnia and Hercegovina, Croatia, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Slovenia,\r\nand Vietnam. In addition, the US has diplomatic relations with 9 nations\r\nthat are not in the UN - Andorra, Kiribati, Monaco, Nauru, San Marino,\r\nSwitzerland, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vatican City.\r\n\r\nDisputes: This category includes a wide variety of situations that range from\r\ntraditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral claims of one sort or\r\nanother. Every international land boundary dispute in the ``Guide to Interna-\r\ntional Boundaries,'' a map published by the Department of State, is included.\r\nReferences to other situations may also be included that are border or\r\nfrontier relevant, such as maritime disputes, geopolitical questions, or\r\nirredentist issues. However, inclusion does not necessarily constitute\r\nofficial acceptance or recognition by the US Government.\r\n\r\nEconomic aid: This entry refers to bilateral commitments of official develop-\r\nment assistance (ODA), which is defined as government grants that are\r\nadministered with the promotion of economic development and welfare of LDCs\r\nas their main objective and are concessional in character and contain a\r\ngrant element of at least 25%, and other official flows (OOF) or transactions\r\nby the official sector whose main objective is other than development\r\nmotivated or whose grant element is below the 25% threshold for ODA. OOF\r\ntransactions include official export credits (such as Eximbank credits),\r\nofficial equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization by the\r\nofficial sector that does not meet concessional terms. Aid is considered to\r\nhave been committed when agreements are initialed by the parties involved and\r\nconstitute a formal declaration of intent.\r\n\r\nEntities: Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special sovereignty,\r\nand governments included in this publication are not independent, and others\r\nare not officially recognized by the US Government. ``Nation'' refers to a\r\npeople politically organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory.\r\n``Dependent'' area refers to a broad category of political entities that are\r\nassociated in some way with a nation. Names used for page headings are usually\r\nthe short-form names as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names. The\r\nlong-form name is included in the ``Government'' section, and an entry of\r\n``none'' indicates a long-form name does not exist. In some instances, no\r\nshort-form name exists - then the long-form name must serve for all usages.\r\nThere are 264 entities in The World Factbook that may be categorized as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nNATIONS\r\n\r\n177 UN members (excluding Yugoslavia)\r\n\r\n11 nations that are not members of the UN - Andorra, Georgia, Kiribati,\r\nMacedonia, Monaco, Nauru, Serbia and Montenegro, Switzerland, Tonga, Tuvalu,\r\nVatican City (Holy See)\r\n\r\nOTHER\r\n\r\n1 Taiwan\r\n\r\nDEPENDENT AREAS\r\n\r\n6 Australia - Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling)\r\nIslands, Coral Sea Islands, Heard Island and McDonald Islands, Norfolk Island\r\n\r\n2 Denmark - Faroe Islands, Greenland\r\n\r\n16 France - Bassas da India, Clipperton Island, Europa Island, French Guiana,\r\nFrench Polynesia, French Southern and Antarctic Lands, Glorioso Islands,\r\nGuadeloupe, Juan de Nova Island, Martinique, Mayotte, New Caledonia, Reunion,\r\nSaint Pierre and Miquelon, Tromelin Island, Wallis and Futuna\r\n\r\n2 Netherlands - Aruba, Netherlands Antilles\r\n\r\n3 New Zealand - Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau\r\n\r\n3 Norway - Bouvet Island, Jan Mayen, Svalbard\r\n\r\n1 Portugal - Macau\r\n\r\n16 United Kingdom - Anguilla, Bermuda, British Indian Ocean Territory, British\r\nVirgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey,\r\nHong Kong, Isle of Man, Jersey, Montserrat, Pitcairn Islands, Saint Helena,\r\nSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands\r\n\r\n15 United States - American Samoa, Baker Island, Guam, Howland Island, Jarvis\r\nIsland, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Islands, Navassa Island, Northern\r\nMariana Islands, Palmyra Atoll, Puerto Rico, Trust Territory of the Pacific\r\nIslands (Palau), Virgin Islands, Wake Island\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS\r\n\r\n6 Antarctica, Gaza Strip, Paracel Islands, Spratly Islands, West Bank, Western\r\nSahara\r\n\r\nOTHER ENTITIES\r\n\r\n4 oceans - Arctic Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean\r\n\r\n1 World\r\n\r\n264 total\r\n\r\nnote: The US Government does not recognize the four so-called independent\r\nhomelands of Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, Transkei, and Venda in South Africa.\r\n\r\nGross domestic product (GDP): The value of all goods and services produced\r\ndomestically.\r\n\r\nGross national product (GNP): The value of all goods and services produced\r\ndomestically plus income earned abroad, minus income earned by foreigners\r\nfrom domestic production.\r\n\r\nGNP/GDP methodology: In the ``Economy'' section, GNP/GDP dollar estimates for\r\nthe OECD countries, the former Soviet republics, and the East European\r\ncountries are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations rather\r\nthan from conversions at official currency exchange rates. The PPP method\r\nnormally involves the use of international dollar price weights, which are\r\napplied to the quantities of goods and services produced in a given economy.\r\nIn addition to the lack of reliable data from the majority of countries, the\r\nstatistician faces a major difficulty in specifying, identifying, and allowing\r\nfor the quality of goods and services. The division of a PPP GNP/GDP estimate\r\nin dollars by the corresponding estimate in the local currency gives the PPP\r\nconversion rate. One thousand dollars will buy the same market basket of goods\r\nin the US as one thousand dollars - converted to the local currency at the PPP\r\nconversion rate - will buy in the other country. GNP/GDP estimates for the\r\nLDCs, on the other hand, are based on the conversion of GNP/GDP estimates in\r\nlocal currencies to dollars at the official currency exchange rates. One\r\ncaution: the proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a percent of GNP/GDP\r\nin local currency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when\r\nGNP/GDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example, when an observer\r\nestimates the dollar level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures;\r\nsimilar problems exist when components are expressed in dollars under currency\r\nexchange rate procedures. Finally, as academic research moves forward on the\r\nPPP method, we hope to convert all GNP/GDP estimates to this method in future\r\neditions of The World Factbook.\r\n\r\nGrowth rate (population): The annual percent change in the population,\r\nresulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance\r\nof migrants entering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or\r\nnegative.\r\n\r\nIllicit drugs: There are five categories of illicit drugs - narcotics,\r\nstimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and cannabis. These\r\ncategories include many drugs legally produced and prescribed by doctors as\r\nwell as those illegally produced and sold outside medical channels.\r\n\r\nCannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides\r\nhallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana (pot,\r\nAcapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, Marinol), hashish\r\n(hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).\r\n\r\nCoca (Erythroxylon coca) is a bush, and the leaves contain the stimulant\r\ncocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa, which comes from cacao seeds\r\nand is used in making chocolate, cocoa, and cocoa butter.\r\n\r\nCocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.\r\n\r\nDepressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and include\r\nchloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal, phenobarbital),\r\nbenzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone (Quaalude), glutethimide\r\n(Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl, Valmid).\r\n\r\nDrugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental, emotional,\r\nor behavioral change in an individual.\r\n\r\nDrug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that results\r\nin physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an individual.\r\n\r\nHallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking, self-awareness, and\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\nHallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot), mescaline and peyote (mexc,\r\nbuttons, cactus), amphetamine variants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP,\r\nangel dust, hog), phencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others\r\n(psilocybin, psilocyn).\r\n\r\nHashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis\r\nsativa).\r\n\r\nHeroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.\r\n\r\nMarijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis sativa).\r\n\r\nNarcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to opium,\r\nopium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics include opium\r\n(paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol), codeine (Tylenol\r\nw/codeine, Empirin w/codeine, Robitussan A-C), and thebaine. Semisynthetic\r\nnarcotics include heroin (horse, smack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid).\r\nSynthetic narcotics include meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan),\r\nmethadone (Dolophine, Methadose), and others (Darvon, Lomotil).\r\n\r\nOpium is the milky exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the opium poppy.\r\n\r\nOpium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for many natural and\r\nsemisynthetic narcotics.\r\n\r\nPoppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the mature dried opium\r\npoppy.\r\n\r\nQat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha edulis that\r\nis chewed or drunk as tea.\r\n\r\nStimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and\r\nactivity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines (Desoxyn,\r\nDexedrine), phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others\r\n(Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate).\r\n\r\nInfant mortality rate: The number of deaths to infants under one year old in\r\na given year per l,000 live births occurring in the same year.\r\n\r\nLand use: Human use of the land surface is categorized as arable land - land\r\ncultivated for crops that are replanted after each harvest (wheat, maize,\r\nrice); permanent crops - land cultivated for crops that are not replanted\r\nafter each harvest (citrus, coffee, rubber); meadows and pastures - land\r\npermanently used for herbaceous forage crops; forest and woodland - land\r\nunder dense or open stands of trees; and other - any land type not specifi-\r\ncally mentioned above (urban areas, roads, desert). The percentage figure for\r\nirrigated land refers to the portion of the entire amount of land area that\r\nis artificially supplied with water.\r\n\r\nLeaders: The chief of state is the titular leader of the country who\r\nrepresents the state at official and ceremonial funcions but is not involved\r\nwith the day-to-day activities of the government. The head of government is\r\nthe administrative leader who manages the day-to-day activities of the\r\ngovernment. In the UK, the monarch is the chief of state, and the Prime\r\nMinister is the head of government. In the US, the President is both the\r\nchief of state and the head of government.\r\n\r\nLife expectancy at birth: The average number of years to be lived by a group\r\nof people all born in the same year, if mortality at each age remains\r\nconstant in the future.\r\n\r\nLiteracy: There are no universal definitions and standards of literacy.\r\nUnless otherwise noted, all rates are based on the most common definition -\r\nthe ability to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the standards\r\nthat individual countries use to assess the ability to read and write is\r\nbeyond the scope of this publication.\r\n\r\nMaps: All maps will be available only in the printed version for the fore-\r\nseeable future.\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: The proximity of neighboring states may prevent some\r\nnational claims from being fully extended.\r\n\r\nMerchant marine: All ships engaged in the carriage of goods. All commercial\r\nvessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships), which excludes tugs, fishing\r\nvessels, offshore oil rigs, etc.; also, a grouping of merchant ships by\r\nnationality or register.\r\n\r\nCaptive register - A register of ships maintained by a territory, possession,\r\nor colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships owned in the parent\r\ncountry; also referred to as an offshore register, the offshore equivalent\r\nof an internal register. Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag\r\nas the parent country, or a local variant of it, but will be subject to the\r\nmaritime laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory. Although the\r\nnature of a captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in\r\nthe parent country, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be\r\nowned abroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience\r\nregister, except that it is not the register of an independent state.\r\n\r\nFlag of convenience register - A national register offering registration to a\r\nmerchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major flags of convenience\r\n(FOC) attract ships to their register by virtue of low fees, low or\r\nnonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal manning requirements. True FOC\r\nregisters are characterized by having relatively few of the ships registered\r\nactually owned in the flag state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used\r\nfor ships under a given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where\r\nthe majority of the merchant fleet is owned abroad.\r\nIt is also referred to as an open register.\r\n\r\nFlag state - The nation in which a ship is registered and which holds legal\r\njurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or abroad.\r\nDifferences in flag state maritime legislation determine how a ship is manned\r\nand taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be placed on the register.\r\n\r\nInternal register - A register of ships maintained as a subset of a national\r\nregister. Ships on the internal register fly the national flag and have that\r\nnationality but are subject to a separate set of maritime rules from those on\r\nthe main national register. These differences usually include lower taxation\r\nof profits, manning by foreign nationals, and, usually, ownership outside the\r\nflag state (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian International\r\nShip Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most notable\r\nexamples of an internal register.\r\nBoth have been instrumental in stemming flight from the national flag to\r\nflags of convenience and in attracting foreign-owned ships to the Norwegian\r\nand Danish flags.\r\n\r\nMerchant ship - A vessel that carries goods against payment of freight;\r\ncommonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately restricted to\r\ncommercial vessels only.\r\n\r\nRegister - The record of a ship's ownership and nationality as listed with\r\nthe maritime authorities of a country; also, the compendium of such individual\r\nships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides it with a nationality\r\nand makes it subject to the laws of the country in which registered (the flag\r\nstate) regardless of the nationality of the ship's ultimate owner.\r\n\r\nMoney figures: All are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars unless\r\notherwise indicated.\r\n\r\nNet migration rate: The balance between the number of persons entering and\r\nleaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear\r\npopulation). An excess of persons entering the country is referred to as net\r\nimmigration (3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the\r\ncountry as net emigration (-9.26 migrants/1,000 population).\r\n\r\nPopulation: Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census based on\r\nstatistics from population censuses, vital registration systems, or sample\r\nsurveys pertaining to the recent past, and on assumptions about future trends.\r\n\r\nTotal fertility rate: The average number of children that would be born per\r\nwoman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years and bore\r\nchildren according to a given fertility rate at each age.\r\n\r\nYears: All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless indicated as\r\nfiscal year (FY).\r\n\r\nNote: Information for the US and US dependencies was compiled from material\r\nin the public domain and does not represent Intelligence Community estimates.\r\nThe Handbook of International Economic and Environmental Statistics,\r\npublished annually in September by the Central Intelligence Agency, contains\r\ndetailed economic information for the Organization for Economic Cooperation\r\nand Development (OECD) countries, Eastern Europe, the newly independent\r\nrepublics of the former nations of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, and\r\nselected other countries. The Handbook can be obtained wherever The World\r\nFactbook is available.\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix A:\r\n\r\n The United Nations System\r\n\r\n    The UN is composed of six principal organs and numerous subordinate\r\nagencies and bodies as follows:\r\n\r\n1) Secretariat\r\n\r\n2) General Assembly:\r\n     UNCHS    United Nations Center for Human Settlements (Habitat)\r\n     UNCTAD   United Nations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n     UNDP     United Nations Development Program\r\n     UNEP     United Nations Environment Program\r\n     UNFPA    United Nations Population Fund\r\n     UNHCR    United Nations Office of High Commissioner for Refugees\r\n     UNICEF   United Nations Children's Fund\r\n     UNITAR   United Nations Institute for Training and Research\r\n     UNRWA    United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine\r\n              Refugees in the Near East\r\n     UNSF     United Nations Special Fund\r\n     UNU      United Nations University\r\n     WFC      World Food Council\r\n     WFP      World Food Program\r\n\r\n3) Security Council:\r\n     UNAVEM   United Nations Angola Verification Mission\r\n     UNDOF    United Nations Disengagement Observer Force\r\n     UNFICYP  United Nations Force in Cyprus\r\n     UNIFIL   United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon\r\n     UNIIMOG  United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group\r\n     UNMOGIP  United Nations Military Observer Group in India and\r\n              Pakistan\r\n     UNTSO    United Nations Truce Supervision Organization\r\n\r\n4) Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC):\r\n     Specialized agencies\r\n       FAO      Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\r\n       IBRD     International Bank for Reconstruction and Development\r\n       ICAO     International Civil Aviation Organization\r\n       IDA      International Development Association\r\n       IFAD     International Fund for Agricultural Development\r\n       IFC      International Finance Corporation\r\n       ILO      International Labor Organization\r\n       IMF      International Monetary Fund\r\n       IMO      International Maritime Organization\r\n       ITU      International Telecommunication Union\r\n       UNESCO   United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural\r\n                Organization\r\n       UNIDO    United Nations Industrial Development Organization\r\n       UPU      Universal Postal Union\r\n       WHO      World Health Organization\r\n       WIPO     World Intellectual Property Organization\r\n       WMO      World Meteorological Organization\r\n                Related organizations\r\n       GATT     General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\r\n       IAEA     International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n     Regional commissions\r\n       ECA      Economic Commission for Africa\r\n       ECE      Economic Commission for Europe\r\n       ECLAC    Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean\r\n       ESCAP    Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific\r\n       ESCWA    Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia\r\n     Functional commissions\r\n       Commission on Human Rights\r\n       Commission on Narcotic Drugs\r\n       Commission for Social Development\r\n       Commission on the Status of Women\r\n       Population Commission\r\n       Statistical Commission\r\n\r\n5) Trusteeship Council\r\n\r\n6) International Court of Justice (ICJ)\r\n\r\nAppendix B\r\n\r\nAbbreviations for International Organizations and Groups\r\n\r\nABEDA    Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa\r\nACC      Arab Cooperation Council\r\nACCT     Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation\r\nACP      African, Caribbean, and Pacific Countries\r\nAfDB     African Development Bank\r\nAFESD    Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development\r\nAG       Andean Group\r\nAL       Arab League\r\nALADI    Asociacion Latinoamericana de Integracion;
