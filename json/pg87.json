edition. Czechoslovakia has\r\nbeen superseded by the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Eritrea gained independence\r\nfrom Ethiopia. The name of the Ivory Coast has been changed to Cote d'Ivoire and\r\nthe Vatican City became the Holy See. New entries include Location, Map\r\nreferences, Abbreviation (often substituted for the country name), and Digraph\r\n(two-letter country code). Names is a new entry which includes long and short\r\nforms of both conventional and local names of countries as well as any former\r\nnames. Most diacritical marks have been omitted. The electronic files used to\r\nproduce the Factbook have been restructured into a database. As a result, the\r\nformats of some entries in this edition have been changed. Additional changes\r\nwill occur in the 1994 Factbook. Irrigated land is a new entry with the data\r\nseparate from the Land use entry. The Disputes entry is now International\r\ndisputes. The GNP/GDP entry was renamed National Product and the per capita and\r\nreal growth rate data placed in separate entries. Similar changes were made in\r\nthe Population and Diplomatic Representation entries.\r\n\r\nAbbreviations: (see Appendix B for international organizations and groups)\r\n\r\navdp.\r\navoirdupois\r\n\r\nc.i.f.\r\ncost, insurance, and freight\r\n\r\nCY\r\ncalendar year\r\n\r\nDWT\r\ndeadweight ton\r\n\r\nest.\r\nestimate\r\n\r\nEx-Im\r\nExport-Import Bank of the United States\r\n\r\nf.o.b.\r\nfree on board\r\n\r\nFRG\r\nFederal Republic of Germany (West Germany); used for information dated before 3\r\nOctober 1990 or CY91\r\n\r\nFY\r\nfiscal year\r\n\r\nGDP\r\ngross domestic product\r\n\r\nGDR\r\nGerman Democratic Republic (East Germany); used for information dated before 3\r\nOctober 1990 or CY91\r\n\r\nGNP\r\ngross national product\r\n\r\nGRT\r\ngross register ton\r\n\r\nGWP\r\ngross world product\r\n\r\nkm\r\nkilometer\r\n\r\nkm2\r\nsquare kilometer\r\n\r\nkW\r\nkilowatt\r\n\r\nkWh\r\nkilowatt hour\r\n\r\nm\r\nmeter\r\n\r\nNA\r\nnot available\r\n\r\nNEGL\r\nnegligible\r\n\r\nnm\r\nnautical mile\r\n\r\nNZ\r\nNew Zealand\r\n\r\nODA\r\nofficial development assistance\r\n\r\nOOF\r\nother official flows\r\n\r\nPDRY\r\nPeople's Democratic Republic of Yemen [Yemen (Aden) or South Yemen]; used for\r\ninformation dated before 22 May 1990 or CY91\r\n\r\nUAE\r\nUnited Arab Emirates\r\n\r\nUK\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\n\r\nUS\r\nUnited States\r\n\r\nUSSR\r\nUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics (Soviet Union); used for information dated\r\nbefore 25 December 1991\r\n\r\nYAR\r\nYemen Arab Republic [Yemen (Sanaa) or North Yemen]; used\r\nfor information dated before 22 May 1990 or CY91\r\n\r\nAdministrative divisions: The numbers, designatory terms, and first-order\r\nadministrative divisions are generally those approved by the US Board on\r\nGeographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been reported but not yet acted on by\r\nBGN are noted.\r\n\r\nArea: Total area is the sum of all land and water areas delimited by\r\ninternational boundaries and/or coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of all\r\nsurfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding\r\ninland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Comparative areas are based on\r\ntotal area equivalents. Most entities are compared with the entire US or one of\r\nthe 50 states. The smaller entities are compared with Washington, DC (178 km2,\r\n69 miles 2) or The Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 km2, 0.23 miles 2,146 acres).\r\n\r\nBirth rate: The average annual number of births during a year per 1,000\r\npopulation at midyear; also known as crude birth rate.\r\n\r\nDates of information: In general, information available as of 1 January 1993 was\r\nused in the preparation of this edition. Population figures are estimates for 1\r\nJuly 1993, with population growth rates estimated for calendar year 1993. Major\r\npolitical events have been updated through June 1993.\r\n\r\nDeath rate: The average annual number of deaths during a year per l,000\r\npopulation at midyear; also known as crude death rate.\r\n\r\nDigraphs: The digraph is a two-letter \"country code'' that precisely identifies\r\nevery entity without overlap, duplication, or omission. AF, for example, is the\r\ndigraph for Afghanistan. It is a standardized geopolitical data element\r\npromulgated in the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS)\r\n10-3 by the National Bureau of Standards (US Department of Commerce) and\r\nmaintained by the Office of the Geographer (US Department of State). The digraph\r\nis used to eliminate confusion and incompatibility in the collection,\r\nprocessing, and dissemination of area-specific data and is particularly useful\r\nfor interchanging data between databases.\r\n\r\nDiplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic relations with 180\r\nnations. The US has diplomatic relations with 174 of the 182 UN members\r\n(excluding the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia whose status in the UN\r\nis unclear)--the exceptions are Angola, Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Macedonia,\r\nNorth Korea, and Vietnam. In addition, the US has diplomatic relations with 7\r\nnations that are not in the UN-Andorra, Holy See, Kiribati, Nauru, Switzerland,\r\nTonga, and Tuvalu.\r\n\r\nEconomic aid: This entry refers to bilateral commitments of official development\r\nassistance (ODA), which is defined as government grants that are administered\r\nwith the promotion of economic development and welfare of LDCs as their main\r\nobjective and are concessional in character and contain a grant element of at\r\nleast 25%, and other official flows (OOF) or transactions by the official sector\r\nwhose main objective is other than development motivated or whose grant element\r\nis below the 25% threshold for ODA. OOF transactions include official export\r\ncredits (such as Ex-Im Bank credits), official equity and portfolio investment,\r\nand debt reorganization by the official sector that does not meet concessional\r\nterms. Aid is considered to have been committed when agreements are initialed by\r\nthe parties involved and constitute a formal declaration of intent.\r\n\r\nEntities: Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special sovereignty,\r\nand governments included in this publication are not independent, and others are\r\nnot officially recognized by the US Government. \"Nation'' refers to a people\r\npolitically organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory.\r\n\"Dependent area\" refers to a broad category of political entities that are\r\nassociated in some way with a nation. Names used for page headings are usually\r\nthe short-form names as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names. There are\r\n266 entities in The World Factbook that may be categorized as follows:\r\n\r\nNATIONS\r\n\r\n182\r\nUN members (excluding the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia whose status\r\nin the UN is unclear)\r\n\r\n8\r\nnations that are not members of the UN--Andorra, Holy See, Kiribati, Nauru,\r\nSerbia and Montenegro, Switzerland, Tonga, Tuvalu\r\n\r\nOTHER\r\n\r\n1\r\nTaiwan\r\n\r\nDEPENDENT AREAS\r\n\r\n6\r\nAustralia--Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling)\r\nIslands, Coral Sea Islands, Heard Island and McDonald Islands, Norfolk Island\r\n\r\n2\r\nDenmark--Faroe Islands, Greenland\r\n\r\n16\r\nFrance--Bassas da India, Clipperton Island, Europa Island, French Guiana, French\r\nPolynesia, French Southern and Antarctic Lands, Glorioso Islands, Guadeloupe,\r\nJuan de Nova Island, Martinique, Mayotte, New Caledonia, Reunion, Saint Pierre\r\nand Miquelon, Tromelin Island, Wallis and Futuna\r\n\r\n2\r\nNetherlands--Aruba, Netherlands Antilles\r\n\r\n3\r\nNew Zealand--Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau\r\n\r\n3\r\nNorway--Bouvet Island, Jan Mayen, Svalbard\r\n\r\n1\r\nPortugal--Macau\r\n\r\n16\r\nUnited Kingdom--Anguilla, Bermuda, British Indian Ocean Territory, British\r\nVirgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Hong\r\nKong, Jersey, Isle of Man, Montserrat, Pitcairn Islands, Saint Helena, South\r\nGeorgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands\r\n\r\n15\r\nUnited States--American Samoa, Baker Island, Guam, Howland Island, Jarvis\r\nIsland, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Islands, Navassa Island, Northern\r\nMariana Islands, Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (Palau), Palmyra Atoll,\r\nPuerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Wake Island\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS\r\n\r\n6\r\nAntarctica, Gaza Strip, Paracel Islands, Spratly Islands, West Bank, Western\r\nSahara\r\n\r\nOTHER ENTITIES\r\n\r\n4\r\noceans--Arctic Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean\r\n\r\n1\r\nWorld\r\n\r\n266\r\ntotal\r\n\r\nnote: The US Government does not recognize the four so-called independent\r\nhomelands of Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, Transkei, and Venda in South Africa.\r\nExchange rate: The value of a nation's monetary unit at a given date or over a\r\ngiven period of time, as expressed in units of local currency per US dollar and\r\nas determined by international market forces or official fiat.\r\n\r\nGross domestic product (GDP): The value of all goods and services produced\r\ndomestically in a given year.\r\n\r\nGross national product (GNP): The value of all goods and services produced\r\ndomestically in a given year, plus income earned abroad, minus income earned by\r\nforeigners from domestic production.\r\n\r\nGross world product (GWP): The aggregate value of all goods and services\r\nproduced worldwide in a given year.\r\n\r\nGNP/GDP methodology: In the \"Economy'' section, GNP/GDP dollar estimates for the\r\nOECD countries, the former Soviet republics, and the East European countries are\r\nderived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations rather than from\r\nconversions at official currency exchange rates. The PPP method normally\r\ninvolves the use of international dollar price weights, which are applied to the\r\nquantities of goods and services produced in a given economy. In addition to the\r\nlack of reliable data from the majority of countries, the statistician faces a\r\nmajor difficulty in specifying, identifying, and allowing for the quality of\r\ngoods and services. The division of a PPP GNP/GDP estimate in dollars by the\r\ncorresponding estimate in the local currency gives the PPP conversion rate. One\r\nthousand dollars will buy the same market basket of goods in the US as one\r\nthousand dollars--converted to the local currency at the PPP conversion rate--\r\nwill buy in the other country. GNP/GDP estimates for the LDCs, on the other\r\nhand, are based on the conversion of GNP/GDP estimates in local currencies to\r\ndollars at the official currency exchange rates. Because currency exchange rates\r\ndepend on a variety of international and domestic financial forces that often\r\nhave little relation to domestic output, use of these rates is less satisfactory\r\nfor calculating GNP/GDP than the PPP method. Furthermore, exchange rates may\r\nsuddenly go up or down by 10% or more because of market forces or official fiat\r\nwhereas real output has remained unchanged. One additional caution: the\r\nproportion of, say, defense expenditures as a percent of GNP/GDP in local\r\ncurrency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when GNP/GDP\r\naccounts are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example, when an observer estimates\r\nthe dollar level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures; similar problems\r\nexist when components are expressed in dollars under currency exchange rate\r\nprocedures. Finally, as academic research moves forward on the PPP method, we\r\nhope to convert all GNP/GDP estimates to this method in future editions of The\r\nWorld Factbook.\r\n\r\nGrowth rate (population): The annual percent change in the population, resulting\r\nfrom a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of migrants\r\nentering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or negative.\r\n\r\nIllicit drugs: There are five categories of illicit drugs--narcotics,\r\nstimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and cannabis. These\r\ncategories include many drugs legally produced and prescribed by doctors as well\r\nas those illegally produced and sold outside medical channels.\r\n\r\nCannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides\r\nhallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana (pot,\r\nAcapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, Marinol), hashish\r\n(hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).\r\n\r\nCoca (Erythroxylon coca) is a bush, and the leaves contain the stimulant\r\ncocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa, which comes from cacao seeds and\r\nis used in making chocolate, cocoa, and cocoa butter.\r\n\r\nCocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.\r\n\r\nDepressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and include\r\nchloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal, phenobarbital),\r\nbenzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone (Quaalude), glutethimide\r\n(Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl, Valmid).\r\n\r\nDrugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental, emotional, or\r\nbehavioral change in an individual.\r\n\r\nDrug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that results in\r\nphysical,\r\nmental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an individual.\r\n\r\nHallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking, self-awareness, and\r\nemotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot), mescaline and peyote (mexc,\r\nbuttons, cactus), amphetamine variants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP,\r\nangel dust, hog), phencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others\r\n(psilocybin, psilocyn).\r\n\r\nHashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis sativa).\r\n\r\nHeroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.\r\n\r\nMarijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis sativa).\r\n\r\nNarcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to opium,\r\nopium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics include opium\r\n(paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol), codeine (Tylenol\r\nw/codeine, Empirin w/codeine, Robitussan AC), and thebaine. Semisynthetic\r\nnarcotics include heroin (horse, smack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic\r\nnarcotics include meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone\r\n(Dolophine, Methadose), and others (Darvon, Lomotil).\r\n\r\nOpium is the milky exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the opium poppy.\r\n\r\nOpium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for many natural and\r\nsemisynthetic narcotics.\r\n\r\nPoppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the mature dried opium\r\npoppy.\r\n\r\nQat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha edulis that is\r\nchewed or drunk as tea.\r\n\r\nStimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and activity,\r\nand include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines (Desoxyn, Dexedrine),\r\nphenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others (Cylert,\r\nSanorex, Tenuate).\r\n\r\nInfant mortality rate: The number of deaths to infants under one year old in a\r\ngiven year per l,000 live births occurring in the same year.\r\n\r\nInternational disputes: This category includes a wide variety of situations that\r\nrange from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral claims of one\r\nsort or another. Information regarding disputes over international boundaries\r\nand maritime boundaries has been reviewed by the Department of State. References\r\nto other situations may also be included that are border or frontier relevant,\r\nsuch as resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues.\r\nHowever, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance or\r\nrecognition by the US Government.\r\n\r\nIrrigated land: The figure refers to the number of km 2 that is artifically\r\nsupplied with water.\r\n\r\nLand use: Human use of the land surface is categorized as arable land--land\r\ncultivated for crops that are replanted after each harvest (wheat, maize, rice);\r\npermanent crops--land cultivated for crops that are not replanted after each\r\nharvest (citrus, coffee, rubber); meadows and pastures--land permanently used\r\nfor herbaceous forage crops; forest and woodland land--under dense or open\r\nstands of trees; and other--any land type not specifically mentioned above\r\n(urban areas, roads, desert).\r\n\r\nLeaders: The chief of state is the titular leader of the country who represents\r\nthe state at official and ceremonial funcions but is not involved with the day-\r\nto-day activities of the government. The head of government is the\r\nadministrative leader who manages the day-to-day activities of the government.\r\nIn the UK, the monarch is the chief of state, and the Prime Minister is the head\r\nof government. In the US, the President is both the chief of state and the head\r\nof government.\r\n\r\nLife expectancy at birth: The average number of years to be lived by a group of\r\npeople all born in the same year, if mortality at each age remains constant in\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nLiteracy: There are no universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless\r\notherwise noted, all rates are based on the most common definition--the ability\r\nto read and write at a specified age. Detailing the standards that individual\r\ncountries use to assess the ability to read and write is beyond the scope of\r\nthis publication.\r\n\r\nMaps: All maps will be available only in the printed version of The World\r\nFactbook for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: The proximity of neighboring states may prevent some national\r\nclaims from being extended the full distance.\r\n\r\nMerchant marine: All ships engaged in the carriage of goods. All commercial\r\nvessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships), which excludes tugs, fishing\r\nvessels, offshore oil rigs, etc.; also, a grouping of merchant ships by\r\nnationality or register.\r\n\r\nCaptive register--A register of ships maintained by a territory, possession, or\r\ncolony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships owned in the parent\r\ncountry; also referred to as an offshore register, the offshore equivalent of an\r\ninternal register. Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag as the\r\nparent country, or a local variant of it, but will be subject to the maritime\r\nlaws and taxation rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature of a\r\ncaptive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent\r\ncountry, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be owned abroad.\r\nThe captive register then acts as a flag of convenience register, except that it\r\nis not the register of an independent state.\r\n\r\nFlag of convenience register--A national register offering registration to a\r\nmerchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major flags of convenience (FOC)\r\nattract ships to their register by virtue of low fees, low or nonexistent\r\ntaxation of profits, and liberal manning requirements. True FOC registers are\r\ncharacterized by having relatively few of the ships registered actually owned in\r\nthe flag state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a\r\ngiven set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority of the\r\nmerchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an open register.\r\n\r\nFlag state--The nation in which a ship is registered and which holds legal\r\njurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or abroad. Differences\r\nin flag state maritime legislation determine how a ship is manned and taxed and\r\nwhether a foreign-owned ship may be placed on the register.\r\n\r\nInternal register--A register of ships maintained as a subset of a national\r\nregister. Ships on the internal register fly the national flag and have that\r\nnationality but are subject to a separate set of maritime rules from those on\r\nthe main national register. These differences usually include lower taxation of\r\nprofits, manning by foreign nationals, and, usually, ownership outside the flag\r\nstate (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian International Ship\r\nRegister and Danish International Ship Register are the most notable examples of\r\nan internal register. Both have been instrumental in stemming flight from the\r\nnational flag to flags of convenience and in attracting foreignowned ships to\r\nthe Norwegian and Danish flags.\r\n\r\nMerchant ship--A vessel that carries goods against payment of freight; commonly\r\nused to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately restricted to commercial\r\nvessels only.\r\n\r\nRegister--The record of a ship's ownership and nationality as listed with the\r\nmaritime authorities of a country; also, the compendium of such individual\r\nships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides it with a nationality and\r\nmakes it subject to the laws of the country in which registered (the flag state)\r\nregardless of the nationality of the ship's ultimate owner.\r\n\r\nMoney figures: All are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars unless otherwise\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nNational product: The total output of goods and services in a country in a given\r\nyear. See Gross domestic product (GDP), Gross national product (GNP), and\r\nGNP/GDP methodology.\r\n\r\nNet migration rate: The balance between the number of persons entering and\r\nleaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear\r\npopulation). An excess of persons entering the country is referred to as net\r\nimmigration (3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the\r\ncountry as net emigration (-9.26 migrants/1,000 population).\r\n\r\nPopulation: Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census based on\r\nstatistics from population censuses, vital registration systems, or sample\r\nsurveys pertaining to the recent past, and on assumptions about future trends.\r\n\r\nTotal fertility rate: The average number of children that would be born per\r\nwoman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years and bore\r\nchildren according to a given fertility rate at each age.\r\n\r\nYears: All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless indicated as\r\nfiscal year (FY).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD FACTBOOK 1993\r\n\r\n*Afghanistan, Geography\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\n  South Asia, between Iran and Pakistan\r\nMap references:\r\n  Asia, Middle East, Standard Time Zones of the World\r\nArea:\r\n total area:\r\n  647,500 km2\r\n land area:\r\n  647,500 km2\r\n comparative area:\r\n  slightly smaller than Texas\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total 5,529 km, China 76 km, Iran 936 km, Pakistan 2,430 km, Tajikistan\r\n  1,206 km, Turkmenistan 744 km, Uzbekistan 137 km\r\nCoastline:\r\n  0 km (landlocked)\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n  none;

Economic considerations have played second fiddle to political and\r\n  military upheavals during more than 13 years of war, including the nearly\r\n  10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended 15 February 1989). Over the\r\n  past decade, one-third of the population fled the country, with Pakistan\r\n  sheltering more than 3 million refugees and Iran about 1.3 million. Another\r\n  1 million probably moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan.\r\n  Although reliable data are unavailable, gross domestic product is lower than\r\n  12 years ago because of the loss of labor and capital and the disruption of\r\n  trade and transport.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $3 billion (1989 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $200 (1989 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  over 90% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $NA;

For over\r\n  40 years, the Stalinist-type economy operated on the principle of central\r\n  planning and state ownership of the means of production. Fitful economic\r\n  reforms begun during 1991, including the liberalization of prices and trade,\r\n  the privatization of shops and transport, and land reform, were crippled by\r\n  widespread civil disorder. Following its overwhelming victory in the 22\r\n  March 1992 elections, the new Democratic government announced a program of\r\n  shock therapy to stabilize the economy and establish a market economy. In an\r\n  effort to expand international ties, Tirane has reestablished diplomatic\r\n  relations with the major republics of the former Soviet Union and the US and\r\n  has joined the IMF and the World Bank. The Albanians have also passed\r\n  legislation allowing foreign investment, but not foreign ownership of real\r\n  estate. Albania possesses considerable mineral resources and, until 1990,\r\n  was largely self-sufficient in food; however, the breakup of cooperative\r\n  farms in 1991 and general economic decline forced Albania to rely on foreign\r\n  aid to maintain adequate supplies. In 1992 the government tightened\r\n  budgetary contols leading to another drop in domestic output. The\r\n  agricultural sector is steadily gaining from the privatization process. Low\r\n  domestic output is supplemented by remittances from the 200,000 Albanians\r\n  working abroad.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $2.5 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -10% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $760 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  210% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  40% (1992 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $1.1 billion;

In 1973-74 the sharp increase in\r\n  oil prices led to a booming economy and helped to finance an ambitious\r\n  program of industrialization. Plunging oil and gas prices, combined with the\r\n  mismanagement of Algeria's highly centralized economy, has brought the\r\n  nation to its most serious social and economic crisis since full\r\n  independence in 1988.

An estimated 13 million\r\n  tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its\r\n  summer and winter resorts. The banking sector, with its \"tax haven\" status,\r\n  also contributes significantly to the economy. Agricultural production is\r\n  limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food has to be imported. The\r\n  principal livestock activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing consists mainly\r\n  of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture. Although it is a member of the EC\r\n  customs union, it is unclear what effect the European Single Market will\r\n  have on the advantages Andorra obtains from its duty-free status.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $760 million (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $14,000 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  NA%\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  0%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $119.4 million;

Oil production is vital\r\n  to the economy, contributing about 60% to GDP. Bitter internal fighting\r\n  continues to severely affect the nonoil economy, and food needs to be\r\n  imported. For the long run, Angola has the advantage of rich natural\r\n  resources in addition to oil, notably gold, diamonds, and arable land. To\r\n  realize its economic potential Angola not only must secure domestic peace\r\n  but also must reform government policies that have led to distortions and\r\n  imbalances throughout the economy.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $5.1 billion (1991 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1.7% (1991 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $950 (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  1,000% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $2.1 billion;

The Departments of Treasury, Commerce, Transportation,\r\n  and Interior share enforcement responsibilities. Public Law 95-541, the US\r\n  Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978, requires expeditions from the US to\r\n  Antarctica to notify, in advance, the Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs,\r\n  Room 5801, Department of State, Washington, DC 20520, which reports such\r\n  plans to other nations as required by the Antarctic Treaty.

Argentina's currency has traded at par with the US\r\n  dollar since April 1991, and inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 20\r\n  years. Argentines have responded to the relative price stability by\r\n  repatriating flight capital and investing in domestic industry. Much remains\r\n  to be done in the 1990s in dismantling the old statist barriers to growth\r\n  and in solidifying the recent economic gains.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $112 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  7% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $3,400 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  17.7% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  6.9% (1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $33.1 billion;

In turn, Armenia had depended on supplies of raw materials\r\n  and energy from the other republics. Most of these supplies enter the\r\n  republic by rail through Azerbaijan (85%) and Georgia (15%). The economy has\r\n  been severely hurt by ethnic strife with Azerbaijan over control of the\r\n  Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, a mostly Armenian-populated enclave\r\n  within the national boundaries of Azerbaijan. In addition to outright\r\n  warfare, the strife has included interdiction of Armenian imports on the\r\n  Azerbaijani railroads and expensive airlifts of supplies to beleaguered\r\n  Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. An earthquake in December 1988 destroyed\r\n  about one-tenth of industrial capacity and housing, the repair of which has\r\n  not been possible because the supply of funds and real resources has been\r\n  disrupted by the reorganization and subsequent dismantling of the central\r\n  USSR administrative apparatus. Among facilities made unserviceable by the\r\n  earthquake are the Yerevan nuclear power plant, which had supplied 40% of\r\n  Armenia's needs for electric power and a plant that produced one-quarter of\r\n  the output of elevators in the former USSR. Armenia has some deposits of\r\n  nonferrous metal ores (bauxite, copper, zinc, and molybdenum) that are\r\n  largely unexploited. For the mid-term, Armenia's economic prospects seem\r\n  particularly bleak because of ethnic strife and the unusually high\r\n  dependence on outside areas, themselves in a chaotic state of\r\n  transformation. The dramatic drop in output in 1992 is attributable largely\r\n  to the cumulative impact of the blockade; of particular importance was the\r\n  shutting off in the summer of 1992 of rail and road links to Russia through\r\n  Georgia due to civil strife in the latter republic.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP $NA\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -34% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $NA\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  20% per month (first quarter 1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  2% of officially registered unemployed but large numbers of underemployed\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $NA;

Increased export sales resulting from German unification,\r\n  continued to boost Austria's economy through 1991. However, Germany's\r\n  economic difficulties in 1992 slowed Austria's GDP growth to 2% from the 3%\r\n  of 1991. Austria's economy, moreover, is not expected to grow by more than\r\n  1% in 1993, and inflation is forecast to remain about 4%. Unemployment will\r\n  likely remain at current levels at least until 1994. Living standards in\r\n  Austria are comparable with the large industrial countries of Western\r\n  Europe. Problems for the l990s include an aging population, the high level\r\n  of subsidies, and the struggle to keep welfare benefits within budgetary\r\n  capabilities. The continued opening of Eastern European markets, however,\r\n  will increase demand for Austrian exports. Austria, a member of the European\r\n  Free Trade Association (EFTA), in 1992 ratified the European Economic Area\r\n  Treaty, which will extend European Community rules on the free movement of\r\n  people, goods, capital and services to the EFTA countries, and Austrians\r\n  plan to hold a national referendum within the next two years to vote on EC\r\n  membership.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $141.3 billion (1992)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1.8% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $18,000 (1992)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  4% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  6.4% (1992 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $47.8 billion;

It resembles the Central Asian states in\r\n  its majority Muslim population, high structural unemployment, and low\r\n  standard of living. The economy's most prominent products are cotton, oil,\r\n  and gas. Production from the Caspian oil and gas field has been in decline\r\n  for several years. With foreign assistance, the oil industry might generate\r\n  the funds needed to spur industrial development. However, civil unrest,\r\n  marked by armed conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region between Muslim\r\n  Azeris and Christian Armenians, makes foreign investors wary. Azerbaijan\r\n  accounted for 1.5% to 2% of the capital stock and output of the former\r\n  Soviet Union. Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the ex-Soviet\r\n  republics in making the transition from a command to a market economy, but\r\n  its considerable energy resources brighten its propects somewhat. Old\r\n  economic ties and structures have yet to be replaced. A particularly galling\r\n  constraint on economic revival is the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, said to\r\n  consume 25% of Azerbaijan's economic resources.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP $NA\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -25% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $NA\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  20% per month (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  0.2% includes officially registered unemployed;

Its economy is overwhelmingly agricultural. Major\r\n  impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and floods, government\r\n  interference with the economy, a rapidly growing labor force that cannot be\r\n  absorbed by agriculture, a low level of industrialization, failure to fully\r\n  exploit energy resources (natural gas), and inefficient and inadequate power\r\n  supplies. An excellent rice crop and expansion of the export garment\r\n  industry helped growth in FY91/92. Policy reforms intended to reduce\r\n  government regulation of private industry and promote public-sector\r\n  efficiency have been announced but are being implemented only slowly.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $23.8 billion (FY92)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  3.8% (FY92)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $200 (FY92)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  5.09% (FY92)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $2.5 billion;

In recent years, however, the economy has diversified\r\n  into manufacturing and tourism. The tourist industry is now a major employer\r\n  of the labor force and a primary source of foreign exchange. The economy\r\n  slowed in 1990-91, however, and Bridgetown's declining hard currency\r\n  reserves and inability to finance its deficits have caused it to adopt an\r\n  austere economic reform program.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $1.8 billion ( 1991)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -4% (1991)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $7,000 (1991)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  8.1% (1991)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  23% (1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $547 million;

Belarus ranks fourth in gross output among the former Soviet\r\n  republics, having produced 4% of the total GDP and employing 4% of the labor\r\n  force in the old USSR. Once a mainly agricultural area, it now supplies\r\n  important producer and consumer goods - sometimes as the sole producer - to\r\n  the other states. Belarus had a significant share of the machine-building\r\n  capacity of the former USSR. It is especially noted for production of\r\n  tractors, large trucks, machine tools, and automation equipment. The soil in\r\n  Belarus is not as fertile as the black earth of Ukraine, but by emphasizing\r\n  favorable crops and livestock (especially pigs and chickens), Belarus has\r\n  become a net exporter to the other former republics of meat, milk, eggs,\r\n  flour, and potatoes. Belarus produces only small amounts of oil and gas and\r\n  receives most of its fuel from Russia through the Druzhba oil pipeline and\r\n  the Northern Lights gas pipeline. These pipelines transit Belarus en route\r\n  to Eastern Europe. Belarus produces petrochemicals, plastics, synthetic\r\n  fibers (nearly 30% of former Soviet output), and fertilizer (20% of former\r\n  Soviet output). Raw material resources are limited to potash and peat\r\n  deposits. The peat (more than one-third of the total for the former Soviet\r\n  Union) is used in domestic heating, as boiler fuel for electric power\r\n  stations, and in the production of chemicals. The potash supports fertilizer\r\n  production. In 1992 GDP fell an estimated 13%, largely because the country\r\n  is highly dependent on the ailing Russian economy for raw materials and\r\n  parts.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP $NA\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -13% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $NA\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  30% per month (first quarter 1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  0.5% of officially registered unemployed;

Industry is concentrated mainly in the\r\n  populous Flemish area in the north, although the government is encouraging\r\n  reinvestment in the southern region of Walloon. With few natural resources\r\n  Belgium must import essential raw materials, making its economy closely\r\n  dependent on the state of world markets. Over 70% of trade is with other EC\r\n  countries. The economy grew at a strong 4% pace during the period 1988-90,\r\n  but economic growth slowed to a 1% pace in 1991-92. The economy is expected\r\n  to turn in another sluggish 1% performance in 1993.

Rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make\r\n  the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. The\r\n  economy is closely aligned with that of India through strong trade and\r\n  monetary links. The industrial sector is small and technologically backward,\r\n  with most production of the cottage industry type. Most development\r\n  projects, such as road construction, rely on Indian migrant labor.

Although agriculture has been almost all in\r\n  private hands, farms have been small and inefficient, and the republic\r\n  traditionally has been a net importer of food. Industry has been greatly\r\n  overstaffed, one reflection of the rigidities of Communist central planning\r\n  and management. Tito had pushed the development of military industries in\r\n  the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted a large share of\r\n  Yugoslavia's defense plants. As of March 1993, Bosnia and Herzegovina was\r\n  being torn apart by the continued bitter interethnic warfare that has caused\r\n  production to plummet, unemployment and inflation to soar, and human misery\r\n  to multiply. No reliable economic statistics for 1992 are available,\r\n  although output clearly fell below the already depressed 1991 level.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $14 billion (1991 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -37% (1991 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $3,200 (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  80% per month (1991)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  28% (February 1992 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $NA;

The driving force behind the\r\n  rapid economic growth of the 1970s and 1980s has been the mining industry.\r\n  This sector, mostly on the strength of diamonds, has gone from generating\r\n  25% of GDP in 1980 to 50% in 1991. No other sector has experienced such\r\n  growth, especially not agriculture, which is plagued by erratic rainfall and\r\n  poor soils. The unemployment rate remains a problem at 25%. Although diamond\r\n  production was down slightly in 1992, substantial gains in coal output and\r\n  manufacturing helped boost the economy\r\nNational product:   GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $3.6 billion (FY92 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  5.8% (FY92 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $2,450 (FY92 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  16.5% (December 1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  25% (1989)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $1.7 billion;

In addition,\r\n  the economy remained highly regulated, inward-looking, and protected by\r\n  substantial trade and investment barriers. Ownership of major industrial and\r\n  mining facilities is divided among private interests - including several\r\n  multinationals - and the government. Most large agricultural holdings are\r\n  private, with the government channeling financing to this sector. Conflicts\r\n  between large landholders and landless peasants have produced intermittent\r\n  violence. The COLLOR government, which assumed office in March 1990,\r\n  launched an ambitious reform program that sought to modernize and\r\n  reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices, deregulating the economy,\r\n  and opening it to increased foreign competition. The government also\r\n  obtained an IMF standby loan in January 1992 and reached agreements with\r\n  commercial bankers on the repayment of interest arrears and on the reduction\r\n  of debt and debt service payments. Galloping inflation - the rate doubled in\r\n  1992 - continues to undermine economic stability. Itamar FRANCO, who assumed\r\n  the presidency following President COLLOR'S resignation in December 1992,\r\n  has promised to support the basic premises of COLLOR'S reform program but\r\n  has yet to define clearly his economic policies.

By 1990, Sofia's foreign debt had skyrocketed to over $10 billion\r\n  - giving a debt-service ratio of more than 40% of hard currency earnings and\r\n  leading the regime to declare a moratorium on its hard currency payments.\r\n  The post-Communist government faces major problems of renovating an aging\r\n  industrial plant; keeping abreast of rapidly unfolding technological\r\n  developments; investing in additional energy capacity (the portion of\r\n  electric power from nuclear energy reached over one-third in 1990); and\r\n  motivating workers, in part by giving them a share in the earnings of their\r\n  enterprises. Political bickering in Sofia and the collapse of the DIMITROV\r\n  government in October 1992 have slowed the economic reform process. New\r\n  Prime Minister BEROV, however, has pledged to continue the reforms initiated\r\n  by the previous government. He has promised to continue cooperation with the\r\n  World Bank and IMF, advance negotiations on rescheduling commercial debt,\r\n  and push ahead with privatization. BEROV's government - whose main\r\n  parliamentary supporters are the former Communist Bulgarian Socialist Party\r\n  (BSP) - nonetheless appears likely to pursue more interventionist tactics in\r\n  overcoming the country's economic problems.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $34.1 billion (1992)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -7.7% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $3,800 (1992)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  80% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  15% (1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $8 billion;

The\r\n  nation has been unable to achieve any substantial improvement in export\r\n  earnings because of falling prices for many of its major commodity exports.\r\n  For rice, traditionally the most important export, the drop in world prices\r\n  has been accompanied by shrinking markets and a smaller volume of sales. In\r\n  1985 teak replaced rice as the largest export and continues to hold this\r\n  position. The economy is heavily dependent on the agricultural sector, which\r\n  generates about 40% of GDP and provides employment for 65% of the work\r\n  force. Burma has been largely isolated from international economic forces\r\n  and has been trying to encourage foreign investment, so far with little\r\n  success.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $28 billion (1992)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1.3% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $660 (1992)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  50% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  9.6% (FY89 est.) in urban areas\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $8.1 billion;

Its economic health depends on the coffee crop, which accounts\r\n  for an average 90% of foreign exchange earnings each year. The ability to\r\n  pay for imports therefore continues to rest largely on the vagaries of the\r\n  climate and the international coffee market. As part of its economic reform\r\n  agenda, launched in February 1991 with IMF and World Bank support, Burundi\r\n  is trying to diversify its agricultural exports and attract foreign\r\n  investment in industry. Several state-owned coffee companies were privatized\r\n  via public auction in September 1991.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $1.23 billion (1991 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  5% (1991 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $205 (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  9% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $318 million;

The\r\n  country's immediate economic challenge is an acute financial crisis that is\r\n  undermining monetary stability and preventing disbursement of foreign\r\n  development assistance. Cambodia is still recovering from an abrupt shift in\r\n  1990 to free-market economic mechanisms and a cutoff in aid from former\r\n  Soviet bloc countries; these changes have severely impacted on public sector\r\n  revenues and performance. The country's infrastructure of roads, bridges,\r\n  and power plants has been severely degraded, now having only 40-50% of\r\n  prewar capacity. The economy remains essentially rural, with 90% of the\r\n  population living in the countryside and dependent mainly on subsistence\r\n  agriculture. Statistical data on the economy continue to be sparse and\r\n  unreliable.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $2 billion (1991 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $280 (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  250-300% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $120 million;

Still, it faces many of the serious\r\n  problems facing other underdeveloped countries, such as political\r\n  instability, a top-heavy civil service, and a generally unfavorable climate\r\n  for business enterprise. The development of the oil sector led rapid\r\n  economic growth between 1970 and 1985. Growth came to an abrupt halt in 1986\r\n  precipitated by steep declines in the prices of major exports: coffee,\r\n  cocoa, and petroleum. Export earnings were cut by almost one-third, and\r\n  inefficiencies in fiscal management were exposed. In 1990-92, with support\r\n  from the IMF and World Bank, the government has begun to introduce reforms\r\n  designed to spur business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture,\r\n  and recapitalize the nation's banks. Nationwide strikes organized by\r\n  opposition parties in 1991, however, undermined these efforts.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $11.5 billion (1990 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  3% (1990 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,040 (1990 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  3% (1990 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  25% (1990 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $1.7 billion;

Since World War II the impressive growth of the manufacturing,\r\n  mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural\r\n  economy into one primarily industrial and urban. In the 1980s, Canada\r\n  registered one of the highest rates of real growth among the OECD nations,\r\n  averaging about 3.2%. With its great natural resources, skilled labor force,\r\n  and modern capital plant, Canada has excellent economic prospects.

The economy is service\r\n  oriented, with commerce, transport, and public services accounting for 60%\r\n  of GDP. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in rural areas,\r\n  agriculture's share of GDP is only 16%; the fishing sector accounts for 4%.\r\n  About 90% of food must be imported. The fishing potential, mostly lobster\r\n  and tuna, is not fully exploited. In 1988 fishing represented only 3.5% of\r\n  GDP. Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by remittances\r\n  from emigrants and foreign aid. Economic reforms launched by the new\r\n  democratic government in February 1991 are aimed at developing the private\r\n  sector and attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $310 million (1990 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  4% (1990 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $800 (1990 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  8.7% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  25% (1988)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $104 million;

largely subsistence farming;\r\n  bananas are the only export crop; other crops - corn, beans, sweet potatoes,\r\n  coffee; growth potential of agricultural sector limited by poor soils and\r\n  scanty rainfall;

In 1986 real GDP returned to its 1977 level,\r\n  with cotton, the major cash crop, accounting for 48% of exports. Over 80% of\r\n  the work force is employed in subsistence farming and fishing. Industry is\r\n  based almost entirely on the processing of agricultural products, including\r\n  cotton, sugarcane, and cattle. Chad is highly dependent on foreign aid, with\r\n  its economy in trouble and many regions suffering from shortages. Oil\r\n  companies are exploring areas north of Lake Chad and in the Doba basin in\r\n  the south.

In 1991 growth in GDP recovered to 6% (led by\r\n  consumer spending) after only 2% growth in 1990. The pace accelerated in\r\n  1992 as the result of strong investment and export growth, and GDP rose\r\n  10.4%. Nonetheless, inflation fell further, to 12.7%, compared with 27.3% in\r\n  1990 and 18.7% in 1991. The buoyant economy spurred a 25% growth in imports,\r\n  and the trade surplus fell in 1992, although international reserves\r\n  increased. Inflationary pressures are not expected to ease much in 1993, and\r\n  economic growth is likely to approach 7%.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $34.7 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:   10.4% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $2,550 (1992)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  12.7% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  4.9% (1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $10.9 billion;

To this end the authorities have\r\n  switched to a system of household responsibility in agriculture in place of\r\n  the old collectivization, increased the authority of local officials and\r\n  plant managers in industry, permitted a wide variety of small-scale\r\n  enterprise in services and light manufacturing, and opened the foreign\r\n  economic sector to increased trade and joint ventures. The most gratifying\r\n  result has been a strong spurt in production, particularly in agriculture in\r\n  the early 1980s. Industry also has posted major gains, especially in coastal\r\n  areas near Hong Kong and opposite Taiwan, where foreign investment and\r\n  modern production methods have helped spur production of both domestic and\r\n  export goods. Aggregate output has more than doubled since 1978. On the\r\n  darker side, the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid system the\r\n  worst results of socialism (bureaucracy, lassitude, corruption) and of\r\n  capitalism (windfall gains and stepped-up inflation). Beijing thus has\r\n  periodically backtracked, retightening central controls at intervals and\r\n  thereby lessening the credibility of the reform process. In 1991, and again\r\n  in 1992, output rose substantially, particularly in the favored coastal\r\n  areas. Popular resistance, changes in central policy, and loss of authority\r\n  by rural cadres have weakened China's population control program, which is\r\n  essential to the nation's long-term economic viability.\r\nNational product:   GNP $NA\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  12.8% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $NA\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  5.4% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  2.3% in urban areas (1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n  deficit $16.3 billion (1992)\r\nExports:\r\n  $85.0 billion (f.o.b., 1992)\r\n commodities:\r\n  textiles, garments, telecommunications and recording equipment, petroleum,\r\n  minerals\r\n partners:\r\n  Hong Kong and Macau, Japan, US, Germany, South Korea, Russia (1992)\r\nImports:\r\n  $80.6 billion (c.i.f., 1992)\r\n commodities:\r\n  specialized industrial machinery, chemicals, manufactured goods, steel,\r\n  textile yarn, fertilizer\r\n partners:\r\n  Hong Kong and Macau, Japan, US, Taiwan, Germany, Russia (1992)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $69.3 billion (1992)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 20.8% (1992)\r\nElectricity:\r\n  158,690,000 kW capacity;

Conservative economic policies have\r\n  kept inflation and unemployment near 30% and 10%, respectively. The rapid\r\n  development of oil, coal, and other nontraditional industries in recent\r\n  years has helped to offset the decline in coffee prices - Colombia's major\r\n  export. The collapse of the International Coffee Agreement in the summer of\r\n  1989, a troublesome rural insurgency, energy rationing, and drug-related\r\n  violence have dampened growth. The level of violence, in Bogota in\r\n  particular, surged to higher levels in the first quarter of 1993, further\r\n  delaying the economic resurgence expected from government reforms. These\r\n  reforms center on fiscal restraint, trade and investment liberalization,\r\n  financial and labor reform, and privatization of state utilities and\r\n  commercial banks.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $51 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  3.3% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,500 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  25% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  10% (1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $5.0 billion;

The low educational level of the\r\n  labor force contributes to a low level of economic activity, high\r\n  unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical\r\n  assistance. Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the\r\n  leading sector of the economy. It contributes 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the\r\n  labor force, and provides most of the exports. The country is not\r\n  self-sufficient in food production, and rice, the main staple, accounts for\r\n  90% of imports. During the period 1982-86 the industrial sector grew at an\r\n  annual average rate of 5.3%, but its contribution to GDP was only 5% in\r\n  1988. Despite major investment in the tourist industry, which accounts for\r\n  about 25% of GDP, growth has stagnated since 1983. A sluggish growth rate of\r\n  1.5% during 1985-90 has led to large budget deficits, declining incomes, and\r\n  balance-of-payments difficulties.

A reform\r\n  program, supported by the IMF and World Bank, ran into difficulties in\r\n  1990-91 because of problems in changing to a democratic political regime and\r\n  a heavy debt-servicing burden. Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay\r\n  of the economy, providing about two-thirds of government revenues and\r\n  exports. In the early 1980s rapidly rising oil revenues enabled Congo to\r\n  finance large-scale development projects with growth averaging 5% annually,\r\n  one of the highest rates in Africa. During the period 1987-91, however,\r\n  growth has slowed to an average of roughly 1.5% annually, only half the\r\n  population growth rate. The new government, responding to pressure from\r\n  businessmen and the electorate, has promised to reduce the bureaucracy and\r\n  government regulation but little has been accomplished as of early 1993.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $2.5 billion (1991 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  0.6% (1991 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,070 (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  -0.6% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $765 million;

Consequently, the economy is\r\n  highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for coffee and\r\n  cocoa and to weather conditions. Despite attempts by the government to\r\n  diversify, the economy is still largely dependent on agriculture and related\r\n  industries. The agricultural sector accounts for over one-third of GDP and\r\n  about 80% of export earnings and employs about 85% of the labor force. A\r\n  collapse of world cocoa and coffee prices in 1986 threw the economy into a\r\n  recession, from which the country had not recovered by 1990. Continuing low\r\n  prices for commodity exports, an overvalued exchange rate, a bloated\r\n  public-sector wage bill, and a large foreign debt hindered economic recovery\r\n  in 1991.

Croatian Serb Nationalists control approximately one\r\n  third of the Croatian territory, and one of the overriding determinants of\r\n  Croatia's long-term political and economic prospects will be the resolution\r\n  of this territorial dispute. Croatia faces monumental problems stemming\r\n  from: the legacy of longtime Communist mismanagement of the economy; large\r\n  foreign debt; damage during the fighting to bridges, factories, powerlines,\r\n  buildings, and houses; the large refugee population, both Croatian and\r\n  Bosnian; and the disruption of economic ties to Serbia and the other former\r\n  Yugoslav republics, as well as within its own territory. At the minimum,\r\n  extensive Western aid and investment, especially in the tourist and oil\r\n  industries, would seem necessary to salvage a desperate economic situation.\r\n  However, peace and political stability must come first. As of June 1993,\r\n  fighting continues among Croats, Serbs, and Muslims, and national boundaries\r\n  and final political arrangements are still in doubt.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $26.3 billion (1991 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -25% (1991 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $5,600 (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  50% (monthly rate, December 1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  20% (December 1991 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $NA;

most agricultural land in private\r\n  hands and concentrated in Croat-majority districts in Slavonia and Istria;\r\n  much of Slavonia's land has been put out of production by fighting; wheat,\r\n  corn, sugar beets, sunflowers, alfalfa, and clover are main crops in\r\n  Slavonia;

Thus, Cuba, like the former Warsaw Pact nations, has\r\n  remained in the backwater of economic modernization. The economy contracted\r\n  by about one-third between 1989 and 1992 as it absorbed the loss of $4\r\n  billion of annual economic aid from the former Soviet Union and much smaller\r\n  amounts from Eastern Europe. The government implemented numerous energy\r\n  conservation measures and import substitution schemes to cope with a large\r\n  decline in imports. To reduce fuel consumption, Havana has cut back bus\r\n  service and imported approximately 1 million bicycles from China,\r\n  domesticated nearly 200,000 oxen to replace tractors, and halted a large\r\n  amount of industrial production. The government has prioritized domestic\r\n  food production and promoted herbal medicines since 1990 to compensate for\r\n  lower imports. Havana also has been shifting its trade away from the former\r\n  Soviet republics and Eastern Europe toward the industrialized countries of\r\n  Latin America and the OECD.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GNP - exchange rate conversion - $14.9 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -15% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,370 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  NA%\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $12.46 billion;

Industry\r\n  contributes 16.5% to GDP and employs 29% of the labor force, while the\r\n  service sector contributes 62% to GDP and employs 57% of the labor force.\r\n  Rapid growth in exports of agricultural and manufactured products and in\r\n  tourism have played important roles in the average 6.8% rise in GDP between\r\n  1986 and 1990. This progress was temporarily checked in 1991, because of the\r\n  adverse effects of the Gulf War on tourism. Nevertheless in mid-1991, the\r\n  World Bank \"graduated\" Cyprus off its list of developing countries. In\r\n  contrast to the bright picture in the south, the Turkish Cypriot economy has\r\n  less than half the per capita GDP and suffered a series of reverses in 1991.\r\n  Crippled by the effects of the Gulf war, the collapse of the\r\n  fruit-to-electronics conglomerate, Polly Peck, Ltd., and a drought, the\r\n  Turkish area in late 1991 asked for a multibillion-dollar grant from Turkey\r\n  to help ease the burden of the economic crisis. In addition, the Turkish\r\n  government extended a $100 million loan in November 1992 to be used for\r\n  economic development projects in 1993. Turkey normally underwrites a\r\n  substantial portion of the Turkish Cypriot economy.\r\nNational product:\r\n Greek area:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $6.3 billion (1992)\r\n Turkish area:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $600 million (1990)\r\nNational product real growth rate:  Greek area:\r\n  6.5% (1992)\r\n Turkish area:\r\n  5.9% (1990)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n Greek area:\r\n  $11,000 (1992)\r\n Turkish area:\r\n  $4,000 (1990)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n Greek area:\r\n  5.1% (1991)\r\n Turkish area:\r\n  69.4% (1990)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n Greek area:\r\n  2.4% (1991)\r\n Turkish area:\r\n  1.5% (1991)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $1.7 billion;

The old Czechoslovakia,\r\n  even though highly industrialized by East European standards, suffered from\r\n  an aging capital plant, lagging technology, and a deficiency in energy and\r\n  many raw materials. In January 1991, approximately one year after the end of\r\n  communist control of Eastern Europe, theCzech and Slovak Federal Republic\r\n  launched a sweeping program to convert its almost entirely state-owned and\r\n  controlled economy to a market system. In 1991-92 these measures resulted in\r\n  privatization of some medium- and small-scale economic activity and the\r\n  setting of more than 90% of prices by the market - but at a cost in\r\n  inflation, unemployment, and lower output. For Czechoslovakia as a whole\r\n  inflation in 1991 was roughly 50% and output fell 15%. In 1992, in the Czech\r\n  lands, inflation dropped to an estimated 12.5% and GDP was down a more\r\n  moderate 5%. For 1993 the government of the Czech Republic anticipates\r\n  inflation of 15-20% and a rise in unemployment to perhaps 12% as some\r\n  large-scale enterprises go into bankruptcy; GDP may drop as much as 3%,\r\n  mainly because of the disruption of trade links with Slovakia. Although the\r\n  governments of the Czech Republic and Slovakia had envisaged retaining the\r\n  koruna as a common currency, at least in the short term, the two countries\r\n  ended the currency union in February 1993.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $75.3 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -5% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $7,300 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  12.5% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  3.1% (1992 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $NA;

Denmark's new\r\n  center-left coalition government will concentrate on reducing the persistent\r\n  high unemployment rate and the budget deficit as well as following the\r\n  previous government's policies of maintaining low inflation and a current\r\n  account surplus. In the face of recent international market pressure on the\r\n  Danish krone, the coalition has also vowed to maintain a stable currency.\r\n  The coalition hopes to lower marginal income taxes while maintaining overall\r\n  tax revenues; boost industrial competitiveness through labor market and tax\r\n  reforms and increased research and development funds; and improve welfare\r\n  services for the neediest while cutting paperwork and delays. Prime Minister\r\n  RASMUSSEN's reforms will focus on adapting Denmark to EC's economic and\r\n  monetary union (EMU) criteria by 1999, although Copenhagen won from the EC\r\n  the right to opt out of the EMU if a national referendum rejects it. Denmark\r\n  is, in fact, one of the few EC countries likely to fit into the EMU on time.\r\n  Denmark is weathering the current worldwide slump better than many West\r\n  European countries. As the EC's single market (formally established on 1\r\n  January 1993) gets underway, Danish economic growth is expected to pickup to\r\n  around 2% in 1993. Expected Danish approval of the Maastricht treaty on EC\r\n  political and economic union in May 1993 would almost certainly reverse the\r\n  drop in investment, further boosting growth. The current account surplus\r\n  remains strong as limitations on wage increases and low inflation - expected\r\n  to be around 1% in 1993 - improve export competitiveness. Although\r\n  unemployment is high, it remains stable compared to most European countries.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $94.2 billion (1992)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $18,200 (1992)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):   1.5% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  11.4% (1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $48.8 billion;

It has few natural\r\n  resources and little industry. The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent\r\n  on foreign assistance to help support its balance of payments and to finance\r\n  development projects. An unemployment rate of over 30% continues to be a\r\n  major problem.

Rapid growth of free\r\n  trade zones has established a significant expansion of manufacturing for\r\n  export, especially wearing apparel. Over the past decade, tourism has also\r\n  increased in importance and is a major earner of foreign exchange and a\r\n  source of new jobs. Agriculture remains a key sector of the economy. The\r\n  principal commercial crop is sugarcane, followed by coffee, cotton, cocoa,\r\n  and tobacco. Domestic industry is based on the processing of agricultural\r\n  products, oil refining, minerals, and chemicals.

Growth\r\n  has been uneven because of natural disasters, fluctuations in global oil\r\n  prices, and government policies designed to curb inflation. Banana exports,\r\n  second only to oil, have suffered as a result of EC import quotas and banana\r\n  blight. The new President Sixto DURAN-BALLEN, has a much more favorable\r\n  attitude toward foreign investment than did his predecessor. Ecuador has\r\n  implemented trade agreements with Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and Venezuela and\r\n  has applied for GATT membership. At the end of 1991, Ecuador received a\r\n  standby IMF loan of $105 million, which will permit the country to proceed\r\n  with the rescheduling of Paris Club debt. In September 1992, the government\r\n  launched a new, macroeconomic program that gives more play to market forces;\r\n  as of March 1993, the program seemed to be paying off.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $11.8 billion (1992)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  3% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,100 (1992)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):   70% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  8% (1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $1.9 billion;

Egypt's first IMF standby arrangement concluded\r\n  in mid-1987 was suspended in early 1988 because of the government's failure\r\n  to adopt promised reforms. Egypt signed a follow-on program with the IMF and\r\n  also negotiated a structural adjustment loan with the World Bank in 1991. In\r\n  1991-92 the government made solid progress on administrative reforms such as\r\n  liberalizing exchange and interest rates but resisted implementing major\r\n  structural reforms like streamlining the public sector. As a result, the\r\n  economy has not gained momentum and unemployment has become a growing\r\n  problem. In 1992-93 tourism has plunged 20% or so because of sporadic\r\n  attacks by Islamic extremists on tourist groups. President MUBARAK has cited\r\n  population growth as the main cause of the country's economic troubles. The\r\n  addition of about 1.4 million people a year to the already huge population\r\n  of 60 million exerts enormous pressure on the 5% of the land area available\r\n  for agriculture.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $41.2 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  2.1% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $730 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  21% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  20% (1992 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $12.6 billion;

Subsistence agriculture predominates, with\r\n  cocoa, coffee, and wood products providing income, foreign exchange, and\r\n  government revenues. There is little industry. Commerce accounts for about\r\n  8% of GDP and the construction, public works, and service sectors for about\r\n  38%. Undeveloped natural resources include titanium, iron ore, manganese,\r\n  uranium, and alluvial gold. Oil exploration, taking place under concessions\r\n  offered to US, French, and Spanish firms, has been moderately successful.\r\n  Increased production from recently discovered natural gas deposits will\r\n  provide a greater share of exports by 1995.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $144 million (1991 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -1% (1991 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $380 (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  1.4% (1990)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $26 million;

Most of the\r\n  population will continue to depend on subsistence farming. Domestic output\r\n  is substantially augmented by worker remittances from abroad. Government\r\n  revenues come from custom duties and income and sales taxes. Eritrea has\r\n  inherited the entire coastline of Ethiopia and has long-term prospects for\r\n  revenues from the devlopment of offshore oil, offshore fishing and tourist\r\n  development. For the time being, Ethiopia will be largely dependent on\r\n  Eritrean ports for its foreign trade.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $400 million (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $115 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  NA%\r\nUnemployment rate:   NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $NA;

Yet\r\n  serious problems remain. In contrast to the estimated 30% drop in output in\r\n  1992, GDP should grow by a small percent in 1993. Of key importance has been\r\n  the introduction of the kroon in August 1993 and the subsequent reductions\r\n  in inflation to 1%-2% per month. Starting in July 1991, under a new law on\r\n  private ownership, small enterprises, such as retail shops and restaurants,\r\n  were sold to private owners. The auctioning of large-scale enterprises is\r\n  progressing with the proceeds being held in escrow until the prior ownership\r\n  (that is, Estonian or the Commonwealth of Independent States) can be\r\n  established. Estonia ranks first in per capita consumption among the former\r\n  Soviet republics. Agriculture is well developed, especially meat production,\r\n  and provides a surplus for export. Only about one-fifth of the work force is\r\n  in agriculture. The major share of the work force engages in manufacturing\r\n  both capital and consumer goods based on raw materials and intermediate\r\n  products from the other former Soviet republics. These manufactures are of\r\n  high quality by ex-Soviet standards and are exported to the other republics.\r\n  Estonia's mineral resources are limited to major deposits of shale oil (60%\r\n  of the old Soviet total) and phosphorites (400 million tons). Estonia has a\r\n  large, relatively modern port and produces more than half of its own energy\r\n  needs at highly polluting shale oil power plants. It has advantages in the\r\n  transition, not having suffered so long under the Soviet yoke and having\r\n  better chances of developing profitable ties to the Nordic and West European\r\n  countries. Like Latvia, but unlike Lithuania, the large portion of ethnic\r\n  Russians (30%) in the population poses still another difficulty in the\r\n  transition to an independent market economy.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP $NA\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -30% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $NA\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  1%-2% per month (first quarter 1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  3% (March 1993);

(The accompanying analysis and figures predate the\r\n  independence of Eritrea.) Its economy is based on subsistence agriculture,\r\n  which accounts for about 45% of GDP, 90% of exports, and 80% of total\r\n  employment; coffee generates 60% of export earnings. The manufacturing\r\n  sector is heavily dependent on inputs from the agricultural sector. Over 90%\r\n  of large-scale industry, but less than 10% of agriculture, is state run; the\r\n  government is considering selling off a portion of state-owned plants.\r\n  Favorable agricultural weather largely explains the 4.5% growth in output in\r\n  FY89, whereas drought and deteriorating internal security conditions\r\n  prevented growth in FY90. In 1991 the lack of law and order, particularly in\r\n  the south, interfered with economic development and growth. In 1992, because\r\n  of some easing of civil strife and aid from the outside world, the economy\r\n  substantially improved.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $6.6 billion (FY92 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  6% (FY92 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $130 (FY92 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  7.8% (1989)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $1.4 billion;

A few dairy herds are kept to meet domestic\r\n  consumption of milk and milk products, and crops grown are primarily those\r\n  for providing winter fodder. Exports feature shipments of high-grade wool to\r\n  the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins. Rich stocks of fish in the\r\n  surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders. So far,\r\n  efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry have been unsuccessful. In\r\n  1987 the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers\r\n  operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone. These license fees\r\n  amount to more than $40 million per year and are a primary source of income\r\n  for the government. To encourage tourism, the Falkland Islands Development\r\n  Corporation has built three lodges for visitors attracted by the abundant\r\n  wildlife and trout fishing.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP $NA\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $NA\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  7.4% (1980-87 average)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%;

When the nations of the world extended\r\n  their fishing zones to 200 nautical miles in the early 1970s, the Faroese no\r\n  longer could continue their traditional long-distance fishing and\r\n  subsequently depleted their own nearby fishing areas. The government's tight\r\n  controls on fish stocks and its austerity measures have caused a recession,\r\n  and subsidy cuts will force nationalization in the fishing industry, which\r\n  has already been plagued with bankruptcies. Copenhagen has threatened to\r\n  withhold its annual subsidy of $130 million - roughly one-third of the\r\n  islands' budget revenues - unless the Faroese make significant efforts to\r\n  balance their budget. To this extent the Faroe government is expected to\r\n  continue its tough policies, including introducing a 20% VAT in 1993, and\r\n  has agreed to an IMF economic-political stabilization plan. In addition to\r\n  its annual subsidy, the Danish government has bailed out the second largest\r\n  Faroe bank to the tune of $140 million since October 1992.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $662 million (1989 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  3% (1989 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $14,000 (1989 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  2% (1988)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  5%-6% (1991 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $425 million;

Industry, including sugar\r\n  milling, contributes 13% to GDP. Fiji traditionally had earned considerable\r\n  sums of hard currency from the 250,000 tourists who visited each year. In\r\n  1987, however, after two military coups, the economy went into decline. GDP\r\n  dropped by 7.8% in 1987 and by another 2.5% in 1988; political uncertainty\r\n  created a drop in tourism, and the worst drought of the century caused sugar\r\n  production to fall sharply. In contrast, sugar and tourism turned in strong\r\n  performances in 1989, and the economy rebounded vigorously. In 1990 the\r\n  economy received a setback from cyclone Sina, which cut sugar output by an\r\n  estimated 21%. Sugar exports recovered in 1991-92.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $1.4 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  3% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,900 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  5% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  5.9% (1991 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $455 million;

Its key economic sector is\r\n  manufacturing - principally the wood, metals, and engineering industries.\r\n  Trade is important, with the export of goods representing about 30% of GDP.\r\n  Except for timber and several minerals, Finland depends on imports of raw\r\n  materials, energy, and some components for manufactured goods. Because of\r\n  the climate, agricultural development is limited to maintaining\r\n  self-sufficiency in basic products. The economy, which experienced an\r\n  average of 4.9% annual growth between 1987 and 1989, sank into deep\r\n  recession in 1991 as growth contracted by 6.5%. The recession - which\r\n  continued in 1992 with growth contracting by 3.5% - has been caused by\r\n  economic overheating, depressed foreign markets, and the dismantling of the\r\n  barter system between Finland and the former Soviet Union under which Soviet\r\n  oil and gas had been exchanged for Finnish manufactured goods. The Finnish\r\n  Government has proposed efforts to increase industrial competitiveness and\r\n  efficiency by an increase in exports to Western markets, cuts in public\r\n  expenditures, partial privatization of state enterprises, and changes in\r\n  monetary policy. In June 1991 Helsinki had tied the markka to the EC's\r\n  European Currency Unit (ECU) to promote stability. Ongoing speculation\r\n  resulting from a lack of confidence in the government's policies forced\r\n  Helsinki to devalue the markka by about 12% in November 1991 and to\r\n  indefinitely break the link in September 1992. By boosting the\r\n  competitiveness of Finnish exports, these measures presumably have kept the\r\n  economic downturn from being even more severe. Unemployment probably will\r\n  remain a serious problem during the next few years - monthly figures in\r\n  early 1993 are approaching 20% - with the majority of Finnish firms facing a\r\n  weak domestic market and the troubled German and Swedish export markets.\r\n  Declining revenues, increased transfer payments, and extensive funding to\r\n  bail out the banking system are expected to push the central government's\r\n  budget deficit to nearly 13% in 1993. Helsinki continues to harmonize its\r\n  economic policies with those of the EC during Finland's current EC\r\n  membership bid.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $79.4 billion (1992)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -3.5% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $15,900 (1992)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  2.1% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  13.1% (1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $26.8 billion;

the official flag for all French dependent areas\r\n\r\n*France, Economy\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\n  One of the world's most developed economies, France has substantial\r\n  agricultural resources and a highly diversified modern industrial sector.\r\n  Large tracts of fertile land, the application of modern technology, and\r\n  subsidies have combined to make it the leading agricultural producer in\r\n  Western Europe. France is largely self-sufficient in agricultural products\r\n  and is a major exporter of wheat and dairy products. The industrial sector\r\n  generates about one-quarter of GDP, and the growing services sector has\r\n  become crucial to the economy. The French economy is entering its fourth\r\n  consecutive year of sluggish growth after a strong expansion in the late\r\n  1980s. Growth averaged only 1.3% in 1990-92 and is expected to drop to\r\n  between zero and -0.5% in 1993. The government budget deficit rose to 3.2%\r\n  of GDP in 1992 and is expected to be far larger than planned in the 1993\r\n  budget. Paris remains committed to maintaining the franc-deutsch mark\r\n  parity, which has kept French interest rates high despite France's low\r\n  inflation. Although the pace of economic integration within the European\r\n  Community has slowed down, integration presumably will remain a major force\r\n  shaping the fortunes of the various economic sectors.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $1.08 trillion (1992)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1.1% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $18,900 (1992)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  2.1% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  10.5% (end 1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $220.5 billion;

In 1981-85, oil accounted for about 45% of GDP,\r\n  80% of export earnings, and 65% of government revenues on average. The high\r\n  oil prices of the early 1980s contributed to a substantial increase in per\r\n  capita national income, stimulated domestic demand, reinforced migration\r\n  from rural to urban areas, and raised the level of real wages to among the\r\n  highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. The subsequent slide of Gabon's economy,\r\n  which began with falling oil prices in 1985, was reversed in 1989-90, but\r\n  debt servicing obligations continue to limit prospects for further domestic\r\n  development. Real growth in 1991-92 was weak because of a combination of an\r\n  overstaffed bureaucracy, a large budget deficit, and the continued\r\n  underdevelopment of the whole economy outside the petroleum sector.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $4.6 billion (1991)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  13% (1990 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $4,200 (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  0.7% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $1.4 billion;

It is one of the world's poorest countries with a\r\n  per capita income of about $325. About 75% of the population is engaged in\r\n  crop production and livestock raising, which contribute 30% to GDP.\r\n  Small-scale manufacturing activity - processing peanuts, fish, and hides -\r\n  accounts for less than 10% of GDP. Tourism is a growing industry. The Gambia\r\n  imports one-third of its food, all fuel, and most manufactured goods.\r\n  Exports are concentrated on peanut products (about 75% of total value).\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $292 million (1991 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  3% (1991)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $325 (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  12% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $94 million; expenditures $80 million, including capital\r\n  expenditures of $25 million (FY91 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $133 million (f.o.b., FY91 est.)\r\n commodities:\r\n  peanuts and peanut products, fish, cotton lint, palm kernels\r\n partners:\r\n  Japan 60%, Europe 29%, Africa 5%, US 1%, other 5% (1989)\r\nImports:\r\n  $174 million (f.o.b., FY91 est.)\r\n commodities:\r\n  foodstuffs, manufactures, raw materials, fuel, machinery and transport\r\n  equipment\r\n partners:\r\n  Europe 57%, Asia 25%, USSR and Eastern Europe 9%, US 6%, other 3% (1989)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $336 million (December 1990 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 6.7%; accounts for 5.8% of GDP (FY90)\r\nElectricity:\r\n  30,000 kW capacity; 65 million kWh produced, 75 kWh per capita (1991)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  peanut processing, tourism, beverages, agricultural machinery assembly,\r\n  woodworking, metalworking, clothing\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  accounts for 30% of GDP and employs about 75% of the population; imports\r\n  one-third of food requirements; major export crop is peanuts; other\r\n  principal crops - millet, sorghum, rice, corn, cassava, palm kernels;\r\n  livestock - cattle, sheep, goats; forestry and fishing resources not fully\r\n  exploited\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-89), $93 million; Western (non-US)\r\n  countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments (1970-89), $535 million;\r\n  Communist countries (1970-89), $39 million\r\nCurrency:\r\n  1 dalasi (D) = 100 bututs\r\nExchange rates:\r\n  dalasi (D) per US$1 - 8.673 (October 1992), 8.803 (1991), 7.883 (1990),\r\n  7.5846 (1989), 6.7086 (1988), 7.0744 (1987)\r\n\r\n*The Gambia, Economy\r\n\r\nFiscal year:\r\n  1 July - 30 June\r\n\r\n*The Gambia, Communications\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\n  3,083 km total; 431 km paved, 501 km gravel/laterite, and 2,151 km\r\n  unimproved earth\r\nInland waterways:\r\n  400 km\r\nPorts:\r\n  Banjul\r\nAirports:\r\n total:\r\n  1\r\n usable:\r\n  1\r\n with permanent-surface runways:\r\n  1\r\n with runways over 3,659 m:\r\n  0\r\n with runways 2,440-3,659 m:\r\n  1\r\n with runways 1,220-2,439 m:\r\n  0\r\nTelecommunications:\r\n  adequate network of radio relay and wire; 3,500 telephones; broadcast\r\n  stations - 3 AM, 2 FM; 1 Atlantic Ocean INTELSAT earth station\r\n\r\n*The Gambia, Defense Forces\r\n\r\nBranches:\r\n  Army, Navy, National Gendarmerie, National Police\r\nManpower availability:\r\n  males age 15-49 201,026; fit for military service 101,642 (1993 est.)\r\nDefense expenditures:\r\n  exchange rate conversion - $NA, NA% of GDP\r\n\r\n*Gaza Strip, Header\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n  The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended with Israel in\r\n  control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Sinai, and the Golan\r\n  Heights. As stated in the 1978 Camp David accords and reaffirmed by\r\n  President Bush's post-Gulf crisis peace initiative, the final status of the\r\n  West Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors, and a\r\n  peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the\r\n  concerned parties. Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will\r\n  resolve the respective boundaries. Pending the completion of this process,\r\n  it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip\r\n  has yet to be determined. In the US view, the term West Bank describes all\r\n  of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian administration before\r\n  the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. With respect to negotiations envisaged in the\r\n  framework agreement, however, it is US policy that a distinction must be\r\n  made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the city's\r\n  special status and circumstances. Therefore, a negotiated solution for the\r\n  final status of Jerusalem could be different in character from that of the\r\n  rest of the West Bank.\r\n\r\n*Gaza Strip, Geography\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\n  Middle East, bordering the eastern Mediterranean Sea, between Egypt and\r\n  Israel\r\nMap references:\r\n  Middle East\r\nArea:\r\n total area:\r\n  380 km2\r\n land area:\r\n  380 km2\r\n comparative area:\r\n  slightly more than twice the size of Washington, DC\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total 62 km, Egypt 11 km, Israel 51 km\r\nCoastline:\r\n  40 km\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n  Israeli occupied with status to be determined\r\nInternational disputes:\r\n  Israeli occupied with status to be determined\r\nClimate:\r\n  temperate, mild winters, dry and warm to hot summers\r\nTerrain:\r\n  flat to rolling, sand- and dune-covered coastal plain\r\nNatural resources:\r\n  negligible\r\nLand use:\r\n arable land:\r\n  13%\r\n permanent crops:\r\n  32%\r\n meadows and pastures:\r\n  0%\r\n forest and woodland:\r\n  0%\r\n other:\r\n  55%\r\nIrrigated land:   200 km2\r\nEnvironment:\r\n  desertification\r\n\r\n*Gaza Strip, People\r\n\r\nPopulation:\r\n  705,834 (July 1993 est.)\r\n note:\r\n  in addition, there are 4,000 Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip (1993 est.)\r\nPopulation growth rate:\r\n  3.56% (1993 est.)\r\nBirth rate:\r\n  45.66 births/1,000 population (1993 est.)\r\nDeath rate:\r\n  5.71 deaths/1,000 population (1993 est.)\r\nNet migration rate:\r\n  -4.35 migrant(s)/1,000 population (1993 est.)\r\nInfant mortality rate:\r\n  38.9 deaths/1,000 live births (1993 est.)\r\nLife expectancy at birth:\r\n total population:\r\n  67.26 years\r\n male:\r\n  66.01 years\r\n female:\r\n  68.57 years (1993 est.)\r\nTotal fertility rate:\r\n  7.51 children born/woman (1993 est.)\r\nNationality:\r\n noun:\r\n  NA\r\n adjective:\r\n  NA\r\nEthnic divisions:\r\n  Palestinian Arab and other 99.8%, Jewish 0.2%\r\nReligions:\r\n  Muslim (predominantly Sunni) 99%, Christian 0.7%, Jewish 0.3%\r\nLanguages:\r\n  Arabic, Hebrew (spoken by Israeli settlers), English (widely understood)\r\nLiteracy:\r\n total population:\r\n  NA%\r\n male:\r\n  NA%\r\n female:\r\n  NA%\r\nLabor force:\r\n  NA\r\n by occupation:\r\n  small industry, commerce and business 32.0%, construction 24.4%, service and\r\n  other 25.5%, agriculture 18.1% (1984)\r\n note:\r\n  excluding Israeli Jewish settlers\r\n\r\n*Gaza Strip, Government\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n  The Gaza Strip is currently governed by Israeli military authorities and\r\n  Israeli civil administration.

The construction,\r\n  agricultural, and industrial sectors account for about 15%, 12%, and 8% of\r\n  GNP, respectively. Gaza depends upon Israel for some 90% of its external\r\n  trade. Unrest in the territory in 1988-93 (intifadah) has raised\r\n  unemployment and substantially lowered the standard of living of Gazans. The\r\n  Persian Gulf crisis and its aftershocks also have dealt severe blows to Gaza\r\n  since August 1990. Worker remittances from the Gulf states have plunged,\r\n  unemployment has increased, and exports have fallen dramatically.

Another salient characteristic of the economy has been a flourishing\r\n  private sector (compared with the other republics). About 25% of the labor\r\n  force is employed in agriculture. Mineral resources consist of manganese and\r\n  copper, and, to a lesser extent, molybdenum, arsenic, tungsten, and mercury.\r\n  Except for very small quantities of domestic oil, gas, and coal, fuel must\r\n  be imported from neighboring republics. Oil and its products have been\r\n  delivered by pipeline from Azerbaijan to the port of Batumi for export and\r\n  local refining. Gas has been supplied in pipelines from Krasnodar and\r\n  Stavropol'. The dismantling of central economic controls has been delayed by\r\n  political factionalism, marked by bitter armed struggles. In early 1993 the\r\n  Georgian economy was operating at well less than half capacity due to\r\n  disruptions in fuel supplies and vital transportation links as a result of\r\n  conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, antigovernment activity in Western\r\n  Georgia, and Azerbaijani pressure against Georgian assistance for Armenia.\r\n  To restore economic viability, Georgia must establish domestic peace and\r\n  must maintain economic ties to the other former Soviet republics while\r\n  developing new links to the West.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP $NA\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -35% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $NA\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  50% per month (January 1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  3% but large numbers of underemployed workers\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $NA;

The Federal Republic, however, continues to\r\n  experience difficulties in integrating and modernizing eastern Germany, and\r\n  the tremendous costs of unification have sunk western Germany deeper into\r\n  recession. The western German economy grew by less than 1% in 1992 as the\r\n  Bundesbank set high interest rates to offset the inflationary effects of\r\n  large government deficits and high wage settlements. Eastern Germany grew by\r\n  6.8% in 1992 but this was from a shrunken base. Despite government transfers\r\n  to the east amounting to nearly $110 billion annually, a self-sustaining\r\n  economy in the region is still some years away. The bright spots are eastern\r\n  Germany's construction, transportation, telecommunications, and service\r\n  sectors, which have experienced strong growth. Western Germany has an\r\n  advanced market economy and is a world leader in exports. It has a highly\r\n  urbanized and skilled population that enjoys excellent living standards,\r\n  abundant leisure time, and comprehensive social welfare benefits. Western\r\n  Germany is relatively poor in natural resources, coal being the most\r\n  important mineral. Western Germany's world-class companies manufacture\r\n  technologically advanced goods. The region's economy is mature: services and\r\n  manufacturing account for the dominant share of economic activity, and raw\r\n  materials and semimanufactured goods constitute a large portion of imports.\r\n  In recent years, manufacturing has accounted for about 31% of GDP, with\r\n  other sectors contributing lesser amounts. Gross fixed investment in 1992\r\n  accounted for about 21.5% of GDP. GDP in the western region is now $20,000\r\n  per capita, or 85% of US per capita GDP. Eastern Germany's economy appears\r\n  to be changing from one anchored on manufacturing into a more\r\n  service-oriented economy. The German government, however, is intent on\r\n  maintaining a manufacturing base in the east and is considering a policy for\r\n  subsidizing industrial cores in the region. Eastern Germany's share of\r\n  all-German GDP is only 7% and eastern productivity is just 30% that of the\r\n  west even though eastern wages are at roughly 70% of western levels. The\r\n  privatization agency for eastern Germany, Treuhand, has privatized more than\r\n  four-fifths of the almost 12,000 firms under its control and will likely\r\n  wind down operations in 1994. Private investment in the region continues to\r\n  be lackluster, resulting primarily from the deepening recession in western\r\n  Germany and excessively high eastern wages. Eastern Germany has one of the\r\n  world's largest reserves of low-grade lignite coal but little else in the\r\n  way of mineral resources. The quality of statistics from eastern Germany is\r\n  improving, yet many gaps remain; the federal government began producing\r\n  all-German data for select economic statistics at the start of 1992. The\r\n  most challenging economic problem is promoting eastern Germany's economic\r\n  reconstruction - specifically, finding the right mix of fiscal, monetary,\r\n  regulatory, and tax policies that will spur investment in eastern Germany -\r\n  without destabilizing western Germany's economy or damaging relations with\r\n  West European partners. The government hopes a \"solidarity pact\" among labor\r\n  unions, business, state governments, and the SPD opposition will provide the\r\n  right mix of wage restraints, investment incentives, and spending cuts to\r\n  stimulate eastern recovery. Finally, the homogeneity of the German economic\r\n  culture has been changed by the admission of large numbers of immigrants.\r\nNational product:\r\n Germany:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $1.398 trillion (1992)\r\n western:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $1.294 trillion (1992)\r\n eastern:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $104 billion (1992)\r\n\r\n*Germany, Economy\r\n\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n Germany:\r\n  1.5% (1992)\r\n western:\r\n  0.9% (1992)\r\n eastern:\r\n  8% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n Germany:\r\n  $17,400 (1992)\r\n western:\r\n  $20,000 (1992)\r\n eastern:\r\n  $6,500 (1992)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n western:\r\n  4% (1992)\r\n eastern:\r\n  NA%\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n western:\r\n  7.1% (1992)\r\n eastern:\r\n  13.5% (December 1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n western (federal, state, local):\r\n  revenues $684 billion;

Heavily\r\n  dependent on cocoa, gold, and timber exports, economic growth so far has not\r\n  spread substantially to other areas of the economy. The costs of sending\r\n  peacekeeping forces to Liberia and preparing for the transition to a\r\n  democratic government have boosted government expenditures and undercut\r\n  structural adjustment reforms. Ghana opened a stock exchange in 1990.\r\n  Meanwhile, declining world commodity prices for Ghana's exports has placed\r\n  the government under severe financial pressure.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $6.6 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  3.9% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $410 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  10% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  10% (1991)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $1.0 billion;

Tourism continues as a major source of foreign exchange, and\r\n  agriculture is self-sufficient except for meat, dairy products, and animal\r\n  feedstuffs. Since 1986, real GDP growth has averaged only 1.6% a year,\r\n  compared with the Europen Community average of 3%. The MITSOTAKIS government\r\n  has made little progress during its two and one-half years in power in\r\n  coming to grips with Greece's main economic problems: an inflation rate\r\n  still four times the EC average, a large public sector deficit, and a\r\n  fragile current account position. In early 1991, the government secured a\r\n  three-year, $2.5 billion assistance package from the EC under the strictest\r\n  terms yet imposed on a member country, as the EC finally ran out of patience\r\n  with Greece's failure to put its financial affairs in order. On the advice\r\n  of the EC Commission, Greece delayed applying for the second installment\r\n  until 1993 because of the failure of the government to meet the 1992\r\n  targets. Although MITSOTAKIS faced down the unions in mid-1992 in a dispute\r\n  over privatization plans, social security reform, and tax and price\r\n  increases, and his new economics czar, Stephanos MANOS, is a respected\r\n  economist committed to renovating the ailing economy. However, a national\r\n  elections due by May 1994 will probably prompt MITSOTAKIS to backtrack on\r\n  economic reform. In 1993, the GDP growth rate likely will remain low; the\r\n  inflation rate probably will continue to fall, while remaining the highest\r\n  in the EC.\r\nNational product:   GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $82.9 billion (1992)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1.2% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $8,200 (1992)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  15.6% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  9.1% (1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $37.6 billion;

Prospects for economic growth in the immediate future are not\r\n  bright. The Home Rule Government's economic restraint measures introduced in\r\n  the late 1980s have assisted in shifting red figures into a balance in the\r\n  public budget. Foreign trade produced a surplus in 1989 and 1990, but has\r\n  now returned to a deficit. Following the closing of the Black Angel lead and\r\n  zinc mine in 1989, Greenland today is fully dependent on fishing and fish\r\n  processing, this sector accounting for 95% of exports. Prospects for\r\n  fisheries are not bright, as the important shrimp catches will at best\r\n  stabilize and cod catches have dropped. Resumption of mining and hydrocarbon\r\n  activities is not around the corner, thus leaving only tourism with some\r\n  potential for the near future. The public sector in Greenland, i.e. the HRG\r\n  and its commercial entities and the municipalities, plays a dominant role in\r\n  Greenland accounting for about two thirds of total employment. About half\r\n  the government's revenues come from grants from the Danish Government.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GNP - purchasing power equivalent - $500 million (1988)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -10% (1990)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $9,000 (1988)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):   1.6% (1991)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  9% (1990 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $381 million;

Tourism is\r\n  a key industry, with most tourists from the US. In addition, an increasingly\r\n  large number of cruise ships visit the islands. The traditionally important\r\n  sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by other crops, such as bananas\r\n  (which now supply about 50% of export earnings), eggplant, and flowers.\r\n  Other vegetables and root crops are cultivated for local consumption,\r\n  although Guadeloupe is still dependent on imported food, which comes mainly\r\n  from France.

After growing on average at less\r\n  than 1% a year in 1986-87, GDP dropped by 5% a year in 1988-90. The decline\r\n  resulted from bad weather, labor trouble in the cane fields, and flooding\r\n  and equipment problems in the bauxite industry. Consumer prices rose about\r\n  100% in 1989 and 75% in 1990, and the current account deficit widened\r\n  substantially as sugar and bauxite exports fell. Moreover, electric power\r\n  has been in short supply and constitutes a major barrier to future gains in\r\n  national output. The government, in association with international financial\r\n  agencies, seeks to reduce its payment arrears and to raise new funds. The\r\n  government's stabilization program - aimed at establishing realistic\r\n  exchange rates, reasonable price stability, and a resumption of growth -\r\n  requires considerable public administrative abilities and continued patience\r\n  by consumers during a long incubation period. Buoyed by a recovery in mining\r\n  and agriculture, the economy posted 6% growth in 1991 and 7% growth in 1992,\r\n  according to official figures. A large volume of illegal and quasi-legal\r\n  economic activity is not captured in estimates of the country's total\r\n  output.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $267.5 million (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  7% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $370 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  15% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  12%-15% (1991 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $121 million;

Basic\r\n  problems facing the economy include rapid population growth, high\r\n  unemployment, a lack of basic services, a large and inefficient public\r\n  sector, and the dependence of the export sector mostly on coffee and\r\n  bananas, which are subject to sharp price fluctuations.

Natural resources are limited, and food and raw materials must be\r\n  imported. Manufacturing accounts for about 18% of GDP, employs 28% of the\r\n  labor force, and exports about 90% of its output. Real GDP growth averaged a\r\n  remarkable 8% in 1987-88, slowed to 3.0% in 1989-90, and picked up to 4.2%\r\n  in 1991 and 5.9% in 1992. Unemployment, which has been declining since the\r\n  mid-1980s, is now about 2%. A shortage of labor continues to put upward\r\n  pressure on prices and the cost of living. Short-term prospects remain\r\n  bright so long as major trading partners continue to be reasonably\r\n  prosperous.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $86 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  5.9% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $14,600 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  9.4% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  2% (1992 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $17.4 billion;

Agriculture is an important sector, providing sizable export\r\n  earnings and meeting domestic food needs. Industry accounts for about 40% of\r\n  GDP and 30% of employment. Hungary claims that less than 25% of foreign\r\n  trade is now with former CEMA countries, while about 70% is with OECD\r\n  members. Hungary's economic reform programs during the Communist era gave it\r\n  a head start in creating a market economy and attracting foreign investment.\r\n  In 1991, Hungary received 60% of all foreign investment in Eastern Europe,\r\n  and in 1992 received the largest single share. The growing private sector\r\n  accounts for about one-third of national output according to unofficial\r\n  estimates. Privatization of state enterprises is progressing, although\r\n  excessive red tape, bureaucratic oversight, and uncertainties about pricing\r\n  have slowed the process. Escalating unemployment and high rates of inflation\r\n  may impede efforts to speed up privatization and budget reform, while\r\n  Hungary's heavy foreign debt will make the government reluctant to introduce\r\n  full convertibility of the forint before 1994 and to rein in inflation. The\r\n  government is projecting an end to the 5-year recession in 1993, and GDP is\r\n  forecast to grow 0%-3%.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $55.4 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -5% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $5,380 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  23% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  12.3% (1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $13.2 billion;

The economy is heavily dependent on the fishing\r\n  industry, which provides nearly 75% of export earnings and employs 12% of\r\n  the workforce. In the absence of other natural resources - except energy -\r\n  Iceland's economy is vulnerable to changing world fish prices. Iceland's\r\n  economy has been in recession since 1988. The recession deepened in 1992 due\r\n  to severe cutbacks in fishing quotas and falling world prices for the\r\n  country's main exports: fish and fish products, aluminum, and ferrosilicon.\r\n  Real GDP declined 3.3% in 1992 and is forecast to contract another 1.5% in\r\n  1993. The center-right government's economic goals include reducing the\r\n  budget and current account deficits, limiting foreign borrowing, containing\r\n  inflation, revising agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying the\r\n  economy, and privatizing state-owned industries. The recession has led to a\r\n  wave of bankruptcies and mergers throughout the economy, as well as the\r\n  highest unemployment of the post-World War II period. The national\r\n  unemployment rate reached 5% in early 1993, with some parts of the country\r\n  experiencing unemployment in the 9-10% range. Inflation, previously a\r\n  serious problem, declined from double digit rates in the 1980s to only 3.7%\r\n  in 1992.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $4.5 billion (1992)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -3.3% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $17,400 (1992)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  3.7% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  5% (first quarter 1993)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $1.8 billion;

Faster economic growth in the 1980s permitted a\r\n  significant increase in real per capita private consumption. A large share\r\n  of the population, perhaps as much as 40%, remains too poor to afford an\r\n  adequate diet. Financial strains in 1990 and 1991 prompted government\r\n  austerity measures that slowed industrial growth but permitted India to meet\r\n  its international payment obligations without rescheduling its debt. Policy\r\n  reforms since 1991 have extended earlier economic liberalization and greatly\r\n  reduced government controls on production, trade, and investment.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $240 billion (FY93 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  4% (FY93 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $270 (FY93 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  11.9% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $39.2 billion;

It carries a\r\n  particularly heavy traffic of petroleum and petroleum products from the oil\r\n  fields of the Persian Gulf and Indonesia. Its fish are of great and growing\r\n  importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export.\r\n  Fishing fleets from Russia, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian\r\n  Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being\r\n  tapped in the offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and Western\r\n  Australia. An estimated 40% of the world's offshore oil production comes\r\n  from the Indian Ocean.

Real GDP growth in 1985-92\r\n  averaged about 6%, quite impressive, but not sufficient to both slash\r\n  underemployment and absorb the 2.3 million workers annually entering the\r\n  labor force. Agriculture, including forestry and fishing, is an important\r\n  sector, accounting for almost 20% of GDP and over 50% of the labor force.\r\n  The staple crop is rice. Once the world's largest rice importer, Indonesia\r\n  is now nearly self-sufficient. Plantation crops - rubber and palm oil - and\r\n  textiles and plywood are being encouraged for both export and job\r\n  generation. Industrial output now accounts for almost 40% of GDP and is\r\n  based on a supply of diverse natural resources, including crude oil, natural\r\n  gas, timber, metals, and coal. Of these, the oil sector dominates the\r\n  external economy, generating more than 20% of the government's revenues and\r\n  40% of export earnings in 1989. However, the economy's growth is highly\r\n  dependent on the continuing expansion of nonoil exports. Japan remains\r\n  Indonesia's most important customer and supplier of aid. Rapid growth in the\r\n  money supply in 1989-90 prompted Jakarta to implement a tight monetary\r\n  policy in 1991, forcing the private sector to go to foreign banks for\r\n  investment financing. Real interest rates remained above 10% and off-shore\r\n  commercial debt grew. The growth in off-shore debt prompted Jakarta to limit\r\n  foreign borrowing beginning in late 1991. Despite the continued problems in\r\n  moving toward a more open financial system and the persistence of a fairly\r\n  tight credit situation, GDP growth in 1992 is estimated to have stayed at\r\n  6%.\r\nNational product:   GDP - exchange rate conversion - $133 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  6% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $680 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  8% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  3% ;

After a decade of economic decline, Iran's\r\n  real GDP grew by 10% in FY90 and 6% in FY91, according to Iranian Government\r\n  statistics. An oil windfall in 1990 combined with a substantial increase in\r\n  imports contributed to Iran's recent economic growth. Iran has also begun\r\n  implementing a number of economic reforms to reduce government intervention\r\n  (including subsidies) and has allocated substantial resources to development\r\n  projects in the hope of stimulating the economy. Lower oil revenues in 1991\r\n  - oil accounts for more than 90% of export revenues - together with a surge\r\n  in imports greatly weakened Iran's international financial position. By\r\n  mid-1992 Iran was unable to meet its obligations to foreign creditors.\r\n  Subsequently the government has tried to boost oil exports, curb imports\r\n  (especially of consumer goods), and renegotiate terms of its foreign debts.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GNP - exchange rate conversion - $90 billion (FY92)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  6% (FY91)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,500 (FY91)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  23.7% (September 1991-September 1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  30% (1991 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $63 billion;

The\r\n  economy has been dominated by the oil sector, which has traditionally\r\n  provided about 95% of foreign exchange earnings. In the 1980s, financial\r\n  problems caused by massive expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and\r\n  damage to oil export facilities by Iran, led the government to implement\r\n  austerity measures and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt\r\n  payments. After the end of hostilities in 1988, oil exports gradually\r\n  increased with the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged\r\n  facilities. Agricultural development remained hampered by labor shortages,\r\n  salinization, and dislocations caused by previous land reform and\r\n  collectivization programs. The industrial sector, although accorded high\r\n  priority by the government, also was under financial constraints. Iraq's\r\n  seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, subsequent international economic\r\n  embargoes, and military action by an international coalition beginning in\r\n  January 1991 drastically changed the economic picture. Industrial and\r\n  transportation facilities suffered severe damage and have been only\r\n  partially restored. Oil exports remain at less than 10% of the previous\r\n  level. Shortages of spare parts continue. Living standards deteriorated even\r\n  further in 1992 and early 1993; consumer prices at least tripled in 1992.\r\n  The UN-sponsored economic embargo has reduced exports and imports and has\r\n  contributed to the sharp rise in prices. The government's policies of\r\n  supporting large military and internal security forces and of allocating\r\n  resources to key supporters of the regime have exacerbated shortages. In\r\n  brief, per capita output in early 1993 is far below the 1989-90 level, but\r\n  no reliable estimate is available.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GNP - exchange rate conversion - $35 billion (1989 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  10% (1989 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,940 (1989 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  200% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  less than 5% (1989 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $NA;

Agriculture, once the most\r\n  important sector, is now dwarfed by industry, which accounts for 37% of GDP,\r\n  about 80% of exports, and employs 28% of the labor force. Since 1987, real\r\n  GDP growth, led by exports, has averaged 4% annually. Over the same period,\r\n  inflation has fallen sharply and chronic trade deficits have been\r\n  transformed into annual surpluses. Unemployment, at 22.7% remains a serious\r\n  problem, however, and job creation is the main focus of government policy.\r\n  To ease unemployment, Dublin aggressively courts foreign investors and\r\n  recently created a new industrial development agency to aid small indigenous\r\n  firms. Government assistance is constrained by Dublin's continuing deficit\r\n  reduction measures. After five years of fiscal restraint, total government\r\n  debt still exceeds GDP. Growth probably will moderate in 1993 as the heavily\r\n  indebted and trade-dependent economy is highly sensitive to changes in\r\n  exchange rates and world interest rates. Exports to the UK, Ireland's major\r\n  export market, probably will be hurt by the recent appreciation of the Irish\r\n  currency against sterling - for the first time since 1979 the value of the\r\n  Irish pound exceeds that of its British counterpart.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $42.4 billion (1992)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  2% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $12,000 (1992)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  3.5% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:   22.7% (1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $16.0 billion; expenditures $16.6 billion, including capital\r\n  expenditures of $1.6 billion (1992 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $28.3 billion (f.o.b., 1992)\r\n commodities:\r\n  chemicals, data processing equipment, industrial machinery, live animals,\r\n  animal products\r\n partners:\r\n  EC 75% (UK 32%, Germany 13%, France 10%), US 9%\r\nImports:\r\n  $23.3 billion (c.i.f., 1992)\r\n commodities:\r\n  food, animal feed, data processing equipment, petroleum and petroleum\r\n  products, machinery, textiles, clothing\r\n partners:\r\n  EC 66% (UK 41%, Germany 8%, Netherlands 4%), US 15%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $15 billion (1990)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 8.0% (1992 est.); accounts for 37% of GDP\r\nElectricity:\r\n  5,000,000 kW capacity; 14,500 million kWh produced, 4,120 kWh per capita\r\n  (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  food products, brewing, textiles, clothing, chemicals, pharmaceuticals,\r\n  machinery, transportation equipment, glass and crystal\r\n\r\n*Ireland, Economy\r\n\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  accounts for 11% of GDP and 13% of the labor force; principal crops -\r\n  turnips, barley, potatoes, sugar beets, wheat; livestock - meat and dairy\r\n  products; 85% self-sufficient in food; food shortages include bread grain,\r\n  fruits, vegetables\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  donor - ODA commitments (1980-89), $90 million\r\nCurrency:\r\n  1 Irish pound (#Ir) = 100 pence\r\nExchange rates:\r\n  Irish pounds (#Ir) per US$1 - 0.6118 (January 1993), 0.5864 (1992), 0.6190\r\n  (1991), 0.6030 (1990), 0.7472 (1989), 0.6553 (1988)\r\nFiscal year:\r\n  calendar year\r\n\r\n*Ireland, Communications\r\n\r\nRailroads:\r\n  Irish National Railways (CIE) operates 1,947 km 1.602-meter gauge,\r\n  government owned; 485 km double track; 37 km electrified\r\nHighways:   92,294 km total; 87,422 km paved, 4,872 km gravel or crushed stone\r\nInland waterways:\r\n  limited for commercial traffic\r\nPipelines:\r\n  natural gas 225 km\r\nPorts:\r\n  Cork, Dublin, Waterford\r\nMerchant marine:\r\n  57 ships (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 154,647 GRT/186,432 DWT; includes 4\r\n  short-sea passenger, 33 cargo, 2 refrigerated cargo, 4 container, 3 oil\r\n  tanker, 3 specialized tanker, 3 chemical tanker, 5 bulk\r\nAirports:\r\n total:\r\n  40\r\n usable:\r\n  39\r\n with permanent-surface runways:\r\n  13\r\n with runways over 3,659 m:\r\n  0\r\n with runways 2,440-3,659 m:\r\n  2\r\n with runways 1,220-2,439 m:\r\n  6\r\nTelecommunications:\r\n  modern system using cable and digital microwave circuits; 900,000\r\n  telephones; broadcast stations - 9 AM, 45 FM, 86 TV; 2 coaxial submarine\r\n  cables; 1 Atlantic Ocean INTELSAT earth station\r\n\r\n*Ireland, Defense Forces\r\n\r\nBranches:\r\n  Army (including Naval Service and Air Corps), National Police (Garda\r\n  Siochana)\r\nManpower availability:\r\n  males age 15-49 903,536; fit for military service 731,085; reach military\r\n  age (17) annually 33,932 (1993 est.)\r\nDefense expenditures:\r\n  exchange rate conversion - $569 million, 1-2% of GDP (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n*Israel, Header\r\n\r\nAffiliation:\r\n  (also see separate Gaza Strip and West Bank entries)\r\nNote:\r\n  The Arab territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 war are not included\r\n  in the data below.

It\r\n  depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military\r\n  equipment. Despite limited natural resources, Israel has intensively\r\n  developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years.\r\n  Industry employs about 20% of Israeli workers, agriculture 5%, and services\r\n  most of the rest. Diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural\r\n  products (fruits and vegetables) are leading exports. Israel usually posts\r\n  balance-of-payments deficits, which are covered by large transfer payments\r\n  from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half of the government's $17\r\n  billion external debt is owed to the United States, which is its major\r\n  source of economic and military aid. To earn needed foreign exchange, Israel\r\n  has been targeting high-technology niches in international markets, such as\r\n  medical scanning equipment. The influx of Jewish immigrants from the former\r\n  USSR, which topped 400,000 during the period 1990-92, has increased\r\n  unemployment, intensified housing problems, and widened the government\r\n  budget deficit.

The country is still divided into a\r\n  developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and an\r\n  undeveloped agricultural south, dominated by large public enterprises.\r\n  Services account for 48% of GDP, industry 35%, agriculture 4%, and public\r\n  administration 13%. Most raw materials needed by industry and over 75% of\r\n  energy requirements must be imported. After growing at an annual average\r\n  rate of 3% in 1983-90, growth slowed to about 1% in 1991 and 1992. In the\r\n  second half of 1992, Rome became unsettled by the prospect of not qualifying\r\n  to participate in EC plans for economic and monetary union later in the\r\n  decade; thus it finally began to address its huge fiscal imbalances. Thanks\r\n  to the determination of Prime Minister AMATO, the government adopted a\r\n  fairly stringent budget for 1993, abandoned its highly inflationary wage\r\n  indexation system, and started to scale back its extremely generous social\r\n  welfare programs, including pension and health care benefits. Monetary\r\n  officials, who were forced to withdraw the lira from the European monetary\r\n  system in September 1992 when it came under extreme pressure in currency\r\n  markets, remain committed to bringing the currency back into the grid as\r\n  soon as conditions warrant. For the 1990s, Italy faces the problems of\r\n  refurbishing a tottering communications system, curbing pollution in major\r\n  industrial centers, and adjusting to the new competitive forces accompanying\r\n  the ongoing economic integration of the European Community.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $1.012 trillion (1992)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  0.9% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $17,500 (1992)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  5.4% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  11% (1992 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $447 billion;

In 1985 it suffered a\r\n  setback with the closure of some facilities in the bauxite and alumina\r\n  industry, a major source of hard currency earnings. Since 1986 an economic\r\n  recovery has been under way. In 1987 conditions began to improve for the\r\n  bauxite and alumina industry because of increases in world metal prices. The\r\n  recovery has also been supported by growth in the manufacturing and tourism\r\n  sectors. In September 1988, Hurricane Gilbert inflicted severe damage on\r\n  crops and the electric power system, a sharp but temporary setback to the\r\n  economy. By October 1989 the economic recovery from the hurricane was\r\n  largely complete, and real growth was up about 3% for 1989. In 1991,\r\n  however, growth dropped to 0.2% as a result of the US recession, lower world\r\n  bauxite prices, and monetary instability. In 1992, growth was 1.5%,\r\n  supported by a recovery in tourism and stabilization of the Jamaican dollar\r\n  in the second half of 1992.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $3.7 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1.5% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,500 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  52% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  15.4% (1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $600 million;

Industry, the most important\r\n  sector of the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and\r\n  fuels. Self-sufficient in rice, Japan must import about 50% of its\r\n  requirements of other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one of the\r\n  world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global\r\n  catch. Overall economic growth has been spectacular: a 10% average in the\r\n  1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s and 1980s. Economic growth slowed markedly\r\n  in 1992 largely because of contractionary domestic policies intended to\r\n  wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. At the\r\n  same time, the stronger yen and slower global growth are containing export\r\n  growth. Unemployment and inflation remain low at 2%. Japan continues to run\r\n  a huge trade surplus - $107 billion in 1992, up nearly 40% from the year\r\n  earlier - which supports extensive investment in foreign assets. The\r\n  crowding of its habitable land area and the aging of its population are two\r\n  major long-run problems.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $2.468 trillion (1992)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1.5% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $19,800 (1992)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  2.1% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  2.2% (1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $490 billion;

Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and especially flowers are\r\n  important export crops, shipped mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy\r\n  cattle is known worldwide and represents an important export earner. Milk\r\n  products go to the UK and other EC countries. In 1986 the finance sector\r\n  overtook tourism as the main contributor to GDP, accounting for 40% of the\r\n  island's output. In recent years the government has encouraged light\r\n  industry to locate in Jersey, with the result that an electronics industry\r\n  has developed alongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear. All raw\r\n  material and energy requirements are imported, as well as a large share of\r\n  Jersey's food needs.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP $NA\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  8% (1987 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $NA\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  8% (1988 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $308.0 million; expenditures $284.4 million, including capital\r\n  expenditures of $NA (1985)\r\nExports:\r\n  $NA\r\n commodities:\r\n  light industrial and electrical goods, foodstuffs, textiles\r\n partners:\r\n  UK\r\nImports:\r\n  $NA\r\n commodities:\r\n  machinery and transport equipment, manufactured goods, foodstuffs, mineral\r\n  fuels, chemicals\r\n partners:\r\n  UK\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $NA\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate NA%\r\nElectricity:\r\n  50,000 kW standby capacity (1992); power supplied by France\r\nIndustries:\r\n  tourism, banking and finance, dairy\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  potatoes, cauliflowers, tomatoes; dairy and cattle farming\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  none\r\nCurrency:\r\n  1 Jersey pound (#J) = 100 pence\r\nExchange rates:\r\n  Jersey pounds (#J) per US$1 - 0.6527 (January 1993), 0.5664 (1992), 0.5652\r\n  (1991), 0.5603 (1990), 0.6099 (1989), 0.5614 (1988); the Jersey pound is at\r\n  par with the British pound\r\nFiscal year:\r\n  1 April - 31 March\r\n\r\n*Jersey, Communications\r\n\r\nPorts:\r\n  Saint Helier, Gorey, Saint Aubin\r\nAirports:\r\n total:\r\n  1\r\n useable:\r\n  1\r\n with permanent-surface runways:\r\n  1\r\n with runways over 3,659 m:\r\n  0\r\n with runways 2,440-3,659 m:\r\n  0\r\n with runways 1,220-2,439 m:\r\n  1\r\nTelecommunications:\r\n  63,700 telephones; broadcast stations - 1 AM, no FM, 1 TV; 3 submarine\r\n  cables\r\n\r\n*Jersey, Defense Forces\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n  defense is the responsibility of the UK\r\n\r\n*Johnston Atoll, Header\r\n\r\nAffiliation:\r\n  (territory of the US)\r\n\r\n*Johnston Atoll, Geography\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\n  in the North Pacific Ocean, 1,430 km west-southwest of Honolulu, about\r\n  one-third of the way between Hawaii and the Marshall Islands\r\nMap references:\r\n  Oceania\r\nArea:\r\n total area:\r\n  2.8 km2\r\n land area:\r\n  2.8 km2\r\n comparative area:   about 4.7 times the size of the Mall in Washington, DC\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  0 km\r\nCoastline:\r\n  10 km\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n contiguous zone:\r\n  24 nm\r\n continental shelf:\r\n  200 m or depth of exploitation\r\n exclusive economic zone:\r\n  200 nm\r\n territorial sea:\r\n  12 nm\r\nInternational disputes:\r\n  none\r\nClimate:\r\n  tropical, but generally dry; consistent northeast trade winds with little\r\n  seasonal temperature variation\r\nTerrain:\r\n  mostly flat with a maximum elevation of 4 meters\r\nNatural resources:\r\n  guano (deposits worked until about 1890)\r\nLand use:\r\n arable land:\r\n  0%\r\n permanent crops:\r\n  0%\r\n meadows and pastures:\r\n  0%\r\n forest and woodland:\r\n  0%\r\n other:\r\n  100%\r\nIrrigated land:\r\n  0 km2\r\nEnvironment:\r\n  some low-growing vegetation\r\nNote:\r\n  strategic location in the North Pacific Ocean; Johnston Island and Sand\r\n  Island are natural islands; North Island (Akau) and East Island (Hikina) are\r\n  manmade islands formed from coral dredging; closed to the public; former\r\n  nuclear weapons test site; site of Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal\r\n  System (JACADS)\r\n\r\n*Johnston Atoll, People\r\n\r\nPopulation:\r\n  no indigenous inhabitants; note - there are 1,400 US Government personnel\r\n  and contractors\r\n\r\n*Johnston Atoll, Government\r\n\r\nNames:\r\n conventional long form:\r\n  none\r\n conventional short form:\r\n  Johnston Atoll\r\nDigraph:\r\n  JQ\r\nType:\r\n  unincorportated territory of the US administered by the US Defense Nuclear\r\n  Agency (DNA) and managed cooperatively by DNA and the Fish and Wildlife\r\n  Service of the US Department of the Interior as part of the National\r\n  Wildlife Refuge system\r\nCapital:\r\n  none; administered from Washington, DC\r\nDiplomatic representation in US:\r\n  none (territory of the US)\r\nFlag:\r\n  the flag of the US is used\r\n\r\n*Johnston Atoll, Economy\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\n  Economic activity is limited to providing services to US military personnel\r\n  and contractors located on the island.

In\r\n  the remainder of the 1980s, however, reductions in both Arab aid and worker\r\n  remittances slowed economic growth to an average of roughly 2% per year.\r\n  Imports - mainly oil, capital goods, consumer durables, and food - have been\r\n  outstripping exports, with the difference covered by aid, remittances, and\r\n  borrowing. In mid-1989, the Jordanian Government began debt-rescheduling\r\n  negotiations and agreed to implement an IMF program designed to gradually\r\n  reduce the budget deficit and implement badly needed structural reforms. The\r\n  Persian Gulf crisis that began in August 1990, however, aggravated Jordan's\r\n  already serious economic problems, forcing the government to shelve the IMF\r\n  program, stop most debt payments, and suspend rescheduling negotiations.

Kazakhstan is highly dependent\r\n  on trade with Russia, exchanging its natural resources for finished consumer\r\n  and industrial goods. Kazakhstan now finds itself with serious pollution\r\n  problems, backward technology, and little experience in foreign markets. The\r\n  government in 1992 continued to push privatization of the economy and freed\r\n  many prices. Output in 1992 dropped because of problems common to the\r\n  ex-Soviet Central Asian republics, especially the cumulative effects of the\r\n  disruption of old supply channels and the slow process of creating new\r\n  economic institutions. Kazakhstan lacks the funds, technology, and\r\n  managerial skills for a quick recovery of output. US firms have been\r\n  enlisted to increase oil output but face formidable obstacles; for example,\r\n  oil can now reach Western markets only through pipelines that run across\r\n  independent former Soviet republics. Finally, the end of monolithic\r\n  Communist control has brought ethnic grievances into the open. The 6 million\r\n  Russians in the republic, formerly the favored class, now face the hostility\r\n  of a society dominated by Muslims. Ethnic rivalry will be just one of the\r\n  formidable obstacles to the prioritization of national objectives and the\r\n  creation of a productive, technologically advancing society.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP $NA\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -15% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $NA\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  28% per month (first quarter 1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  0.4% includes only officially registered unemployed;

In the meantime, GDP\r\n  growth in the near term has kept slightly ahead of population - annually\r\n  averaging 4.9% in the 1986-90 period. Undependable weather conditions and a\r\n  shortage of arable land hamper long-term growth in agriculture, the leading\r\n  economic sector. In 1991, deficient rainfall, stagnant export volume, and\r\n  sagging export prices held economic growth below the all-important\r\n  population growth figure, and in 1992 output fell.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $8.3 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -1% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $320 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  30% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $2.4 billion;

Commercially viable phosphate\r\n  deposits were exhausted at the time of independence in 1979. Copra and fish\r\n  now represent the bulk of production and exports. The economy has fluctuated\r\n  widely in recent years. Real GDP declined about 8% in 1987, as the fish\r\n  catch fell sharply to only one-fourth the level of 1986 and copra production\r\n  was hampered by repeated rains. Output rebounded strongly in 1988, with real\r\n  GDP growing by 17%. The upturn in economic growth came from an increase in\r\n  copra production and a good fish catch. Following the strong surge in output\r\n  in 1988, GNP increased 1% in both 1989 and 1990.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $36.8 million (1990 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1% (1990 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $525 (1990 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  4.8% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $29.9 million;

agricultural land is\r\n  collectivized; and state-owned industry produces 95% of manufactured goods.\r\n  State control of economic affairs is unusually tight even for a Communist\r\n  country because of the small size and homogeneity of the society and the\r\n  strict rule of KIM Il-song and his son, KIM Chong-il. Economic growth during\r\n  the period 1984-88 averaged 2-3%, but output declined by 3-5% annually\r\n  during 1989-92 because of systemic problems and disruptions in\r\n  socialist-style economic relations with the former USSR and China. In 1992,\r\n  output dropped sharply, by perhaps 10-15%, as the economy felt the\r\n  cumulative effect of the reduction in outside support. The leadership\r\n  insisted in maintaining its high level of military outlays from a shrinking\r\n  economic pie. Moreover, a serious drawdown in inventories and critical\r\n  shortages in the energy sector have led to increasing interruptions in\r\n  industrial production. Abundant mineral resources and hydropower have formed\r\n  the basis of industrial development since WWII. Output of the extractive\r\n  industries includes coal, iron ore, magnesite, graphite, copper, zinc, lead,\r\n  and precious metals. Manufacturing is centered on heavy industry, including\r\n  military industry, with light industry lagging far behind. Despite the use\r\n  of improved seed varieties, expansion of irrigation, and the heavy use of\r\n  fertilizers, North Korea has not yet become self-sufficient in food\r\n  production. Five consecutive years of poor harvests, coupled with\r\n  distribution problems, have led to chronic food shortages. North Korea\r\n  remains far behind South Korea in economic development and living standards.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GNP - purchasing power equivalent - $22 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -10% to -15% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,000 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  NA%\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $18.5 billion;

Real GNP increased more than 10% annually between 1986 and 1991.\r\n  This growth ultimately led to an overheated situation characterized by a\r\n  tight labor market, strong inflationary pressures, and a rapidly rising\r\n  current account deficit. As a result, in 1992, focusing attention on slowing\r\n  the growth rate of inflation and reducing the deficit is leading to a\r\n  slow-down in growth. The economy remains the envy of the great majority of\r\n  the world's peoples.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GNP - purchasing power equivalent - $287 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  5% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $6,500 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  4.5% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  2.4% (1992 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $48.4 billion;

Industry,\r\n  concentrated around Bishkek, produces small quantities of electric motors,\r\n  livestock feeding equipment, washing machines, furniture, cement, paper, and\r\n  bricks. Mineral extraction is small, the most important minerals being coal,\r\n  rare earth metals and gold. Kyrgyzstan is a net importer of many types of\r\n  food and fuel but is a net exporter of electricity. In 1992, the Kirghiz\r\n  leadership made progress on reform, primarily by privatizing business,\r\n  granting life-long tenure to farmers, and freeing most prices. Nonetheless,\r\n  in 1992 overall industrial and livestock output declined because of acute\r\n  fuel shortages and a widespread lack of spare parts.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP $NA\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -25% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $NA\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  29% per month (first quarter 1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  0.1% includes officially registered unemployed;

In recent years, however, the government has been\r\n  decentralizing control and encouraging private enterprise. Laos is a\r\n  landlocked country with a primitive infrastructure; that is, it has no\r\n  railroads, a rudimentary road system, limited external and internal\r\n  telecommunications, and electricity available in only a limited area.\r\n  Subsistence agriculture is the main occupation, accounting for over 60% of\r\n  GDP and providing about 85-90% of total employment. The predominant crop is\r\n  rice. For the foreseeable future the economy will continue to depend for its\r\n  survival on foreign aid from the IMF and other international sources; aid\r\n  from the former USSR and Eastern Europe has been cut sharply.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $900 million (1991)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  4% (1991)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $200 (1991)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):   10% (1991)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  21% (1989 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $83 million;

Prices have been\r\n  freed, and privatization of shops and farms has begun. Latvia lacks natural\r\n  resources, aside from its arable land and small forests. Its most valuable\r\n  economic asset is its work force, which is better educated and disciplined\r\n  than in most of the former Soviet republics. Industrial production is highly\r\n  diversified, with products ranging from agricultural machinery to consumer\r\n  electronics. One conspicuous vulnerability: Latvia produces only 10% of its\r\n  electric power needs. Latvia in the near term must retain key commercial\r\n  ties to Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine while moving in the long run toward\r\n  joint ventures with technological support from, and trade ties to the West.\r\n  Because of the efficiency of its mostly individual farms, Latvians enjoy a\r\n  diet that is higher in meat, vegetables, and dairy products and lower in\r\n  grain and potatoes than diets in the 12 non-Baltic republics of the former\r\n  USSR. Good relations with Russia are threatened by animosity between ethnic\r\n  Russians (34% of the population) and native Latvians. The cumulative\r\n  difficulties in replacing old sources of supply and old markets, together\r\n  with the phasing out of the Russian ruble as the medium of exchange, help\r\n  account for the sharp 30% drop in GDP in 1992.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP $NA\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -30% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $NA\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  2% per month (first quarter 1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  3.6% (March 1993); but large numbers of underemployed workers\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $NA; expenditures $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\nExports:\r\n  $NA\r\n commodities:\r\n  NA\r\n partners:\r\n  NA\r\nImports:\r\n  $NA\r\n commodities:\r\n  NA\r\n partners:\r\n  NA\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $650 million (1991 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate -35% (1992 est.)\r\nElectricity:\r\n  2,140,000 kW capacity; 5,800 million kWh produced, 2,125 kWh per capita\r\n  (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  employs 33% of labor force; highly diversified; dependent on imports for\r\n  energy, raw materials, and intermediate products; produces buses, vans,\r\n  street and railroad cars, synthetic fibers, agricultural machinery,\r\n  fertilizers, washing machines, radios, electronics, pharmaceuticals,\r\n  processed foods, textiles\r\n\r\n*Latvia, Economy\r\n\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  employs 16% of labor force; principally dairy farming and livestock feeding;\r\n  products - meat, milk, eggs, grain, sugar beets, potatoes, vegetables;\r\n  fishing and fish packing\r\nIllicit drugs:\r\n  transshipment point for illicit drugs from Central and Southwest Asia to\r\n  Western Europe; limited producer of illicit opium; mostly for domestic\r\n  consumption; also produces illicit amphetamines for export\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  NA\r\nCurrency:\r\n  1 lat = 100 NA; introduced NA March 1993\r\nExchange rates:\r\n  lats per US$1 - 1.32 (March 1993)\r\nFiscal year:\r\n  calendar year\r\n\r\n*Latvia, Communications\r\n\r\nRailroads:\r\n  2,400 km; does not include industrial lines (1990)\r\nHighways:\r\n  59,500 km total; 33,000 km hard surfaced 26,500 km earth (1990)\r\nInland waterways:\r\n  300 km perennially navigable\r\nPipelines:\r\n  crude oil 750 km, refined products 780 km, natural gas 560 km (1992)\r\nPorts:\r\n  coastal - Riga, Ventspils, Liepaja; inland - Daugavpils\r\nMerchant marine:\r\n  96 ships (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 905,006 GRT/1,178,844 DWT; includes 14\r\n  cargo, 27 refrigerated cargo, 2 container, 9 roll-on/roll-off, 44 oil tanker\r\nAirports:\r\n total:\r\n  50\r\n useable:\r\n  15\r\n with permanent-surface runways:\r\n  11\r\n with runways over 3,659 m:\r\n  0\r\n with runways 2,440-3,659 m:\r\n  7\r\n with runways 1,220-2,439 m:\r\n  7\r\nTelecommunications:\r\n  NMT-450 analog cellular network is operational covering Riga, Ventspils,\r\n  Daugavpils, Rezekne, and Valmiera; broadcast stations - NA; international\r\n  traffic carried by leased connection to the Moscow international gateway\r\n  switch and through new independent international automatic telephone\r\n  exchange in Riga and the Finnish cellular net\r\n\r\n*Latvia, Defense Forces\r\n\r\nBranches:\r\n  Ground Forces, Navy, Air Force, Security Forces (internal and border\r\n  troops), Border Guard, Home Guard (Zemessardze)\r\nManpower availability:\r\n  males age 15-49 648,273; fit for military service 511,297; reach military\r\n  age (18) annually 18,767 (1993 est.)\r\nDefense expenditures:\r\n  176 million rubles, 3-5% of GDP; note - conversion of the military budget\r\n  into US$ using the current exchange rate could produce misleading results\r\n\r\n*Lebanon, Header\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n  Lebanon has made progress toward rebuilding its political institutions and\r\n  regaining its national sovereignty since the end of the devastating 16-year\r\n  civil war in October 1990. Under the Ta'if accord - the blueprint for\r\n  national reconciliation - the Lebanese have established a more equitable\r\n  political system, particularly by giving Muslims a greater say in the\r\n  political process. Since December 1990, the Lebanese have formed three\r\n  cabinets and conducted the first legislative election in 20 years. Most of\r\n  the militias have been weakened or disbanded. The Lebanese Armed Forces\r\n  (LAF) has seized vast quantities of weapons used by the militias during the\r\n  war and extended central government authority over about one-half of the\r\n  country. Hizballah, the radical Sh'ia party, is the only significant group\r\n  that retains most of its weapons. Foreign forces still occupy areas of\r\n  Lebanon. Israel continues to support a proxy militia, The Army of South\r\n  Lebanon (ASL), along a narrow stretch of territory contiguous to its border.\r\n  The ASL's enclave encompasses this self-declared security zone and about 20\r\n  kilometers north to the strategic town of Jazzine. As of December 1992,\r\n  Syria maintained about 30,000 troops in Lebanon. These troops are based\r\n  mainly in Beirut, North Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley. Syria's deployment\r\n  was legitimized by the Arab League early in Lebanon's civil war and in the\r\n  Ta'if accord. Citing the continued weakness of the LAF, Beirut's requests,\r\n  and failure of the Lebanese Government to implement all of the\r\n  constitutional reforms in the Ta'if accord, Damascus has so far refused to\r\n  withdraw its troops from Beirut.\r\n\r\n*Lebanon, Geography\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\n  Middle East, in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, between Israel and Syria\r\nMap references:\r\n  Africa, Middle East, Standard Time Zones of the World\r\nArea:\r\n total area:\r\n  10,400 km2\r\n land area:\r\n  10,230 km2\r\n comparative area:\r\n  about 0.8 times the size of Connecticut\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total 454 km, Israel 79 km, Syria 375 km\r\nCoastline:\r\n  225 km\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n territorial sea:\r\n  12 nm\r\nInternational disputes:\r\n  separated from Israel by the 1949 Armistice Line;

Following October\r\n  1990, however, a tentative peace has enabled the central government to begin\r\n  restoring control in Beirut, collect taxes, and regain access to key port\r\n  and government facilities. The battered economy has also been propped up by\r\n  a financially sound banking system and resilient small- and medium-scale\r\n  manufacturers. Family remittances, banking transactions, manufactured and\r\n  farm exports, the narcotics trade, and international emergency aid are main\r\n  sources of foreign exchange. In the relatively settled year of 1991,\r\n  industrial production, agricultural output, and exports showed substantial\r\n  gains. The further rebuilding of the war-ravaged country was delayed in 1992\r\n  because of an upturn in political wrangling. Hope for restoring economic\r\n  momentum in 1993 rests with the new, business-oriented Prime Minister\r\n  HARIRI.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $4.8 billion (1991 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,400 (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  100% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  35% (1991 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $533 million;

Its economy is based on agriculture, light\r\n  manufacturing, and remittances from laborers employed in South Africa ($439\r\n  million in 1991). The great majority of households gain their livelihoods\r\n  from subsistence farming and migrant labor. Manufacturing depends largely on\r\n  farm products to support the milling, canning, leather, and jute industries;\r\n  other industries include textile, clothing, and construction (in particular,\r\n  a major water improvement project which will permit the sale of water to\r\n  South Africa). Industry's share of GDP rose from 6% in 1982 to 15% in 1989.\r\n  Political and economic instability in South Africa raises uncertainty for\r\n  Lesotho's economy, especially with respect to migrant worker remittances -\r\n  recently the equivalent of nearly three-fourths of domestic output.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $620 million (1991 est.)\r\n note:\r\n  GNP of $1.0 billion (1991 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  5.3% (1991 est.);

Businessmen have fled the country,\r\n  taking capital and expertise with them. Many will not return. Richly endowed\r\n  with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to\r\n  agriculture, Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic products,\r\n  while local manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been small in scope.\r\n  Political instability threatens prospects for economic reconstruction and\r\n  repatriation of some 750,000 Liberian refugees who have fled to neighboring\r\n  countries. The political impasse between the interim government and rebel\r\n  leader Charles Taylor has prevented restoration of normal economic life,\r\n  including the re-establishment of a strong central government with effective\r\n  economic development programs.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $988 million (1988)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1.5% (1988)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $400 (1988)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  12% (1989)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  43% urban (1988)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $242.1 million;

In 1990 per capita GDP was the highest in Africa at\r\n  $5,410, but GDP growth rates have slowed and fluctuate sharply in response\r\n  to changes in the world oil market. Import restrictions and inefficient\r\n  resource allocations have led to shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs,\r\n  although the reopening of the Libyan-Tunisian border in April 1988 and the\r\n  Libyan-Egyptian border in December 1989 have eased shortages. Austerity\r\n  budgets and a lack of trained technicians have undermined the government's\r\n  ability to implement a number of planned infrastructure development\r\n  projects. Windfall revenues from the hike in world oil prices in late 1990\r\n  improved the foreign payments position and resulted in a current account\r\n  surplus for the first time in five years. The nonoil manufacturing and\r\n  construction sectors, which account for about 20% of GDP, have expanded from\r\n  processing mostly agricultural products to include petrochemicals, iron,\r\n  steel, and aluminum. Although agriculture accounts for only 5% of GDP, it\r\n  employs about 20% of the labor force. Climatic conditions and poor soils\r\n  severely limit farm output, and Libya imports about 75% of its food\r\n  requirements.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $26.1 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  0.2% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $5,800 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  7% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $8.1 billion;

Industry accounts for 53% of total employment, the service sector\r\n  45% (mostly based on tourism), and agriculture and forestry 2%. The sale of\r\n  postage stamps to collectors is estimated at $10 million annually. Low\r\n  business taxes (the maximum tax rate is 20%) and easy incorporation rules\r\n  have induced about 25,000 holding or so-called letter box companies to\r\n  establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein. Such companies, incorporated\r\n  solely for tax purposes, provide 30% of state revenues. The economy is tied\r\n  closely to Switzerland's economy in a customs union, and incomes and living\r\n  standards parallel those of the more prosperous Swiss groups.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $630 million (1990 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $22,300 (1990 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  5.4% (1990)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  1.5% (1990)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $259 million;

Although\r\n  it was substantially above average in living standards and technology in the\r\n  old USSR, Lithuania historically lagged behind Latvia and Estonia in\r\n  economic development. The country has no important natural resources aside\r\n  from its arable land and strategic location. Industry depends entirely on\r\n  imported materials that have come from the republics of the former USSR.\r\n  Lithuania benefits from its ice-free port at Klaipeda on the Baltic Sea and\r\n  its rail and highway hub at Vilnius, which provides land communication\r\n  between Eastern Europe and Russia, Latvia, Estonia, and Belarus. Industry\r\n  produces a small assortment of high-quality products, ranging from complex\r\n  machine tools to sophisticated consumer electronics. Because of nuclear\r\n  power, Lithuania is presently self-sufficient in electricity, exporting its\r\n  surplus to Latvia and Belarus; the nuclear facilities inherited from the\r\n  USSR, however, have come under world scrutiny as seriously deficient in\r\n  safety standards. Agriculture is efficient compared with most of the former\r\n  Soviet Union. Lithuania held first place in per capita consumption of meat,\r\n  second place for eggs and potatoes, and fourth place for milk and dairy\r\n  products. Grain must be imported to support the meat and dairy industries.\r\n  Lithuania is pressing ahead with plans to privatize at least 60% of\r\n  state-owned property (industry, agriculture, and housing), having already\r\n  sold almost all housing and many small enterprises using a voucher system.\r\n  Other government priorities include encouraging foreign investment by\r\n  protecting the property rights of foreign firms and redirecting foreign\r\n  trade away from Eastern markets to the more competitive Western markets. For\r\n  the moment, Lithuania will remain highly dependent on Russia for energy, raw\r\n  materials, grains, and markets for its products. In 1992, output plummeted\r\n  by 30% because of cumulative problems with inputs and with markets, problems\r\n  that were accentuated by the phasing out of the Russian ruble as the medium\r\n  of exchange.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP $NA\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -30% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $NA\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  10%-20% per month (first quarter 1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  1% (February 1993);

It will, however, move down toward a bare\r\n  subsistence level of life unless economic ties are reforged or enlarged with\r\n  its neighbors Serbia and Montenegro, Albania, Greece, and Bulgaria. The\r\n  economy depends on outside sources for all of its oil and gas and its modern\r\n  machinery and parts. Continued political turmoil, both internally and in the\r\n  region as a whole, prevents any swift readjustments of trade patterns and\r\n  economic programs. Inflation in early 1992 was out of control, the result of\r\n  fracturing trade links, the decline in economic activity, and general\r\n  uncertainties about the future status of the country; prices rose 38% in\r\n  March 1992 alone. In August 1992, Greece, angry at the use of \"Macedonia\" as\r\n  the republic's name, imposed a partial blockade for several months. This\r\n  blockade, combined with the effects of the UN sanctions on Serbia and\r\n  Montenegro, cost the economy approximately $1 billion in 1992 according to\r\n  official figures. Macedonia's geographical isolation, technological\r\n  backwardness, and potential political instability place it far down the list\r\n  of countries of interest to Western investors. Resolution of the dispute\r\n  with Greece and an internal commitment to economic reform would help to\r\n  encourage foreign investment over the long run. In the immediate future, the\r\n  worst scenario for the economy would be the spread of fighting across its\r\n  borders.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $7.1 billion (1991 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -18% (1991 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $3,110 (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  114.9% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  20% (1991 est.)\r\nBudget:   revenues $NA;

Agriculture,\r\n  including fishing and forestry, is the mainstay of the economy, accounting\r\n  for over 30% of GDP and contributing to more than 70% of total export\r\n  earnings. Industry is largely confined to the processing of agricultural\r\n  products and textile manufacturing; in 1991 it accounted for only 13% of\r\n  GDP. In 1986 the government introduced a five-year development plan that\r\n  stressed self-sufficiency in food (mainly rice) by 1990, increased\r\n  production for exports, and reduced energy imports. After mid-1991, however,\r\n  output dropped sharply because of protracted antigovernment strikes and\r\n  demonstrations for political reform.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $2.5 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $200 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  20% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:   NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $250 million;

Agriculture is\r\n  limited to the production of a few subsistence crops that provide only 10%\r\n  of food requirements. Fishing is the largest industry, employing 25% of the\r\n  work force and accounting for over 60% of exports; it is also an important\r\n  source of government revenue. During the 1980s tourism became one of the\r\n  most important and highest growth sectors of the economy. In 1988 industry\r\n  accounted for about 5% of GDP. Real GDP is officially estimated to have\r\n  increased by about 10% annually during the period 1974-90.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $140 million (1991 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  4.7% (1991 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $620 (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  11.5% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NEGL%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $52 million (excluding foreign transfers);

Malta produces only about 20% of its food needs, has\r\n  limited freshwater supplies, and has no domestic energy sources.\r\n  Consequently, the economy is highly dependent on foreign trade and services.\r\n  Manufacturing and tourism are the largest contributors to the economy.\r\n  Manufacturing accounts for about 27% of GDP, with the electronics and\r\n  textile industries major contributors and the state-owned Malta drydocks\r\n  employing about 4,300 people. In 1991, about 900,000 tourists visited the\r\n  island. Per capita GDP at $7,600 places Malta in the middle-income range of\r\n  the world's nations.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $2.7 billion (1991 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  5.9% (1991)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $7,600 (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  2.9% (1991)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  3.6% (1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $1.1 billion;

Agricultural\r\n  production is concentrated on small farms, and the most important commercial\r\n  crops are coconuts, tomatoes, melons, and breadfruit. A few cattle ranches\r\n  supply the domestic meat market. Small-scale industry is limited to\r\n  handicrafts, fish processing, and copra. The tourist industry is the primary\r\n  source of foreign exchange and employs about 10% of the labor force. The\r\n  islands have few natural resources, and imports far exceed exports. In 1987\r\n  the US Government provided grants of $40 million out of the Marshallese\r\n  budget of $55 million.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $63 million (1989 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,500 (1989 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  NA%\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $55 million;

Sugar production has declined, with most of the sugarcane now used\r\n  for the production of rum. Banana exports are increasing, going mostly to\r\n  France. The bulk of meat, vegetable, and grain requirements must be\r\n  imported, contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual\r\n  transfers of aid from France. Tourism has become more important than\r\n  agricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange. The majority of the\r\n  work force is employed in the service sector and in administration. Banana\r\n  workers launched protests late in 1992 because of falling banana prices and\r\n  fears of greater competition in the European market from other producers.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $2 billion (1988)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $6,000 (1988)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  3.9% (1990)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  32.1% (1990)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $268 million;

The decline in world demand for this ore, however, has led\r\n  to cutbacks in production. The nation's coastal waters are among the richest\r\n  fishing areas in the world, but overexploitation by foreigners threatens\r\n  this key source of revenue. The country's first deepwater port opened near\r\n  Nouakchott in 1986. In recent years, the droughts, the endemic conflict with\r\n  Senegal, rising energy costs, and economic mismanagement have resulted in a\r\n  substantial buildup of foreign debt. The government has begun the second\r\n  stage of an economic reform program in consultation with the World Bank, the\r\n  IMF, and major donor countries. But the reform process suffered a major\r\n  setback following the Gulf war of early 1991. Because of Mauritania's\r\n  support of SADDAM Husayn, bilateral aid from its two top donors, Saudi\r\n  Arabia and Kuwait, was suspended, and multilateral aid was reduced.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $1.1 billion (1991 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  3% (1991 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $555 (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  6.2% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  20% (1991 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $280 million;

In the 1980s, Mexico experienced severe economic\r\n  difficulties: the nation accumulated large external debts as world petroleum\r\n  prices fell; rapid population growth outstripped the domestic food supply;\r\n  and inflation, unemployment, and pressures to emigrate became more acute.\r\n  Growth in national output, however, has recovered, rising from 1.4% in 1988\r\n  to 4% in 1990 and 3.6% in 1991 and coming in at 2.6% in 1992. The US is\r\n  Mexico's major trading partner, accounting for almost three-quarters of its\r\n  exports and imports. After petroleum, border assembly plants and tourism are\r\n  the largest earners of foreign exchange. The government, in consultation\r\n  with international economic agencies, has been implementing programs to\r\n  stabilize the economy and foster growth. For example, it has privatized more\r\n  than two-thirds of its state-owned companies (parastatals), including banks.\r\n  In 1991-92 the government conducted negotiations with the US and Canada on a\r\n  North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which was still being discussed\r\n  by the three countries in early 1993. In January 1993, Mexico replaced its\r\n  old peso with a new peso, at the rate of 1,000 old to 1 new peso.\r\n  Notwithstanding the palpable improvements in economic performance in the\r\n  early 1990s, Mexico faces substantial problems for the remainder of the\r\n  decade - e.g., rapid population growth, unemployment, and serious pollution,\r\n  particularly in Mexico City.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $328 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  2.6% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $3,600 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  11.9% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  14%-17% (1991 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $58.9 billion;

Moldova has a little more than 1% of the population,\r\n  labor force, capital stock, and output of the former Soviet Union. Living\r\n  standards have been below average for the European USSR. The country enjoys\r\n  a favorable climate, and economic development has been primarily based on\r\n  agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and tobacco. Industry\r\n  accounts for 20% of the labor force, whereas agriculture employs more than\r\n  one-third. Moldova has no major mineral resources and has depended on other\r\n  former Soviet republics for coal, oil, gas, steel, most electronic\r\n  equipment, machine tools, and major consumer durables such as automobiles.\r\n  Its industrial and agricultural products, in turn, have been exported to the\r\n  other republics. Moldova has freed prices on most goods and has legalized\r\n  private ownership of property. Moldova's near-term economic prospects are\r\n  dimmed, however, by the difficulties of moving toward a market economy, the\r\n  political problems of redefining ties to the other former Soviet republics\r\n  and Romania, and the ongoing separatist movements in the Dniester and Gagauz\r\n  regions. In 1992, national output fell substantially for the second\r\n  consecutive year - down 22% in the industrial sector and 20% in agriculture.\r\n  The decline is mainly attributable to the drop in energy supplies.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP $NA\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -26% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $NA\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):   27% per month (first quarter 1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  0.7% (includes only officially registered unemployed;

The Principality has\r\n  successfully sought to diversify into services and small, high-value-added,\r\n  nonpolluting industries. The state has no income tax and low business taxes\r\n  and thrives as a tax haven both for individuals who have established\r\n  residence and for foreign companies that have set up businesses and offices.\r\n  About 50% of Monaco's annual revenue comes from value-added taxes on hotels,\r\n  banks, and the industrial sector; about 25% of revenue comes from tourism.\r\n  Living standards are high, that is, roughly comparable to those in\r\n  prosperous French metropolitan suburbs.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $475 million (1991 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $16,000 (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  NA%\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NEGL%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $424 million;

Economic activity\r\n  traditionally has been based on agriculture and the breeding of livestock -\r\n  Mongolia has the highest number of livestock per person in the world. In\r\n  recent years extensive mineral resources have been developed with Soviet\r\n  support. The mining and processing of coal, copper, molybdenum, tin,\r\n  tungsten, and gold account for a large part of industrial production. Timber\r\n  and fishing are also important sectors. In 1992 the Mongolian leadership\r\n  continued its struggle with severe economic dislocations, mainly\r\n  attributable to the crumbling of the USSR, by far Mongolia's leading trade\r\n  and development partner. Moscow cut almost all aid in 1991, and little was\r\n  provided in 1992. Industry in 1992 was hit hard by energy shortages, mainly\r\n  due to disruptions in coal production and shortfalls in petroleum imports.\r\n  By the end of the year, the country was perilously close to a complete\r\n  shutdown of its centralized energy supply system, due to critical coal\r\n  shortages. The government is moving away from the Soviet-style, centrally\r\n  planned economy through privatization and price reform.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $1.8 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -15% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $800 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  325% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  15% (1991 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  deficit of $67 million (1991)\r\nExports:\r\n  $347 million (f.o.b., 1991 est.)\r\n commodities:\r\n  copper, livestock, animal products, cashmere, wool, hides, fluorspar, other\r\n  nonferrous metals\r\n partners:\r\n  USSR 75%, China 10%, Japan 4%\r\nImports:\r\n  $501 million (f.o.b., 1991 est.)\r\n commodities:\r\n  machinery and equipment, fuels, food products, industrial consumer goods,\r\n  chemicals, building materials, sugar, tea\r\n partners:\r\n  USSR 75%, Austria 5%, China 5%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $16.8 billion (yearend 1990);

Economic performance in 1991 was mixed. A record harvest helped\r\n  real GDP advance by 4.2%. Inflation accelerated slightly as easier financial\r\n  policies triggered rapid credit and monetary growth. Despite recovery of\r\n  domestic demand, import volume growth slowed while export volume was\r\n  adversely affected by phosphate marketing difficulties. In January 1992,\r\n  Morocco reached a new 12-month standby arrangement for $129 million with the\r\n  IMF. In February 1992, the Paris Club rescheduled $1.4 billion of Morocco's\r\n  commercial debt. This is thought to be Morocco's last rescheduling. By 1993\r\n  the Moroccan authorities hope to be in a position to meet all debt service\r\n  obligations without additional rescheduling. Servicing this large debt, high\r\n  unemployment, and Morocco's vulnerability to external economic forces remain\r\n  severe long-term problems. In 1992 Morocco embarked on a program to\r\n  privatize 112 state-owned companies.

Indeed, national output, consumption, and\r\n  investment declined throughout the first half of the 1980s because of\r\n  internal disorders, lack of government administrative control, and a growing\r\n  foreign debt. A sharp increase in foreign aid, attracted by an economic\r\n  reform policy, resulted in successive years of economic growth in the late\r\n  1980s, but aid has declined steadily since 1989. Agricultural output,\r\n  nevertheless, is at about only 75% of its 1981 level, and grain has to be\r\n  imported. Industry operates at only 20-40% of capacity. The economy depends\r\n  heavily on foreign assistance to keep afloat. The continuation of civil\r\n  strife has dimmed chances of foreign investment, and growth was a mere 0.3%\r\n  in 1992. Living standards, already abysmally low, fell further in 1991-92.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $1.75 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  0.3% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $115 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  50% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  50% (1989 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $252 million;

Mining accounts for almost 25% of GDP. Namibia\r\n  is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals in Africa and the world's\r\n  fifth-largest producer of uranium. Alluvial diamond deposits are among the\r\n  richest in the world, making Namibia a primary source for gem-quality\r\n  diamonds. Namibia also produces large quantities of lead, zinc, tin, silver,\r\n  and tungsten.

Industrial activity is\r\n  limited, mainly involving the processing of agricultural produce (jute,\r\n  sugarcane, tobacco, and grain). Production of textiles and carpets has\r\n  expanded recently and accounted for 85% of foreign exchange earnings in\r\n  FY91. Apart from agricultural land and forests, exploitable natural\r\n  resources are mica, hydropower, and tourism. Agricultural production in the\r\n  late 1980s grew by about 5%, as compared with annual population growth of\r\n  2.6%. More than 40% of the population is undernourished partly because of\r\n  poor distribution. The top 10% of the population receives 47% of total\r\n  income, the bottom 20% less than 5% of the total. Since May 1991, the\r\n  government has been encouraging trade and foreign investment, e.g., by\r\n  eliminating business licenses and registration requirements in order to\r\n  simplify domestic and foreign investment. The government also has been\r\n  cutting public expenditures by reducing subsides, privatizing state\r\n  industries, and laying off civil servants. Prospects for foreign trade and\r\n  investment in the 1990s remain poor, however, because of the small size of\r\n  the economy, its technological backwardness, and its remoteness.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $3.4 billion (FY92)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  3.1% (FY92)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $170 (FY92)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  14% (November 1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  5% (1987);

The trade and financial services sector contributes over 50% of\r\n  GDP. Industrial activity provides about 25% of GDP and is led by the\r\n  food-processing, oil-refining, and metalworking industries. The highly\r\n  mechanized agricultural sector employs only 5% of the labor force, but\r\n  provides large surpluses for export and the domestic food-processing\r\n  industry.

The government has hoped that dynamic growth\r\n  would boost real incomes, broaden and deepen the technological capabilities\r\n  of the industrial sector, reduce inflationary pressures, and permit the\r\n  expansion of welfare benefits. The results have been mixed: inflation is\r\n  down from double-digit levels, but growth was sluggish in 1988-91, and\r\n  unemployment, always a highly sensitive issue, has exceeded 10% since May\r\n  1991.

In early 1993, fewer than\r\n  50% of the agricultural and industrial firms remain state owned. Sandinista\r\n  economic policies and the war had produced a severe economic crisis. The\r\n  foundation of the economy continues to be the export of agricultural\r\n  commodities, largely coffee and cotton. Farm production fell by roughly 7%\r\n  in 1989 and 4% in 1990, and remained about even in 1991-92. The agricultural\r\n  sector employs 44% of the work force and accounts for 15% of GDP and 80% of\r\n  export earnings. Industry, which employs 13% of the work force and\r\n  contributes about 25% to GDP, showed a drop of 7% in 1989, fell slightly in\r\n  1990, and remained flat in 1991-92; output still is below pre-1979 levels.\r\n  External debt is one of the highest in the world on a per capita basis.

The economy also\r\n  depends heavily on exploitation of large uranium deposits. Uranium\r\n  production grew rapidly in the mid-1970s, but tapered off in the early 1980s\r\n  when world prices declined. France is a major customer, while Germany,\r\n  Japan, and Spain also make regular purchases. The depressed demand for\r\n  uranium has contributed to an overall sluggishness in the economy, a severe\r\n  trade imbalance, and a mounting external debt.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $2.3 billion (1991 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1.9% (1991 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $290 (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  1.3% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $193 million;

In 1991-92 massive government spending, much of\r\n  it to help ensure a smooth transition to civilian rule, ballooned the budget\r\n  deficit and caused inflation and interest rates to rise. The lack of fiscal\r\n  discipline forced the IMF to declare Nigeria not in compliance with an\r\n  18-month standby facility started in January 1991. Lagos has set ambitious\r\n  targets for expanding oil production capacity and is offering foreign\r\n  companies more attractive investment incentives. Government efforts to\r\n  reduce Nigeria's dependence on oil exports and to sustain noninflationary\r\n  growth, however, have fallen short because of inadequate new investment\r\n  funds and endemic corruption. Living standards remain below the level of the\r\n  early 1980s oil boom.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $35 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  3.6% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $300 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  60% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  28% (1992 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $9 billion;

Government\r\n  expenditures regularly exceed revenues, with the shortfall made up by grants\r\n  from New Zealand - the grants are used to pay wages to public employees. The\r\n  agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening, although some\r\n  cash crops are grown for export. Industry consists primarily of small\r\n  factories to process passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The\r\n  sale of postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of\r\n  revenue. The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of\r\n  population because of migration of Niueans to New Zealand.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GNP - exchange rate conversion - $2.1 million (1989 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,000 (1989 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  9.6% (1984)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $5.5 million;

The government controls key areas, such as the\r\n  vital petroleum sector (through large-scale state enterprises) and\r\n  extensively subsidizes agriculture, fishing, and areas with sparse\r\n  resources. Norway also maintains an extensive welfare system that helps\r\n  propel public sector expenditures to slightly more than 50% of the GDP and\r\n  results in one of the highest average tax burdens in the world (54%). A\r\n  small country with a high dependence on international trade, Norway is\r\n  basically an exporter of raw materials and semiprocessed goods, with an\r\n  abundance of small- and medium-sized firms, and is ranked among the major\r\n  shipping nations. The country is richly endowed with natural resources -\r\n  petroleum, hydropower, fish, forests, and minerals - and is highly dependent\r\n  on its oil sector to keep its economy afloat. Although one of the\r\n  government's main priorities is to reduce this dependency, this situation is\r\n  not likely to improve for years to come. The government also hopes to reduce\r\n  unemployment and strengthen and diversify the economy through tax reform and\r\n  a series of expansionary budgets. The budget deficit is expected to hit a\r\n  record 8% of GDP because of welfare spending and bail-outs of the banking\r\n  system. Unemployment continues at record levels of over 10% - including\r\n  those in job programs - because of the weakness of the economy outside the\r\n  oil sector. Overall economic growth is expected to be around 2% in 1993\r\n  while inflation is likely to rise slightly to 4%. Oslo, a member of the\r\n  European Free Trade Area, has applied for EC membership and continues to\r\n  deregulate and harmonize with EC regulations to prepare for the European\r\n  Economic Area (EEA) - which creates an EC/EFTA market with free movement of\r\n  capital, goods, services, and labor - to take effect in late 1993 and its EC\r\n  bid.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $76.1 billion (1992)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  2.9% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $17,700 (1992)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  2.3% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  5.9% (excluding people in job-training programs) (1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $50.6 billion;

It provides\r\n  low-cost sea transportation between East and West, extensive fishing\r\n  grounds, offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and sand and gravel for the\r\n  construction industry. In 1985 over half (54%) of the world's total fish\r\n  catch came from the Pacific Ocean, which is the only ocean where the fish\r\n  catch has increased every year since 1978. Exploitation of offshore oil and\r\n  gas reserves is playing an ever-increasing role in the energy supplies of\r\n  Australia, New Zealand, China, US, and Peru. The high cost of recovering\r\n  offshore oil and gas, combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil\r\n  since 1985, has slowed but not stopped new drillings.\r\nIndustries:\r\n  fishing, oil and gas production\r\n\r\n*Pacific Ocean, Communications\r\n\r\nPorts:\r\n  Bangkok (Thailand), Hong Kong, Los Angeles (US), Manila (Philippines), Pusan\r\n  (South Korea), San Francisco (US), Seattle (US), Shanghai (China),\r\n  Singapore, Sydney (Australia), Vladivostok (Russia), Wellington (NZ),\r\n  Yokohama (Japan)\r\nTelecommunications:\r\n  several submarine cables with network nodal points on Guam and Hawaii\r\n\r\n*Pakistan, Geography\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\n  South Asia, along the Arabian Sea, between India and Afghanistan\r\nMap references:\r\n  Asia, Standard Time Zones of the World\r\nArea:\r\n total area:\r\n  803,940 km2\r\n land area:\r\n  778,720 km2\r\n comparative area:\r\n  slightly less than twice the size of California\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total 6,774 km, Afghanistan 2,430 km, China 523 km, India 2,912 km, Iran 909\r\n  km\r\nCoastline:\r\n  1,046 km\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n contiguous zone:\r\n  24 nm\r\n continental shelf:\r\n  200 nm or the edge of continental margin\r\n exclusive economic zone:\r\n  200 nm\r\n territorial sea:\r\n  12 nm\r\nInternational disputes:\r\n  status of Kashmir with India;

In addition, the economy must support a large\r\n  military establishment. A real economic growth rate averaging 5-6% in recent\r\n  years has helped the country to cope with these problems. Almost all\r\n  agriculture and small-scale industry is in private hands. In 1990, Pakistan\r\n  embarked on a sweeping economic liberalization program to boost foreign and\r\n  domestic private investment and lower foreign aid dependence. The SHARIF\r\n  government denationalized several state-owned firms and attracted some\r\n  foreign investment. Pakistan likely will have difficulty raising living\r\n  standards because of its rapidly expanding population. At the current rate\r\n  of growth, population would double in 25 years.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GNP - exchange rate conversion - $48.3 billion (FY92 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  6.4% (FY92 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $410 (FY92 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  12.7% (FY91)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  10% (FY91 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $9.4 billion;

Paraguay\r\n  lacks substantial mineral or petroleum resources but does have a large\r\n  hydropower potential. Since 1981 economic performance has declined compared\r\n  with the boom period of 1976-81, when real GDP grew at an average annual\r\n  rate of nearly 11%. During the period 1982-86 real GDP fell in three of five\r\n  years, inflation jumped to an annual rate of 32%, and foreign debt rose.\r\n  Factors responsible for the erratic behavior of the economy were the\r\n  completion of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam, bad weather for crops, and weak\r\n  international commodity prices for agricultural exports. In 1987 the economy\r\n  experienced a minor recovery because of improved weather conditions and\r\n  stronger international prices for key agricultural exports. The recovery\r\n  continued through 1990, on the strength of bumper crops in 1988-89. In a\r\n  major step to increase its economic activity in the region, Paraguay in\r\n  March 1991 joined the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), which includes\r\n  Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. In 1992, the government, through an\r\n  unorthodox approach, reduced external debt with both commercial and official\r\n  creditors by purchasing a sizable amount of the delinquent commercial debt\r\n  in the secondary market at a substantial discount. The government had paid\r\n  100% of remaining official debt arrears to the US, Germany, France, and\r\n  Spain. All commercial debt arrears have been rescheduled. For the long run,\r\n  the government must press forward with general, market-oriented economic\r\n  reforms.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $7.3 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1.7% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,500 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  20% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  10% (1992 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $1.2 billion;

In\r\n  the 1980s the economy suffered from hyperinflation, declining per capita\r\n  output, and mounting external debt. Peru was shut off from IMF and World\r\n  Bank support in the mid-1980s because of its huge debt arrears. An austerity\r\n  program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government took office in\r\n  July 1990 contributed to a third consecutive yearly contraction of economic\r\n  activity, but the slide halted late that year, and output rose 2.4% in 1991.\r\n  After a burst of inflation as the austerity program eliminated government\r\n  price subsidies, monthly price increases eased to the single-digit level and\r\n  by December 1991 dropped to the lowest increase since mid-1987. Lima\r\n  obtained a financial rescue package from multilateral lenders in September\r\n  1991, although it faced $14 billion in arrears on its external debt. By\r\n  working with the IMF and World Bank on new financial conditions and\r\n  arrangements, the government succeeded in ending its arrears by March 1993.\r\n  In 1992, GDP fell by 2.8%, in part because a warmer-than-usual El Nino\r\n  current resulted in a 30% drop in the fish catch. Meanwhile, revival of\r\n  growth in GDP continued to be restricted by the large amount of public and\r\n  private resources being devoted to strengthening internal security.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $25 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -2.8% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,100 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  56.7% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  15% (1992 est.);

Drought and power supply problems hampered production,\r\n  while inadequate revenues prevented government pump priming. Despite a flat\r\n  GDP performance, GNP mustered a small 0.6% expansion, attributable to\r\n  inflows of workers' remittances combined with smaller foreign interest\r\n  payments. A marked increase in capital goods imports, particularly power\r\n  generations equipment, telecommunications equipment, and electronic data\r\n  processors, contributed to a 20.5% import growth in 1992.

As a result, consumer goods shortages and\r\n  lines disappeared, and inflation fell from 640% in 1989 to 44% in 1992.\r\n  Western governments, which hold two-thirds of Poland's $48 billion external\r\n  debt, pledged in 1991 to forgive half of Poland's official debt by 1994. The\r\n  private sector accounted for 29% of industrial production and nearly half of\r\n  nonagricultural output in 1992. Production fell in state enterprises,\r\n  however, and the unemployment rate climbed steadily from virtually nothing\r\n  in 1989 to 13.6% in December 1992. Poland fell out of compliance with its\r\n  IMF program by mid-1991, and talks with commercial creditors stalled. The\r\n  increase in unemployment and the decline in living standards led to strikes\r\n  in the coal, auto, copper, and railway sectors in 1992. Large state\r\n  enterprises in the coal, steel, and defense sectors plan to halve employment\r\n  over the next decade, and the government expects unemployment to reach 3\r\n  million (16%) in 1993. A shortfall in tax revenues caused the budget deficit\r\n  to reach 6% of GDP in 1992, but industrial production began a slow, uneven\r\n  upturn. In 1993, the government will struggle to win legislative approval\r\n  for faster privatization and to keep the budget deficit within IMF-approved\r\n  limits.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $167.6 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  2% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $4,400 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  44% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  13.6% (December 1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $17.5 billion;

To prepare for the European single market, the government is\r\n  restructuring and modernizing the economy and in 1989 embarked on a major\r\n  privatization program. As of 1 January 1993, Lisbon has fully liberalized\r\n  its capital markets and most trade markets. The global slowdown and tight\r\n  monetary policies to counter inflation caused growth to slow in 1991 and\r\n  1992.

Important industries include pharmaceuticals,\r\n  electronics, textiles, petrochemicals, and processed foods. Sugar production\r\n  has lost out to dairy production and other livestock products as the main\r\n  source of income in the agricultural sector. Tourism has traditionally been\r\n  an important source of income for the island, with estimated arrivals of\r\n  nearly 3 million tourists in 1989.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GNP - purchasing power equivalent - $22.8 billion (1991)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  2.2% (FY90)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $6,200 (1991)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  1.3% (October 1990-91)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  17% (1992 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $5.8 billion;

Sugarcane has been\r\n  the primary crop for more than a century, and in some years it accounts for\r\n  85% of exports. The government has been pushing the development of a tourist\r\n  industry to relieve high unemployment, which recently amounted to one-third\r\n  of the labor force. The gap in Reunion between the well-off and the poor is\r\n  extraordinary and accounts for the persistent social tensions. The white and\r\n  Indian communities are substantially better off than other segments of the\r\n  population, often approaching European standards, whereas indigenous groups\r\n  suffer the poverty and unemployment typical of the poorer nations of the\r\n  African continent. The outbreak of severe rioting in February 1991\r\n  illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic tensions. The economic\r\n  well-being of Reunion depends heavily on continued financial assistance from\r\n  France.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $3.37 billion (1987 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  9% (1987 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $6,000 (1987 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  1.3% (1988)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  35% (February 1991)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $358 million;

The year 1991 witnessed a 17% drop in\r\n  industrial production because of energy and input shortages and labor\r\n  unrest. In recent years the agricultural sector has had to contend with\r\n  flooding, mismanagement, shortages of inputs, and disarray caused by the\r\n  dismantling of cooperatives. A shortage of inputs and a severe drought in\r\n  1991 contributed to a poor harvest, a problem compounded by corruption and\r\n  an obsolete distribution system. The new government has instituted moderate\r\n  land reforms, with more than one-half of cropland now in private hands, and\r\n  it has liberalized private agricultural output. Private enterprises form an\r\n  increasingly important portion of the economy largely in services,\r\n  handicrafts, and small-scale industry. Little progress on large scale\r\n  privatization has been made since a law providing for the privatization of\r\n  large state firms was passed in August 1991. Most of the large state firms\r\n  have been converted into joint-stock companies, but the selling of shares\r\n  and assets to private owners has been delayed. While the government has\r\n  halted the old policy of diverting food from domestic consumption to hard\r\n  currency export markets, supplies remain scarce in some areas. The new\r\n  government continues to impose price ceilings on key consumer items. In 1992\r\n  the economy muddled along toward the new, more open system, yet output and\r\n  living standards continued to fall.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $63.4 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -15% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $2,700 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  200% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  9% (January 1993)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $19 billion;

President\r\n  YEL'TSIN's government made significant strides toward a market economy in\r\n  1992 by freeing most prices, slashing defense spending, unifying foreign\r\n  exchange rates, and launching an ambitious privatization program. At the\r\n  same time, GDP fell 19%, according to official statistics, largely\r\n  reflecting government efforts to restructure the economy, shortages of\r\n  essential imports caused by the breakdown in former Bloc and interstate\r\n  trade, and reduced demand following the freeing of prices in January. The\r\n  actual decline, however, may have been less steep, because industrial and\r\n  agricultural enterprises had strong incentives to understate output to avoid\r\n  taxes, and official statistics may not have fully captured the output of the\r\n  growing private sector. Despite the large drop in output, unemployment at\r\n  yearend stood at an estimated 3%-4% of Russia's 74-million-person labor\r\n  force; many people, however, are working shortened weeks or are on forced\r\n  leave. Moscow's financial stabilization program got off to a good start at\r\n  the beginning of 1992 but began to falter by midyear. Under pressure from\r\n  industrialists and the Supreme Soviet, the government loosened fiscal\r\n  policies in the second half. In addition, the Russian Central Bank relaxed\r\n  its tight credit policy in July at the behest of new Acting Chairman, Viktor\r\n  GERASHCHENKO. This loosening of financial policies led to a sharp increase\r\n  in prices during the last quarter, and inflation reached about 25% per month\r\n  by yearend. The situation of most consumers worsened in 1992. The January\r\n  price liberalization and a blossoming of private vendors filled shelves\r\n  across the country with previously scarce food items and consumer goods, but\r\n  wages lagged behind inflation, making such goods unaffordable for many\r\n  consumers. Falling real wages forced most Russians to spend a larger share\r\n  of their income on food and to alter their eating habits. Indeed, many\r\n  Russians reduced their consumption of higher priced meat, fish, milk,\r\n  vegetables, and fruit, in favor of more bread and potatoes. As a result of\r\n  higher spending on food, consumers reduced their consumption of nonfood\r\n  goods and services. Despite a slow start and some rough going, the Russian\r\n  government by the end of 1992 scored some successes in its campaign to break\r\n  the state's stranglehold on property and improve the environment for private\r\n  businesses. More peasant farms were created than expected; the number of\r\n  consumers purchasing goods from private traders rose sharply; the portion of\r\n  the population working in the private sector increased to nearly one-fifth;\r\n  and the nine-month-long slump in the privatization of small businesses was\r\n  ended in the fall. Although the output of weapons fell sharply in 1992, most\r\n  defense enterprises continued to encounter numerous difficulties developing\r\n  and marketing consumer products, establishing new supply links, and securing\r\n  resources for retooling. Indeed, total civil production by the defense\r\n  sector fell in 1992 because of shortages of inputs and lower consumer demand\r\n  caused by higher prices. Ruptured ties with former trading partners, output\r\n  declines, and sometimes erratic efforts to move to world prices and\r\n  decentralize trade - foreign and interstate - took a heavy toll on Russia's\r\n  commercial relations with other countries. For the second year in a row,\r\n  foreign trade was down sharply, with exports falling by as much as 25% and\r\n  imports by 21%. The drop in imports would have been much greater if foreign\r\n  aid - worth an estimated $8 billion - had not allowed the continued inflow\r\n  of essential products. Trade with the other former Soviet republics\r\n  continued to decline, and support for the ruble as a common currency eroded\r\n  in the face of Moscow's loose monetary policies and rapidly rising prices\r\n  throughout the region. At the same time, Russia paid only a fraction of the\r\n  $20 billion due on the former USSR's roughly $80 billion debt; debt\r\n  rescheduling remained hung up because of a dispute between Russia and\r\n  Ukraine over division of the former USSR's assets. Capital flight also\r\n  remained a serious problem in 1992. Russia's economic difficulties did not\r\n\r\n*Russia, Economy\r\n\r\n  abate in the first quarter of 1993. Monthly inflation remained at\r\n  double-digit levels and industrial production continued to slump. To reduce\r\n  the threat of hyperinflation, the government proposed to restrict subsidies\r\n  to enterprises; raise interest rates; set quarterly limits on credits, the\r\n  budget deficit, and money supply growth; and impose temporary taxes and cut\r\n  spending if budget targets are not met. But many legislators and Central\r\n  Bank officials oppose various of these austerity measures and failed to\r\n  approve them in the first part of 1993.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP $NA\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -19% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $NA\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  25% per month (December 1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  3%-4% of labor force (1 January 1993 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $NA;

The amount of fertile land is limited, however, and\r\n  deforestation and soil erosion have created problems. The industrial sector\r\n  in Rwanda is small, contributing only 17% to GDP. Manufacturing focuses\r\n  mainly on the processing of agricultural products. The Rwandan economy\r\n  remains dependent on coffee exports and foreign aid. Weak international\r\n  prices since 1986 have caused the economy to contract and per capita GDP to\r\n  decline. A structural adjustment program with the World Bank began in\r\n  October 1990.

The\r\n  economy has been declining, however, because the number of ships stopping at\r\n  Saint Pierre has dropped steadily over the years. In March 1989, an\r\n  agreement between France and Canada set fish quotas for Saint Pierre's\r\n  trawlers fishing in Canadian and Canadian-claimed waters for three years.\r\n  The agreement settles a longstanding dispute that had virtually brought fish\r\n  exports to a halt.

Since then, however, cocoa production has\r\n  gradually deteriorated because of drought and mismanagement, so that by 1987\r\n  output had fallen to less than 50% of its former levels. As a result, a\r\n  shortage of cocoa for export has created a serious balance-of-payments\r\n  problem. Production of less important crops, such as coffee, copra, and palm\r\n  kernels, has also declined. The value of imports generally exceeds that of\r\n  exports by a ratio of 4:1. The emphasis on cocoa production at the expense\r\n  of other food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import 90% of food needs.\r\n  It also has to import all fuels and most manufactured goods. Over the years,\r\n  Sao Tome has been unable to service its external debt, which amounts to\r\n  roughly 80% of export earnings. Considerable potential exists for\r\n  development of a tourist industry, and the government has taken steps to\r\n  expand facilities in recent years. The government also implemented a\r\n  Five-Year Plan covering 1986-90 to restructure the economy and reschedule\r\n  external debt service payments in cooperation with the International\r\n  Development Association and Western lenders.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $41.4 million (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1.5% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $315 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  27% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $10.2 million;

The situation in Serbia and\r\n  Montenegro remains fluid in view of the extensive political and military\r\n  strife. Serbia and Montenegro faces major economic problems. First, like the\r\n  other former Yugoslav republics, it depended on its sister republics for\r\n  large amounts of foodstuffs, energy supplies, and manufactures. Wide\r\n  varieties in climate, mineral resources, and levels of technology among the\r\n  republics accentuate this interdependence, as did the Communist practice of\r\n  concentrating much industrial output in a small number of giant plants. The\r\n  breakup of many of the trade links, the sharp drop in output as industrial\r\n  plants lost suppliers and markets, and the destruction of physical assets in\r\n  the fighting all have contributed to the economic difficulties of the\r\n  republics. One singular factor in the economic situation of Serbia and\r\n  Montenegro is the continuation in office of a Communist government that is\r\n  primarily interested in political and military mastery, not economic reform.\r\n  A further complication is the imposition of economic sanctions by the UN.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $27-37 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $2,500-$3,500 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  81% (1991)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  25%-40% (1991 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $NA;

Subsistence\r\n  agriculture dominates the economy, generating about one-third of GDP and\r\n  employing about two-thirds of the working population. Manufacturing, which\r\n  accounts for roughly 10% of GDP, consists mainly of the processing of raw\r\n  materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic market. Diamond mining\r\n  provides an important source of hard currency. The economy suffers from high\r\n  unemployment, rising inflation, large trade deficits, and a growing\r\n  dependency on foreign assistance. The government in 1990 was attempting to\r\n  get the budget deficit under control and, in general, to bring economic\r\n  policy in line with the recommendations of the IMF and the World Bank. Since\r\n  March 1991, however, military incursions by Liberian rebels in southern and\r\n  eastern Sierra Leone have severely strained the economy and have undermined\r\n  efforts to institute economic reforms.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $1.4 billion (FY92 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -1% (FY92 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $330 (FY92 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  5% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $68 million;

The economy appears to have pulled off a soft landing\r\n  from the 9% growth rate of the late 1980s, registering higher than expected\r\n  growth in 1992 while stemming inflation. Economic activity slowed early in\r\n  1992, primarily as a result of slackened demand in Singapore's export\r\n  markets. But after bottoming out in the second quarter, the economy picked\r\n  up in line with a gradual recovery in the United States. The year's best\r\n  performers were the construction and financial services industries and\r\n  manufacturers of computer-related components. Rising labor costs continue to\r\n  be a threat to Singapore's competitiveness, but there are indications that\r\n  productivity is catching up. Government surpluses and the rate of gross\r\n  national savings remain high. In technology, per capita output, and labor\r\n  discipline, Singapore is well on its way toward its goal of becoming a\r\n  developed country.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $45.9 billion (1992)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  5.8% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $16,500 (1992)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  2.3% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  2.7% (June 1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $10.4 billion;

The old Czechoslovakia, even\r\n  though highly industrialized by East European standards, suffered from an\r\n  aging capital plant, lagging technology, and a deficiency in energy and many\r\n  raw materials. In January 1991, approximately one year after the end of\r\n  communist control of Eastern Europe, the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic\r\n  launched a sweeping program to convert its almost entirely state-owned and\r\n  controlled economy to a market system. In 1991-92 these measures resulted in\r\n  privatization of some medium- and small-scale economic activity and the\r\n  setting of more than 90% of prices by the market - but at a cost in\r\n  inflation, unemployment, and lower output. For Czechoslovakia as a whole\r\n  inflation in 1991 was roughly 50% and output fell 15%. In 1992 in Slovakia,\r\n  inflation slowed to an estimated 8.7% and the estimated fall in GDP was a\r\n  more moderate 7%. In 1993 the government anticipates up to a 7% drop in GDP,\r\n  with the disruptions from the separation from the Czech lands probably\r\n  accounting for half the decline; inflation, according to government\r\n  projections, may rise to 15-20% and unemployment may reach 12-15%. The\r\n  Slovak government is moving ahead less enthusiastically than the Czech\r\n  government in the further dismantling of the old centrally controlled\r\n  economic system. Although the governments of Slovakia and the Czech Republic\r\n  had envisaged retaining the koruna as a common currency at least in the\r\n  short run, the two countries ended the currency union in February 1993.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $32.1 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -7% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $6,100 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  8.7% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  11.3% (1992 est.)\r\nBudget:   revenues $NA;

Because of its strong\r\n  ties to Western Europe and the small scale of damage during its fight for\r\n  independence from Yugoslavia, Slovenia has the brightest prospects among the\r\n  former Yugoslav republics for economic recovery over the next few years. The\r\n  dissolution of Yugoslavia, however, has led to severe short-term\r\n  dislocations in production, employment, and trade ties. For example, overall\r\n  industrial production fell 10% in 1991; particularly hard hit were the iron\r\n  and steel, machine-building, chemical, and textile industries. Meanwhile,\r\n  the continued fighting in other former Yugoslavian republics has led to\r\n  further destruction of long-established trade channels and to an influx of\r\n  tens of thousands of Croatian and Bosnian refugees. The key program for\r\n  breaking up and privatizing major industrial firms was established in late\r\n  1992. Bright spots for encouraging Western investors are Slovenia's\r\n  comparatively well-educated work force, its developed infrastructure, and\r\n  its Western business attitudes, but instability in Croatia is a deterrent.\r\n  Slovenia in absolute terms is a small economy, and a little Western\r\n  investment would go a long way.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $21 billion (1991 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -10% (1991 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $10,700 (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  2.7% (September 1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  10% (April 1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $NA;

Moreover, much of the economy has been devastated by the civil\r\n  war. Agriculture is the most important sector, with livestock accounting for\r\n  about 40% of GDP and about 65% of export earnings. Nomads and seminomads who\r\n  are dependent upon livestock for their livelihoods make up more than half of\r\n  the population. Crop production generates only 10% of GDP and employs about\r\n  20% of the work force. The main export crop is bananas; sugar, sorghum, and\r\n  corn are grown for the domestic market. The small industrial sector is based\r\n  on the processing of agricultural products and accounts for less than 10% of\r\n  GDP. Greatly increased political turmoil in 1991-92 has resulted in a\r\n  substantial drop in output, with widespread famine.\r\nNational product:\r\n  $NA\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $NA\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  NA%\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $NA; expenditures $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\nExports:\r\n  $NA\r\n commodities:\r\n  bananas, livestock, fish, hides, skins\r\n partners:\r\n  Saudi Arabia, Italy, FRG (1986)\r\nImports:\r\n  $NA\r\n commodities:\r\n  petroleum products, foodstuffs, construction materials\r\n partners:\r\n  US 13%, Italy, FRG, Kenya, UK, Saudi Arabia (1986)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $1.9 billion (1989)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate NA%, accounts for NA% of GDP\r\nElectricity:\r\n  former public power capacity of 75,000 kW is completely shut down by the\r\n  destruction of the civil war; UN, relief organizations, and foreign military\r\n  units in Somalia use their own portable power systems\r\nIndustries:\r\n  a few small industries, including sugar refining, textiles, petroleum\r\n  refining; probably shut down by the widespread destruction during the civil\r\n  war\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  dominant sector, led by livestock raising (cattle, sheep, goats); crops -\r\n  bananas, sorghum, corn, mangoes, sugarcane; not self-sufficient in food;\r\n  distribution of food disrupted by civil strife; fishing potential largely\r\n  unexploited\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-89), $639 million; Western (non-US)\r\n  countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments (1970-89), $3.8 billion; OPEC\r\n  bilateral aid (1979-89), $1.1 billion; Communist countries (1970-89), $336\r\n  million\r\n\r\n*Somalia, Economy\r\n\r\nCurrency:\r\n  1 Somali shilling (So.

In contrast, most of the remaining population suffers from\r\n  the poverty patterns of the Third World, including unemployment and lack of\r\n  job skills. The main strength of the economy lies in its rich mineral\r\n  resources, which provide two-thirds of exports. Economic developments in the\r\n  1990s will be driven partly by the changing relations among the various\r\n  ethnic groups. The shrinking economy in recent years has absorbed less than\r\n  10% of the more than 300,000 workers entering the labor force annually.\r\n  Local economists estimate that the economy must grow between 5% and 6% in\r\n  real terms annually to absorb all of the new entrants.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $115 billion (1992)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -2% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $2,800 (1992)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  13.9% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  45% (well over 50% in some homeland areas) (1992 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $28 billion;

Foreign and domestic\r\n  investments have spurred GDP growth at an annual average of more than 4% in\r\n  1986-91. As of 1 January 1993, Spain has wholly liberalized its trade and\r\n  capital markets to EC standards, including integrating agriculture two years\r\n  ahead of schedule. Beginning in 1989, Madrid implemented a tight monetary\r\n  policy to fight 7% inflation. As a result of this action and the worldwide\r\n  decline in economic growth, Spain's growth rate declined to 1% in 1992.\r\n  Spain faces a likely recession in first half 1993. The government expects a\r\n  recovery in the second half, but this depends on stepped-up growth in\r\n  Germany and France. The slowdown in growth - along with displacements caused\r\n  by structural adjustments in preparation for the EC single market - has\r\n  pushed an already high unemployment rate up to 19%. However, many people\r\n  listed as unemployed work in the underground economy. If the government can\r\n  stick to its tough economic policies and push further structural reforms,\r\n  the economy will emerge stronger at the end of the 1990s.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $514.9 billion (1992)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $13,200 (1992)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  6% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  19% (yearend 1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $122.9 billion;

The economy is dominated by\r\n  governmental entities that account for more than 70% of new investment. The\r\n  private sector's main areas of activity are agriculture and trading, with\r\n  most private industrial investment predating 1980. The economy's base is\r\n  agriculture, which employs 80% of the work force. Industry mainly processes\r\n  agricultural items. Sluggish economic performance over the past decade,\r\n  attributable largely to declining annual rainfall, has reduced levels of per\r\n  capita income and consumption. A large foreign debt and huge arrearages\r\n  continue to cause difficulties. In 1990 the International Monetary Fund took\r\n  the unusual step of declaring Sudan noncooperative because of its nonpayment\r\n  of arrearages to the Fund. Despite subsequent government efforts to\r\n  implement reforms urged by the IMF and the World Bank, the economy remained\r\n  stagnant in FY91 as entrepreneurs lack the incentive to take economic risks.\r\n  Growth in 1992 was featured by the recovery of agricultural production in\r\n  northern Sudan after two years of drought.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $5.2 billion (FY92 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  9% (FY92 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $184 (FY92 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  150% (FY92 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  30% (FY92 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $1.3 billion;

A drop in world bauxite prices\r\n  which started in the late 1970s and continued until late 1986 was followed\r\n  by the outbreak of a guerrilla insurgency in the interior that crippled the\r\n  important bauxite sector. Although the insurgency has since ebbed and the\r\n  bauxite sector recovered, a military coup in December 1990 reflected\r\n  continued political instability and deterred investment and economic reform.\r\n  High inflation, high unemployment, widespread black market activity, and\r\n  hard currency shortfalls continue to mark the economy.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $1.35 billion (1991 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -2.5% (1991 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $3,300 (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  26% (1991)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  16.5% (1990)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $466 million;

By treaty (9\r\n  February 1920), the nationals of the treaty powers have equal rights to\r\n  exploit mineral deposits, subject to Norwegian regulation. Although US, UK,\r\n  Dutch, and Swedish coal companies have mined in the past, the only companies\r\n  still mining are Norwegian and Russian. The settlements on Svalbard are\r\n  essentially company towns. The Norwegian state-owned coal company employs\r\n  nearly 60% of the Norwegian population on the island, runs many of the local\r\n  services, and provides most of the local infrastructure. There is also some\r\n  trapping of seal, polar bear, fox, and walrus.\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $13.3 million; expenditures $13.3 million, including capital\r\n  expenditures of $NA (1990)\r\nElectricity:\r\n  21,000 kW capacity;

Manufacturing, which includes\r\n  a number of agroprocessing factories, accounts for another quarter of GDP.\r\n  Mining has declined in importance in recent years; high-grade iron ore\r\n  deposits were depleted in 1978, and health concerns cut world demand for\r\n  asbestos. Exports of sugar and forestry products are the main earners of\r\n  hard currency. Surrounded by South Africa, except for a short border with\r\n  Mozambique, Swaziland is heavily dependent on South Africa, from which it\r\n  receives 75% of its imports and to which it sends about half of its exports.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $700 million (1991 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  2.5% (1991 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $800 (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  13% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $342 million;

It has\r\n  a modern distribution system, excellent internal and external\r\n  communications, and a skilled labor force. Timber, hydropower, and iron ore\r\n  constitute the resource base of an economy that is heavily oriented toward\r\n  foreign trade. Privately owned firms account for about 90% of industrial\r\n  output, of which the engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and\r\n  exports. In the last few years, however, this extraordinarily favorable\r\n  picture has been clouded by inflation, growing unemployment, and a gradual\r\n  loss of competitiveness in international markets. Although Prime Minister\r\n  BILDT'S center-right minority coalition had hoped to charge ahead with\r\n  free-market-oriented reforms, a skyrocketing budget deficit - almost 13% of\r\n  GDP in FY94 projections - and record unemployment have forestalled many of\r\n  the plans. Unemployment in 1993 is forecast at around 7% with another 5% in\r\n  job training. Continued heavy foreign exchange speculation forced the\r\n  government to cooperate in late 1992 with the opposition Social Democrats on\r\n  two crisis packages - one a severe austerity pact and the other a program to\r\n  spur industrial competitiveness - which basically set economic policy\r\n  through 1997. In November 1992, Sweden broke its tie to the EC's ECU, and\r\n  the krona has since depreciated around 2.5% against the dollar. The\r\n  government hopes the boost in export competitiveness from the depreciation\r\n  will help lift Sweden out of its 3-year recession. To curb the budget\r\n  deficit and bolster confidence in the economy, BILDT continues to propose\r\n  cuts in welfare benefits, subsidies, defense, and foreign aid. Sweden\r\n  continues to harmonize its economic policies with those of the EC in\r\n  preparation for concluding its EC membership bid by 1995.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $145.6 billion (1992)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -1.7% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $16,900 (1992)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  2.3% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:   5.3% (1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $70.4 billion;

Stubborn inflation and a soft\r\n  economy have afflicted Switzerland. Despite slow growth in 1991-92, the\r\n  Swiss central bank had been unable to ease monetary policy in the past three\r\n  years because of the threat to the Swiss franc posed by high German interest\r\n  rates. As a result, unemployment is forecast to rise from 3% in 1992 to more\r\n  than 4% in 1993, with inflation moving down from 4% to 3%. The voters'\r\n  rejection in December 1992 of a referendum on membership in the EEA which\r\n  was supported by most political, business, and financial leaders has raised\r\n  doubts that the country can maintain its preeminent prosperity and\r\n  leadership in commercial banking in the 21st century. Despite these\r\n  problems, Swiss per capita output, general living standards, education and\r\n  science, health care, and diet remain unsurpassed in Europe.

Economic\r\n  growth averaged nearly 12% annually in 1990-91, buoyed by increased oil\r\n  production and improved agricultural performance. The Gulf war of early 1991\r\n  provided Syria an aid windfall of nearly $5 billion dollars from Arab,\r\n  European, and Japanese donors. These inflows more than offset Damascus's\r\n  war-related costs and will help Syria cover some of its debt arrears,\r\n  restore suspended credit lines, and initiate selected military and civilian\r\n  purchases. In 1992 the government spurred economic development by loosening\r\n  controls on domestic and foreign investment while maintaining strict\r\n  political controls. For the long run, Syria's economy is still saddled with\r\n  a large number of poorly performing public sector firms and industrial and\r\n  agricultural productivity is poor. A major long-term concern is the\r\n  additional drain of upstream Euphrates water by Turkey when its vast dam and\r\n  irrigation projects are completed by mid-decade.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $30 billion (1991 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  9% (1991 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $2,300 (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):   20% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  5.7% (1989)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $5.4 billion;

Real growth in GNP has averaged about\r\n  9% a year during the past three decades. Export growth has been even faster\r\n  and has provided the impetus for industrialization. Agriculture contributes\r\n  about 4% to GNP, down from 35% in 1952. Taiwan currently ranks as number 13\r\n  among major trading countries. Traditional labor-intensive industries are\r\n  steadily being replaced with more capital- and technology-intensive\r\n  industries.

The economy is\r\n  heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for about 58% of GDP,\r\n  provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work force. Industry\r\n  accounts for 8% of GDP and is mainly limited to processing agricultural\r\n  products and light consumer goods. The economic recovery program announced\r\n  in mid-1986 has generated notable increases in agricultural production and\r\n  financial support for the program by bilateral donors. The World Bank, the\r\n  International Monetary Fund, and bilateral donors have provided funds to\r\n  rehabilitate Tanzania's deteriorated economic infrastructure. Growth in\r\n  1991-92 featured a pickup in industrial production and a substantial\r\n  increase in output of minerals led by gold.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $7.2 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  4.5% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $260 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  22% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $495 million;

Thailand, one of the more\r\n  advanced developing countries in Asia, depends on exports of manufactures\r\n  and the development of the service sector to fuel the country's rapid\r\n  growth. The trade and current account deficits fell in 1992; much of\r\n  Thailand's recent imports have been for capital equipment suggesting that\r\n  the export sector is poised for further growth. With foreign investment\r\n  slowing, Bangkok is working to increase the generation of capital\r\n  domestically. Prime Minister CHUAN's government - Thailand's fifth\r\n  government in less than two years - is pledged to continue Bangkok's\r\n  probusiness policies, and the return of a democratically elected government\r\n  has improved business confidence. Nevertheless, CHUAN must overcome\r\n  divisions within his ruling coalition to complete much needed infrastructure\r\n  development programs if Thailand is to remain an attractive place for\r\n  business investment. Over the longer-term, Bangkok must produce more college\r\n  graduates with technical training and upgrade workers' skills to continue\r\n  its rapid economic development.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $103 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  7% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,800 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  4.5% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  4.7% (1992 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $21.36 billion;

Togo is self-sufficient in\r\n  basic foodstuffs when harvests are normal. In the industrial sector\r\n  phosphate mining is by far the most important activity, with phosphate\r\n  exports accounting for about 40% of total foreign exchange earnings. Togo\r\n  serves as a regional commercial and trade center. The government, over the\r\n  past decade, with IMF and World Bank support, has been implementing a number\r\n  of economic reform measures to encourage foreign investment and bring\r\n  revenues in line with expenditures. Political unrest, including private and\r\n  public sector strikes throughout 1991 and 1992, has jeopardized the reform\r\n  program and has disrupted vital economic activity.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $1.5 billion (1991 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  0% (1991 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $400 (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  0.5% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  2% (1987)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $284.8 million;

Tourism is the primary source of hard\r\n  currency earnings, but the island remains dependent on sizable external aid\r\n  and remittances to offset its trade deficit.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $92 million (FY90)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  0.4% (FY92 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $900 (FY90)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  4% (FY92 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $36.4 million;

The economy fell sharply through\r\n  most of the 1980s, largely because of the decline in oil prices. This sector\r\n  accounts for 80% of export earnings and almost 20% of GDP. The government,\r\n  in response to the oil revenue loss, pursued a series of austerity measures\r\n  that pushed the unemployment rate as high as 22% in 1988. The economy showed\r\n  signs of recovery in 1990 and 1991, however, helped along by rising oil\r\n  prices. Agriculture employs only about 11% of the labor force and produces\r\n  about 3% of GDP. Since this sector is small, it has been unable to absorb\r\n  the large numbers of the unemployed. The government currently seeks to\r\n  diversify its export base.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $5 billion (1991)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  2.6% (1991)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $3,800 (1991)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  3.8% (1991)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  18.5% (1991)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $1.6 billion; expenditures $1.6 billion, including capital\r\n  expenditures of $158 million (1993 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $2.2 billion (f.o.b., 1991)\r\n commodities:\r\n  includes reexports - petroleum and petroleum products 82%, steel products\r\n  9%, fertilizer, sugar, cocoa, coffee, citrus (1988)\r\n partners:\r\n  US 49%, CARICOM 12%\r\nImports:\r\n  $1.7 billion (c.i.f., 1991)\r\n commodities:\r\n  raw materials and intermediate goods 48%, capital goods 29%, consumer goods\r\n  23% (1991)\r\n partners:\r\n  US 39%, Venezuela 14%, UK 7%, CARICOM 5% (1991)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $2.4 billion (1991)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 2.3%, excluding oil refining (1986);

Following two years of drought-induced economic\r\n  decline, the economy came back strongly in 1990-92 as a result of good\r\n  harvests, continued export growth, and higher domestic investment.

Strong consumer demand and\r\n  increased public investment led the way to a strong 5.9% growth in 1992.\r\n  Chronic high inflation is Turkey's most serious economic problem, leading to\r\n  high interest rates and the rapid depreciation of the Turkish lira. The huge\r\n  public sector deficit - about 12% of GDP - and the Treasury's heavy reliance\r\n  on Central Bank financing of the deficit are the major causes of Turkish\r\n  inflation. Meanwhile, wage increases in both the public and private sector\r\n  have outpaced productivity gains, limited the government's ability to reduce\r\n  current expenditures, and hindered the return to profitability of many\r\n  private companies. Agriculture remains an important economic sector,\r\n  employing about half of the work force, contributing 18% to GDP, and\r\n  accounting for about 20% of exports. The government has launched a\r\n  multibillion-dollar development program in the southeastern region, which\r\n  includes the building of a dozen dams on the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers to\r\n  generate electric power and irrigate large tracts of farmland. The Turkish\r\n  economy will probably continue to grow faster than the West European average\r\n  in 1993, but the shaky coalition government of Prime Minister DEMIREL -\r\n  which has seen its parliamentary majority shrink from 36 to 11 seats during\r\n  its first year in power - is unlikely to risk further erosion of its support\r\n  by implementing the belt-tightening measures necessary to substantially\r\n  reduce inflation.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $219 billion (1992)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  5.9% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $3,670 (1992)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  70% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  11.1% (1992 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $40.5 billion;

This process\r\n  requires wholesale changes in supply sources, markets, property rights, and\r\n  monetary arrangements. Industry - with 10% of the labor force - is heavily\r\n  weighted toward the energy sector, which produced 11% of the ex-USSR's gas\r\n  and 1% of its oil. Turkmenistan ranked second among the former Soviet\r\n  republics in cotton production, mainly in the irrigated western region,\r\n  where the huge Karakumskiy Canal taps the Amu Darya. The general decline in\r\n  national product accelerated in 1992, principally because of inability to\r\n  obtain spare parts and disputes with customers over the price of natural\r\n  gas.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP $NA\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -10% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $NA\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  53% per month (first quarter 1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  15%-20% (1992 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $NA;

The economy has\r\n  been devastated by widespread political instability, mismanagement, and\r\n  civil war since independence in 1962, keeping Uganda poor with a per capita\r\n  income of about $300. (GDP remains below the levels of the early 1970s, as\r\n  does industrial production.) Agriculture is the most important sector of the\r\n  economy, employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee is the major export\r\n  crop and accounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986 the government\r\n  has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking currency\r\n  reform, raising producer prices on export crops, increasing prices of\r\n  petroleum products, and improving civil service wages. The policy changes\r\n  are especially aimed at dampening inflation, which was running at over 300%\r\n  in 1987, and boosting production and export earnings. In 1990-92, the\r\n  economy has turned in a solid performance based on continued investment in\r\n  the rehabilitation of infrastructure, improved incentives for production and\r\n  exports, and gradually improving domestic security.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $6 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  4% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $300 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  41.5% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $365 million;

Its fertile black soil\r\n  generated more than one fourth of Soviet agricultural output, and its farms\r\n  provided substantial quantities of meat, milk, grain and vegetables to other\r\n  republics. Likewise, its well-developed and diversified heavy industry\r\n  supplied equipment and raw materials to industrial and mining sites in other\r\n  regions of the former USSR. In 1992 the Ukrainian government liberalized\r\n  most prices and erected a legal framework for privatizing state enterprises\r\n  while retaining many central economic controls and continuing subsidies to\r\n  state production enterprises. In November 1992 the new Prime Minister KUCHMA\r\n  launched a new economic reform program promising more freedom to the\r\n  agricultural sector, faster privatization of small and medium enterprises,\r\n  and stricter control over state subsidies. Even so, the magnitude of the\r\n  problems and the slow pace in building new market-oriented institutions\r\n  preclude a near-term recovery of output to the 1990 level.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP $NA\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -13% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $NA\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  20%-30% per month (first quarter 1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $NA;

The economy is\r\n  essentially capitalistic; over the past thirteen years the ruling Tories\r\n  have greatly reduced public ownership and contained the growth of social\r\n  welfare programs. Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient\r\n  by European standards, producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the\r\n  labor force. The UK has large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves, and\r\n  primary energy production accounts for 12% of GDP, one of the highest shares\r\n  of any industrial nation. Services, particularly banking, insurance, and\r\n  business services, account by far for the largest proportion of GDP while\r\n  industry continues to decline in importance, now employing only 25% of the\r\n  work force and generating 21% of GDP. The economy is emerging out of its\r\n  3-year recession with only weak recovery expected in 1993. Unemployment is\r\n  hovering around 10% of the labor force. The government in 1992 adopted a\r\n  pro-growth strategy, cutting interest rates sharply and removing the pound\r\n  from the European exchange rate mechanism. Excess industrial capacity\r\n  probably will moderate inflation which for the first time in a decade is\r\n  below the EC average. The major economic policy question for Britain in the\r\n  1990s is the terms on which it participates in the financial and economic\r\n  integration of Europe.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $920.6 billion (1992)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -0.6% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $15,900 (1992)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  3.6% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  9.8% (1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $367.6 billion;

The economy is market oriented with most decisions made\r\n  by private individuals and business firms and with government purchases of\r\n  goods and services made predominantly in the marketplace. In 1989 the\r\n  economy enjoyed its seventh successive year of substantial growth, the\r\n  longest in peacetime history. The expansion featured moderation in wage and\r\n  consumer price increases and a steady reduction in unemployment to 5.2% of\r\n  the labor force. In 1990, however, growth slowed to 1% because of a\r\n  combination of factors, such as the worldwide increase in interest rates,\r\n  Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August, the subsequent spurt in oil prices, and\r\n  a general decline in business and consumer confidence. In 1991 output fell\r\n  by 1%, unemployment grew, and signs of recovery proved premature. Growth\r\n  picked up to 2.1% in 1992. Unemployment, however, remained at nine million,\r\n  the increase in GDP being mainly attributable to gains in output per worker.\r\n  Ongoing problems for the 1990s include inadequate investment in economic\r\n  infrastructure, rapidly rising medical costs, and sizable budget and trade\r\n  deficits.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $5.951 trillion (1992)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  2.1% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $23,400 (1992)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  3% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  7% (April 1993)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $1,092 billion;

Economic development has been held back by excessive\r\n  government regulation of economic detail and 50% to 130% inflation. After\r\n  several years of sluggish growth, real GDP jumped by about 8% in 1992. The\r\n  rise is attributable mainly to an increase in Argentine demand for Uruguayan\r\n  exports, particularly agricultural products and electricity. In a major step\r\n  toward greater regional economic cooperation, Uruguay in 1991 had joined\r\n  Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay in forming the Southern Cone Common Market\r\n  (Mercosur). A referendum in December 1992 overturned key portions of\r\n  landmark privatization legislation, dealing a serious blow to President\r\n  LACALLE's broad economic reform plan.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $9.8 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  8% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $3,100 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  58% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  9% (1992 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $2.9 billion;

Moscow's push for ever-increasing amounts of cotton had\r\n  included massive irrigation projects which caused extensive environmental\r\n  damage to the Aral Sea and rivers of the republic. Furthermore, the lavish\r\n  use of chemical fertilizers has caused extensive pollution and widespread\r\n  health problems. Recently the republic has sought to encourage food\r\n  production at the expense of cotton. The small industrial sector specializes\r\n  in such items as agricultural machinery, mineral fertilizers, vegetable oil,\r\n  and bridge cranes. Uzbekistan also has some important natural resources\r\n  including gold (about 30% of former Soviet production), uranium, and natural\r\n  gas. The Uzbek Government has encouraged some land reform but has shied away\r\n  from other aspects of economic reform. Output and living standards continued\r\n  to fall in 1992 largely because of the cumulative impact of disruptions in\r\n  supply that have followed the dismemberment of the USSR.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP $NA\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -10% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $NA\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  at least 17% per month (first quarter 1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  0.1% includes only officially registered unemployed;

President\r\n  PEREZ introduced an economic readjustment program when he assumed office in\r\n  February 1989. Lower tariffs and the removal of price controls, a free\r\n  market exchange rate, and market-linked interest rates threw the economy\r\n  into confusion, causing an 8% decline in GDP in 1989.

Most prices are now fully decontrolled and the Vietnamese currency\r\n  has been effectively devalued and floated at world market rates. In\r\n  addition, the scope for private sector activity has been expanded, primarily\r\n  through decollectivization of the agricultural sector and introduction of\r\n  laws giving legal recognition to private business. Despite such positive\r\n  indicators, the country's economic turnaround remains tenuous. Nearly\r\n  three-quarters of export earnings are generated by only two commodities,\r\n  rice and crude oil. Meanwhile, industrial production stagnates, burdened by\r\n  uncompetitive state-owned enterprises the government is unwilling or unable\r\n  to privatize. Unemployment looms as the most serious problem with over 25%\r\n  of the workforce without jobs and population growth swelling the ranks of\r\n  the unemployed yearly.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GNP - exchange rate conversion - $16 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  7.4% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $230 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  15%-20% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  25% (1992 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $1.7 billion;

As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and reaffirmed by\r\n  President Bush's post-Gulf crisis peace initiative, the final status of the\r\n  West Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors, and a\r\n  peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the\r\n  concerned parties. Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will\r\n  resolve the respective boundaries. Pending the completion of this process,\r\n  it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip\r\n  has yet to be determined. In the view of the US, the term West Bank\r\n  describes all of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian\r\n  administration before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. However, with respect to\r\n  negotiations envisaged in the framework agreement, it is US policy that a\r\n  distinction must be made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank\r\n  because of the city's special status and circumstances. Therefore, a\r\n  negotiated solution for the final status of Jerusalem could be different in\r\n  character from that of the rest of the West Bank.\r\n\r\n*West Bank, Geography\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\n  Middle East, between Jordan and Israel\r\nMap references:\r\n  Middle East\r\nArea:\r\n total area:\r\n  5,860 km2\r\n land area:\r\n  5,640 km2\r\n comparative area:\r\n  slightly larger than Delaware\r\n note:\r\n  includes West Bank, East Jerusalem, Latrun Salient, Jerusalem No Man's Land,\r\n  and the northwest quarter of the Dead Sea, but excludes Mt.

Capital investment consists largely of residential housing, not\r\n  productive assets that would enable local firms to compete with Israeli\r\n  industry. A major share of GNP is derived from remittances of workers\r\n  employed in Israel and Persian Gulf states, but such transfers from the Gulf\r\n  dropped dramatically after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. In the wake\r\n  of the Persian Gulf crisis, many Palestinians have returned to the West\r\n  Bank, increasing unemployment, and export revenues have plunged because of\r\n  the loss of markets in Jordan and the Gulf states. Israeli measures to\r\n  curtail the intifadah also have pushed unemployment up and lowered living\r\n  standards.

Average growth of\r\n  1.5% in the GDP of industrialized countries (62% of GWP in 1992) and average\r\n  growth of 5% in the GDP of less developed countries (30% of GWP) were offset\r\n  by a further 15-20% drop in the GDP of the former Soviet-East European area\r\n  (now only 8% of GWP). The United States accounted for 23% of GWP in 1992;\r\n  the 12-member European Community, which established a single internal market\r\n  on 1 January 1993, accounted for another 23%, and Japan accounted for 10%.\r\n  These are the three \"economic superpowers\" presumably destined to compete\r\n  for mastery in international markets on into the 21st century. In general,\r\n  growth in the industrialized countries was sluggish in 1992, with\r\n  unemployment typically at 7-11%. As for the less developed countries, China,\r\n  India, and the Four Dragons--South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and\r\n  Singapore--posted good records; however, many other countries, especially in\r\n  Africa, suffered bitterly from drought, rapid population growth, and civil\r\n  strife. The continued plunge in production in practically all the former\r\n  Warsaw Pact economies strained the political and social fabric of these\r\n  newly independent nations, in particular in Russia. The addition of nearly\r\n  100 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating\r\n  the problems of pollution, desertification, underemployment, epidemics, and\r\n  famine. Because of their own internal problems, the industrialized countries\r\n  have inadequate resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the\r\n  world, which, at least from the economic point of view, are becoming further\r\n  marginalized. (For the specific economic problems of each country, see the\r\n  individual country entries in this volume.)\r\nNational product:\r\n  GWP (gross world product) - purchasing power equivalent - $25.6 trillion\r\n  (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  0.5% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $4,600 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n developed countries:\r\n  5% (1992 est.)\r\n developing countries:\r\n  50% (1992 est.)\r\n note:\r\n  these figures vary widely in individual cases\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  developed countries typically 7-11%;

11,450,000 million kWh produced, 2,150 kWh per\r\n  capita (1990)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  industry worldwide is dominated by the onrush of technology, especially in\r\n  computers, robotics, telecommunications, and medicines and medical\r\n  equipment; most of these advances take place in OECD nations; only a small\r\n  portion of non-OECD countries have succeeded in rapidly adjusting to these\r\n  technological forces, and the technological gap between the industrial\r\n  nations and the less-developed countries continues to widen; the rapid\r\n  development of new industrial (and agricultural) technology is complicating\r\n  already grim environmental problems\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  the production of major food crops has increased substantially in the last\r\n  20 years; the annual production of cereals, for instance, has risen by 50%,\r\n  from about 1.2 billion metric tons to about 1.8 billion metric tons;\r\n  production increases have resulted mainly from increased yields rather than\r\n  increases in planted areas; while global production is sufficient for\r\n  aggregate demand, about one-fifth of the world's population remains\r\n  malnourished, primarily because local production cannot adequately provide\r\n  for large and rapidly growing populations, which are too poor to pay for\r\n  food imports; conditions are especially bad in Africa where drought in\r\n  recent years has intensified the consequences of overpopulation\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  NA\r\n\r\n*World, Communications\r\n\r\nRailroads:\r\n  239,430 km of narrow gauge track;

Future economic development depends heavily\r\n  on Western-assisted development of promising oil resources. Former South\r\n  Yemen's willingness to merge stemmed partly from the steady decline in\r\n  Soviet economic support. The low level of domestic industry and agriculture\r\n  have made northern Yemen dependent on imports for virtually all of its\r\n  essential needs. Large trade deficits have been compensated for by\r\n  remittances from Yemenis working abroad and by foreign aid. Once\r\n  self-sufficient in food production, northern Yemen has become a major\r\n  importer. Land once used for export crops - cotton, fruit, and vegetables -\r\n  has been turned over to growing qat, a mildly narcotic shrub chewed by\r\n  Yemenis which has no significant export market. Oil export revenues started\r\n  flowing in late 1987 and boosted 1988 earnings by about $800 million.\r\n  Economic growth in former South Yemen has been constrained by a lack of\r\n  incentives, partly stemming from centralized control over production\r\n  decisions, investment allocation, and import choices.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $8 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:   NA%\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $775 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  100% (December 1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  30% (December 1992)\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $NA, expenditures $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\nExports:\r\n  $908 million (f.o.b., 1990 est.)\r\n commodities:\r\n  crude oil, cotton, coffee, hides, vegetables, dried and salted fish\r\n partners:\r\n  US, EC countries, South Korea, Saudi Arabia\r\nImports:\r\n  $2.1 billion (f.o.b., 1990 est.)\r\n commodities:\r\n  textiles and other manufactured consumer goods, petroleum products, sugar,\r\n  grain, flour, other foodstuffs, cement, machinery, chemicals\r\n partners:\r\n  Japan, Saudi Arabia, Australia, EC countries, China, Russia, US\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $5.75 billion (December 1989 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate NA%, accounts for 18% of GDP\r\nElectricity:\r\n  714,000 kW capacity;

While meaningful\r\n  economic figures are difficult to come by, Zaire's hyperinflation, the\r\n  largest government deficit ever, and plunging mineral production have made\r\n  the country one of the world's poorest. Most formal transactions are\r\n  conducted in hard currency as indigenous banknotes have lost almost all\r\n  value, and a barter economy now flourishes in all but the largest cities.\r\n  Most individuals and families hang on grimly through subsistence farming and\r\n  petty trade. The government has not been able to meet its financial\r\n  obligations to the International Momentary Fund or put in place the\r\n  financial measures advocated by the IMF. Although short-term prospects for\r\n  improvement are dim, improved political stability would boost Zaire's\r\n  long-term potential to effectively exploit its vast wealth of mineral and\r\n  agricultural resources.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $9.2 billion (1992, at 1990 exchange rate)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -6% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $235 (1992, at 1990 exchange rate)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  35-40% per month (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues $NA, expenditures $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\nExports:\r\n  $1.5 billion (f.o.b., 1992 est.)\r\n commodities:\r\n  copper, coffee, diamonds, cobalt, crude oil\r\n partners:\r\n  US, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, UK, Japan, South Africa\r\nImports:\r\n  $1.2 billion (f.o.b., 1992 est.)\r\n commodities:\r\n  consumer goods, foodstuffs, mining and other machinery, transport equipment,\r\n  fuels\r\n partners:\r\n  South Africa, US, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $9.2 billion (May 1992 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth grate NA%\r\nElectricity:\r\n  2,580,000 kW capacity;

Economic difficulties stem from a chronically\r\n  depressed level of copper production and ineffective economic policies. In\r\n  1991 real GDP fell by 2% and in 1992 by 3% more. An annual population growth\r\n  of more than 3% has brought a decline in per capita GDP of 50% over the past\r\n  decade.
