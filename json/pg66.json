He was the father of\r\nGreek, and consequently of European philosophy and science. His\r\nspeculations embraced a wide range of subjects relating to political\r\nas well as to celestial matters. One must remember that even up to\r\nthe 18th century there was no clear distinction between philosophy and\r\nscience, both being products of the human mind in its attempts to\r\nexplain reality.\r\n\r\n    Thales had studied astronomy in Egypt so he was able to draw up\r\naccurate tables forecasting when the River Nile would be in flood.\r\nBut he first became widely known by anticipating an eclipse of the sun\r\nfor May 585 B.C., which happened to coincide with the final battle of\r\nthe war between the Lydians and the Persians. He had used some tables\r\ndrawn up by Babylonian astronomers, but he did not succeed in\r\nforecasting the exact day (May 28th) or the hour of the spectacular\r\nevent.\r\n\r\n    It can well be said that Thales was the first man ever recorded to\r\nhave cornered the market in a commodity: having foreseen a three-year\r\ndrought he bought up large quantities of olive oil and stored it for\r\nsale at a later date.\r\n\r\n    But who could possibly have imagined that one of Thales' original\r\nspeculations would affect the Radio Amateurs of the 20th Century?  He\r\nbelieved that certain inanimate substances, like lodestones (magnetic\r\nrocks) and the resin amber, possessed psyche (a soul).\r\n\r\n     Many centuries had to elapse before this soul was identified as\r\nstatic electricity and magnetism and harnessed for the generation of\r\nmains electricity which dramatically altered the pattern of life on\r\nour planet--and also led to the creation of our hobby of Amateur\r\nRadio.\r\n\r\n     About 400 years ago an English scientist called William Gilbert\r\n(1544-1603), who had read about the unexplained observation of Thales,\r\nalso became interested in the intangible property and decided to call\r\nit electricity, from the classical Greek word for amber, which is\r\nelectron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER ONE\r\n\r\n                 THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRICITY\r\n\r\n    The phenomenon which Thales had observed and recorded five\r\ncenturies before the birth of Christ aroused the interest of many\r\nscientists through the ages. They made various practical experiments\r\nin their efforts to identify the elusive force which Thales had\r\nlikened to a 'soul' and which we now know to have been static\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\n    Of all forms of energy, electricity is the most baffling and\r\ndifficult to describe. An electric current cannot be seen. In fact\r\nit does not exist outside the wires and other conductors which carry\r\nit. A live wire carrying a current looks exactly the same and weighs\r\nexactly the same as it does when it is not carrying a current. An\r\nelectric current is simply a movement or flow of electrons.\r\n\r\n    Benjamin Franklin, the American statesman and scientist born in\r\nBoston in 1706, investigated the nature of thunder and lightning by\r\nflying a child's kite during a thunderstorm. He had attached a metal\r\nspike to the kite, and at the other end of the string to which the\r\nkite was tied he secured a key. As the rain soaked into the string,\r\nelectricity flowed freely down the string and Franklin was able to\r\ndraw large sparks from the key. Of course this could have been very\r\ndangerous, but he had foreseen it and had supported the string through\r\nan insulator. He observed that this electricity had the same\r\nproperties as the static electricity produced by friction.\r\n\r\n    But long before Franklin many other scientists had carried out\r\nresearch into the nature of electricity.\r\n\r\n    In England William Gilbert (1544-1603) had noticed that the powers\r\nof attraction and repulsion of two non-metallic rods which\r\nhe had rubbed briskly were similar to those of lodestone and amber--they\r\nhad acquired the curious quality we call magnetism. Remembering\r\nThales of old he coined the word 'electricity'.\r\n\r\n    Otto von Guericke (1602-1686) a Mayor of Magdeburg in Germany, was\r\nan amateur scientist who had constructed all manner of gadgets. One\r\nof them was a machine consisting of two glass discs revolving in\r\nopposite directions which produced high voltage charges through\r\nfriction. Ramsden and Wimshurst built improved versions of the\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n    A significant breakthrough occurred when Alessandro Volta\r\n(1745-1827) in Italy constructed a simple electric cell (in 1799)\r\nwhich produced a flow of electrons by chemical means. Two plates, one\r\nof copper and the other of zinc, were placed in an acid solution and a\r\ncurrent flowed through an external wire connecting the two plates.\r\nLater he connected cells in series (voltaic pile) which consisted of\r\nalternate layers of zinc and copper discs separated by flannel discs\r\nsoaked in brine or acid which produced a higher electric pressure\r\n(voltage). But Volta never found the right explanation of why his cell\r\nwas working. He thought the flow of electric current was due to the\r\ncontact between the two metals, whereas in fact it results from the\r\nchemical action of the electrolyte on the zinc plate. However, his\r\ndiscovery proved to be of incalculable value in research, as it\r\nenabled scientists to carry out experiments which led to the\r\ndiscoveries of the heating, lighting, chemical and magnetic effects of\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\n    One of the many scientists and physicists who took advantage of\r\nthe 'current electricity' made possible by Volta's cells was Hans\r\nChristian Oersted (1777-1851) of Denmark. Like many others he was\r\nlooking for a connection between the age-old study of magnetism and\r\nelectricity, but now he was able to pass electric currents through\r\nwires and place magnets in various positions near the wires. His\r\nepoch-making discovery which established for the first time the\r\nrelationship between magnetism and electricity was in fact an\r\naccident.\r\n\r\n    While lecturing to students he showed them that the current\r\nflowing in a wire held over a magnetic compass needle and at right\r\nangles to it (that is east-west) had no effect on the needle.  Oersted\r\nsuggested to his assistant that he might try holding the wire parallel\r\nto the length of the needle (north-south) and hey presto, the needle\r\nwas deflected! He had stumbled upon the electromagnetic effect in the\r\nfirst recorded instance of a wire behaving like a magnet when a\r\ncurrent is passed through it.\r\n\r\n   A development of Oersted's demonstration with the compass needle\r\nwas used to construct the world's first system of signaling by the\r\nuse of electricity.\r\n\r\n   In 1837 Charles Wheatstone and William Cooke took out a patent for\r\nthe world's first Five-needle Telegraph, which was installed between\r\nPaddington railway station in west London and West Drayton station a\r\nfew miles away.  The five copper wires required for this system were\r\nembedded in blocks of wood.\r\n\r\n    Electrolysis, the chemical decomposition of a substance into its\r\nconstituent elements by the action of an electric current, was\r\ndiscovered by the English chemists Carlisle and William Nicholson\r\n(1753-1815).  If an electric current is passed through water it is\r\nbroken down into the two elements of which it is composed--hydrogen\r\nand oxygen.  The process is used extensively in modern industry for\r\nelectroplating.  Michael Faraday (1791-1867) who was employed as a\r\nchemist at the Royal Institution, was responsible for introducing many\r\nof the technical terms connected with electrolysis, like electrolyte\r\nfor the liquid through which the electric current is passed, and anode\r\nand cathode for the positive and negative electrodes respectively.  He\r\nalso established the laws of the process itself.  But most people\r\nremember his name in connection with his practical demonstration of\r\nelectromagnetic induction.\r\n\r\n    In France Andre-Marie Ampere (1775-1836) carried out a complete\r\nmathematical study of the laws which govern the interaction between\r\nwires carrying electric currents.\r\n\r\n    In Germany in 1826 a Bavarian schoolmaster Georg Ohm (1789-1854)\r\nhad defined the relationship between electric pressure (voltage),\r\ncurrent (flow rate) and resistance in a circuit (Ohm's law) but 16\r\nyears had to elapse before he received recognition for his work.\r\n\r\n    Scientists were now convinced that since the flow of an electric\r\ncurrent in a wire or a coil of wire caused it to acquire magnetic\r\nproperties, the opposite might also prove to be true: a magnet could\r\npossibly be used to generate a flow of electricity.\r\n\r\n    Michael Faraday had worked on this problem for ten years when\r\nfinally, in 1830, he gave his famous lecture in which he demonstrated,\r\nfor the first time in history, the principle of electromagnetic\r\ninduction.  He had constructed powerful electromagnets consisting of\r\ncoils of wire.  When he caused the magnetic lines of force surrounding\r\none coil to rise and fall by interrupting or varying the flow of\r\ncurrent, a similar current was induced in a neighbouring coil closely\r\ncoupled to the first.\r\n\r\n    The colossal importance of Faraday's discovery was that it paved\r\nthe way for the generation of electricity by mechanical means.\r\nHowever, as can be seen from the drawing, the basic generator produces\r\nan alternating flow of current.(A.C.)\r\n\r\n    Rotating a coil of wire steadily through a complete revolution in\r\nthe steady magnetic field between the north and south poles of a\r\nmagnet results in an electromotive force (E.M.F.)  at its terminals\r\nwhich rises in value, falls back to zero, reverses in a negative\r\ndirection, reaches a peak and again returns to zero.  This completes\r\none cycle or sine wave. (1Hz in S.I.units).\r\n\r\n    In recent years other methods have been developed for generating\r\nelectrical power in relatively small quantities for special\r\napplications.  Semiconductors, which combine heat insulation with good\r\nelectrical conduction, are used for thermoelectric generators to power\r\nisolated weather stations, artificial satellites, undersea cables and\r\nmarker buoys.  Specially developed diode valves are used as thermionic\r\ngenerators with an efficiency, at present, of only 20% but the heat\r\ntaken away from the anode is used to raise steam for conventional\r\npower generation.\r\n\r\n    Sir Humphry Davy (1778-1829) one of Britain's leading chemists of\r\nthe 18th century, is best remembered for his safety lamp for miners\r\nwhich cut down the risk of methane gas explosions in mines.  It was\r\nDavy who first demonstrated that electricity could be used to produce\r\nlight.  He connected two carbon rods to a heavy duty storage battery.\r\nWhen he touched the tips of the rods together a very bright white\r\nlight was produced.  As he drew the rods apart, the arc light\r\npersisted until the tips had burnt away to the critical gap which\r\nextinguished the light.  As a researcher and lecturer at the Royal\r\nInstitution Davy worked closely with Michael Faraday who first joined\r\nthe institution as his manservant and later became his secretary.\r\nDavy's crowning honour in the scientific world came in 1820, when he\r\nwas elected President of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\n    In the U.S.A. the prolific inventor Thomas Alva Edison\r\n(1847-1931) who had invented the incandescent carbon filament bulb,\r\nbuilt a number of electricity generators in the vicinity of the\r\nNiagara Falls.  These used the power of the falling water to drive\r\nhydraulic turbines which were coupled to the dynamos.  These\r\ngenerators were fitted with a spinning switch or commutator (one of\r\nthe neatest gadgets Edison ever invented) to make the current flow in\r\nunidirectional pulses (D.C.)  In 1876 all electrical equipment was\r\npowered by direct current.\r\n\r\n    Today mains electricity plays a vital part in our everyday lives\r\nand its applications are widespread and staggering in their immensity.\r\nBut we must not forget that popular demand for this convenient form of\r\npower arose only about 100 years ago, mainly for illumination.\r\n\r\n    Recent experiments in superconductivity, using ceramic instead\r\nmetal conductors have given us an exciting glimpse into what might be\r\nachieved for improving efficiency in the distribution of electric\r\npower.\r\n\r\n    Historians of the future may well characterise the 20th century as\r\n'the century of electricity & electronics'. But Edison's D.C.\r\ngenerators could not in themselves, have achieved the spectacular\r\nprogress that has been made.  All over the world we depend totally on\r\na system of transmitting mains electricity over long distances which\r\nwas originally created by an amazing inventor whose scientific\r\ndiscoveries changed, and are still changing, the whole world.  His\r\nname was scarcely known to the general public, especially in Europe,\r\nwhere he was born.\r\n\r\n    Who was this unknown pioneer?  Some people reckon that it was this\r\nastonishing visionary who invented wireless, remote control, robotics\r\nand a form of X-ray photography using high frequency radio waves.  A\r\npatent which he took out in the U.S.A. in 1890 ultimately led to the\r\ndesign of the humble ignition coil which energises billions and\r\nbillions of spark plugs in all the motor cars of the world.  His\r\nAmerican patents fill a book two inches thick.  His name was Nicola\r\nTesla (1856-1943).\r\n\r\n    Nicola Tesla was born in a small village in Croatia which at that\r\ntime formed part of the great Austro-Hungarian Empire. Today it is a\r\nnorthern province of Yugoslavia, a state created after the 1914-1918\r\nwar. Tesla studied at the Graz Technical University and later in\r\nBudapest.  Early in his studies he had the idea that a way had to be\r\nfound to run electric motors directly from A.C.  generators.  His\r\nprofessor in Graz had assured him categorically that this was not\r\npossible.  But young Tesla was not convinced.  When he went to\r\nBudapest he got a job in the Central Telegraph Office, and one evening\r\nin 1882, as he was sitting on a bench in the City Park he had an\r\ninspiration which ultimately led to the solution of the problem.\r\n\r\n    Tesla remembered a poem by the German poet Goethe about the sun\r\nwhich supports life on the earth and when the day is over moves on to\r\ngive life to the other side of the globe.  He picked up a twig and\r\nbegan to scratch a drawing on the soil in front of him.  He drew four\r\ncoils arranged symmetrically round the circumference of a circle.  In\r\nthe centre he drew a rotor or armature.  As each coil in turn was\r\nenergised it attracted the rotor towards it and the rotary motion was\r\nestablished.  When he constructed the first practical models he used\r\neight, sixteen and even more coils.  The simple drawing on the ground\r\nled to the design of the first induction motor driven directly by\r\nA.C.electricity.\r\n\r\n    Tesla emigrated to the U.S.A. in 1884. During the first year he\r\nfiled no less than 30 patents mostly in relation to the generation and\r\ndistribution of A.C.  mains electricity.  He designed and built his\r\n'A.C. Polyphase System' which generated three-phase alternating current\r\nat 25 Hz.  One particular unit delivered 422 amperes at 12,000 volts.\r\nThe beauty of this system was that the voltage could be stepped down\r\nusing transformers for local use, or stepped up to many thousands of\r\nvolts for transmission over long distances through relatively thin\r\nconductors.  Edison's generating stations were incapable of any such\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n    Tesla signed a lucrative contract with the famous railway engineer\r\nGeorge Westinghouse, the inventor of the Westinghouse Air Brake which\r\nis used by most railways all over the world to the present day. Their\r\ngenerating station was put into service in 1895 and was called the\r\nNiagara Falls Electricity Generating Company. It supplied power for\r\nthe Westinghouse network of trains and also for an industrial complex\r\nin Buffalo, New York.\r\n\r\n    After ten years Tesla began to experiment with high frequencies.\r\nThe Tesla Coil which he had patented in 1890 was capable of raising\r\nvoltages to unheard of levels such as 300,000 volts.  Edison, who was\r\nstill generating D.C., claimed A.C. was dangerous and to prove it\r\ncontracted with the government to produce the first electric chair\r\nusing A.C. for the execution of murderers condemned to death.  When it\r\nwas first used it was a ghastly flop.  The condemned man moaned and\r\ngroaned and foamed at the mouth.  After four minutes of repeated\r\napplication of the A.C.voltage smoke began to come out of his back.\r\nIt was obvious that the victim had suffered a horribly drawn-out\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n    Tesla said he could prove that A.C. was not dangerous.  He gave a\r\ndemonstration of high voltage electricity flowing harmlessly over his\r\nbody.  But in reality, he cheated, because he had used a frequency of\r\n10,000 cycles (10 kHz) at extremely low current and because of the\r\nskin effect suffered no harm.\r\n\r\n    One of Tesla's patents related to a system of lighting using glass\r\ntubes filled with fluorine (not neon) excited by H.F.voltages. His\r\nworkshop was lit by this method.  Several years before Wilhelm\r\nRoentgen demonstrated his system of X-rays Tesla had been taking\r\nphotographs of the bones in his hand and his foot from up to 40 feet\r\naway using H.F.currents.\r\n\r\n    More astonishing still is the fact that in 1893, two years before\r\nMarconi demonstrated his system of wireless signaling, Tesla had\r\nbuilt a model boat in which he combined power to drive it with radio\r\ncontrol and robotics.  He put the small boat in a lake in Madison\r\nSquare Gardens in New York. Standing on the shore with a control box,\r\nhe invited onlookers to suggest movements.  He was able to make the\r\nboat go forwards and backwards and round in circles.  We all know how\r\nmodel cars and aircraft are controlled by radio today, but when Tesla\r\ndid it a century ago the motor car had not been invented, and the only\r\nmethod by which man could cover long distances was on horseback!\r\n\r\n    Many people believe that a modification of Tesla's 'Magnifying\r\nTransmitter' was used by the Soviet Union when suddenly one day in\r\nOctober 1976 they produced an amazing noise which blotted out all\r\nradio transmissions between 6 and 20 MHz.  (The Woodpecker) The\r\nB.B.C., the N.B.C. and most broadcasting and telecommunication\r\norganisations of the world complained to Moscow (the noise had\r\npersisted continuously for 10 hours on the first day), but all the\r\nRussians would say in reply was that they were carrying out an\r\nexperiment.  At first nobody seemed to know what they were doing\r\nbecause it was obviously not intended as another form of jamming of\r\nforeign broadcasts, an old Russian custom as we all know.\r\n\r\n    It is believed that in the pursuit of his life's ambition to send\r\npower through the earth without the use of wires, Tesla had achieved a\r\nsmall measure of success at E.L.F.  (extremely low frequencies) of the\r\norder of 7 to 12 Hz. These frequencies are at present used by the\r\nmilitary for communicating with submarines submerged in the oceans of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n    Tesla's career and private life have remained something of a\r\nmystery.  He lived alone and shunned public life.  He never read any\r\nof his papers before academic institutions, though he was friendly\r\nwith some journalists who wrote sensational stories about him.  They\r\nsaid he was terrified of microbes and that when he ate out at a\r\nrestaurant he would ask for a number of clean napkins to wipe the\r\ncutlery and the glasses he drank out of.  For the last 20 years of his\r\nlife until he died during World War II in 1943 he lived the life of a\r\nsemi-recluse, with a pigeon as his only companion.  A disastrous fire\r\nhad destroyed his workshops and many of his experimental models and\r\nall his papers were lost for ever.\r\n\r\n    Tesla had moved to Colorado Springs where he built his largest\r\never coil which was 52 feet in diameter.  He studied all the different\r\nforms of lightning in his unsuccessful quest for the transmission of\r\npower without wires.\r\n\r\n    In Yugoslavia, Tesla is a national hero and a well-equipped museum\r\nin Belgrade contains abundant proof of the genius of this\r\nextraordinary man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER TWO\r\n\r\n                THE BIRTH OF RADIO COMMUNICATIONS\r\n\r\n    By 1850 most of the basic electrical phenomena had been\r\ninvestigated.  However, James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879), Professor of\r\nExperimental Physics at Cambridge then came up with something entirely\r\nnew.  By some elegant mathematics he had shown the probable existence\r\nof electromagnetic waves of radiation.  But it was twenty four years\r\nlater (eight years after Maxwell's death) that Heinrich Hertz\r\n(1857-1894) in Germany gave a practical demonstration of the accuracy\r\nof this theory.  He generated and detected electromagnetic waves\r\nacross the length of his laboratory on a wavelength of approximately\r\none metre. His own photograph of the equipment he had set up can be\r\nseen in the Deutsches Museum in Munich.\r\n\r\n    To detect the electromagnetic waves Hertz employed a simple form\r\nof oscillator, which he termed a resonator.  But it was not sensitive\r\nenough to detect waves at any great distance.  Before wireless\r\ntelegraphy could become practicable, a more delicate detector was\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n    Credit is due to Edouard Branly (1844-1940) of France for\r\nproducing the first practical instrument for detecting Hertzian waves,\r\nthe coherer.  It consisted of two metal cylinders with leads attached,\r\nfitted tightly into the interior of a glass tube containing iron or\r\nsteel filings.  The instant an electric discharge of any sort occurred\r\nthe coherer became conductive, and if it was tapped lightly its\r\nconducting property was immediately destroyed.  In practice the\r\ntapping was done automatically by a tapper which came into action the\r\nmoment the coherer became conductive.\r\n\r\n    In Russia the physicist Aleksandr Popov (1859-1905) had used a\r\ncoherer while engaged in the investigation of the effects of lightning\r\ndischarges.  He suggested that such discharges could possibly be used\r\nfor signaling over long distances.  Old timers may remember that\r\nabout 50 years ago Russian amateurs used to send out a QSL card with a\r\ndrawing of Popov and a caption which claimed that he was 'the inventor\r\nof radio'.\r\n\r\n    In Italy, a young 22-year-old electrician became interested in\r\nelectromagnetic radiation after reading papers by Professor Augusto\r\nRighi (1850-1921).  It was Guglielmo Marconi (1874-1937), the son of a\r\nwell-to-do landowner who lived in Bologna, and who was married to\r\nAnnie Jameson of the well known Irish Whiskey family. Guglielmo, their\r\nsecond son, had his early education at a private school in Bedford,\r\nEngland, and later at Livorno and Florence in Italy.  When he read\r\nabout the experiments of Heinrich Hertz and about Popov's suggestion,\r\nhe saw the possibility of using these waves as a means of signaling.\r\nHis first transmitter, shown in the accompanying photograph, did not\r\nradiate very far.  When he folded the metal plate into a cylinder and\r\nplaced it on a pole 30 feet above the induction coil and connected to\r\nit by a vertical wire, he was able to detect the radiation nearly two\r\nkilometres away.  Marconi realised that his signaling system would be\r\nmost useful to shipping, and in those days England possessed the\r\nworld's greatest navy and the world's biggest merchant fleet.\r\n\r\n   The Italian government was not interested in young Marconi's work,\r\nso after a family conference he was brought to London by his mother,\r\nwho had influential relatives there.  Not only did they finance his\r\nearly experiments but they also put him in touch with the right sort\r\nof people.  One of these was Alan A. Campbell Swinton who became the\r\nfirst President of the Radio Society of London (now the R.S.G.B.) many\r\nyears later, in 1913.  Campbell Swinton introduced the young Italian\r\nto William Preece, then Engineer-in-Chief of the British Post Office.\r\nPreece had already been investigating various methods of 'induction'\r\ntelegraphy.\r\n\r\n    In a book entitled Wireless Telegraphy published in 1908, William\r\nJ. White of the Engineer-in-Chief's department at the G.P.O. wrote,\r\n\r\n          \"The  work  of Sir (then Mr)  William  Preece, important\r\n          though  it was,  did not attract the attention  of  the\r\n          public  to  the extent that might have  been  expected.\r\n          This  was  due  to  the  fact that  no  sooner  had  he\r\n          demonstrated a method of wireless telegraphy which  was\r\n          a commercial possibility than his system was superseded\r\n          by another,  and a better one, brought to England by Mr\r\n          Guglielmo  Marconi  in 1896.   The possibilities of  Mr\r\n          Marconi's system were at once recognised by Mr  William\r\n          Preece.   The experience of the elder and the genius of\r\n          the younger man, who must be given the credit of having\r\n          devised   the  first  practical  system  for   wireless\r\n          telegraphy,  combined  to  turn  apparently  disastrous\r\n          failures  into  success,  and now (in  1908),  wireless\r\n          telegraphy has become,  in less than a decade, part and\r\n          parcel of commercial and national life.\"\r\n\r\n    The world's first patent for wireless telegraphy was awarded to\r\nMarconi on the 2nd June 1896. In it he stated that \"electrical action\r\ncan be transmitted through the earth, air or water, by means of\r\noscillations of high frequency.\"  In the first public demonstration of\r\nhis equipment Marconi spanned the 365 metres between the G.P.O.  and\r\nVictoria street.  Later, on Salisbury Plain, in March 1897, his\r\nsignals were detected over 7 kilometres away.  On the 11th & 18th May\r\n1897 messages were first exchanged over water.  On the 27th of March\r\n1899, during naval manoeuvres, Marconi bridged the English Channel for\r\nthe first time, a distance of about 140 kilometres.  His transatlantic\r\ntriumph came on the 12th December 1901 when the morse letter 'S' was\r\ntransmitted from Poldhu, in Cornwall and received by Marconi himself\r\nat St. John's, Newfoundland, who recorded the historic event in his\r\npocket book simply \"Sigs at 12.20, 1.10 & 2.20\".\r\n\r\n    The operation of Marconi's transmitter was itself quite\r\nspectacular.  To produce the oscillations he employed the oscillator\r\ndesigned by Augusto Righi.  Depressing the key closed the circuit and\r\nbrought the inductor coil into action.  Vivid sparks occurred between\r\nthe balls of the oscillator, to the accompaniment of a succession of\r\nsharp cracks, like the reports of a pistol, and some energy was sent\r\noff the square metal plate in the form of trains of electromagnetic\r\nwaves, which radiated out in all directions.  But the energy occupied\r\na very large bandwidth and the receivers of that period could not\r\nseparate two transmissions.  William J. White of the Post Office wrote\r\nin 1908, \"The chief objection which has been raised against modern\r\nwireless telegraphy is its want of secrecy.  With a transmitter\r\nsending out waves in all directions, it is possible for unscrupulous\r\npersons to receive the messages and make an improper use of them.\r\nThis form of 'scientific hooliganism' has, in fact, become somewhat\r\nnotorious.  When two or three transmitters are each sending out their\r\nelectromagnetic waves, the result, naturally, is utter confusion.\"\r\nWhite added that the British Postal Administration was refusing to\r\ngrant licences for more than one system in the same area, in spite of\r\nthe fact that there had been some 'alleged' solutions of the problem.\r\nThe phenomenon of resonance was known and Dr (later Sir Oliver) Lodge\r\nhad taken out various patents between 1889 and 1898 in connection with\r\nreceivers.  Marconi and his assistants ultimately solved the problem\r\nby modifying Lodge's syntonic Leyden jar tuned circuit.  They added a\r\ntapped inductance in the aerial circuit of the transmitter and used\r\nvariable capacitors instead of fixed ones.  This was probably the most\r\nsignificant modification made in the development of wireless\r\ntelegraphy.  (In Greek the word syntonismos 'to bring to equal tone'\r\nis used for 'tuning'.)\r\n\r\n   Apart from the patents taken out by Sir Oliver Lodge and Dr\r\nAlexander Muirhead, in 1897, patents were taken out in Germany by\r\nProfessor Braun of Strasbourg, who was joined by Professor Slaby and\r\nCount D'Arco in 1903 to form the Telefunken company, and in the U.S.A.\r\nby Dr Lee De Forest of the American De Forest Wireless Telegraph\r\nCompany who was the first to use a high A.C.  voltage of 20,000 volts\r\nto obtain the necessary high-potential discharges, thus dispensing\r\nwith the induction coil.  Again in the U.S.A., Professor R.O.Fessenden\r\nwas responsible for the design of new types of transmitting and\r\nreceiving apparatus.\r\n\r\n   During this period Marconi had resisted all offers by financiers to\r\nacquire his patents.  In July 1897 he entrusted his cousin Jameson\r\nDavis to form The Wireless Telegraph & Signal Company Ltd which soon\r\nbecame Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Co., and ultimately the Marconi\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\n    William Preece of the Post Office detached one of his assistants,\r\nGeorge S.  Kemp, to help Marconi.  Kemp was destined to become his\r\nright-hand man and served Marconi faithfully throughout his life. By\r\ntoday's standards, Marconi can be said to have been a highly\r\nsuccessful entrepreneur.  He had the great knack of selecting the\r\nright man for the job, and inspired deep loyalty in his staff.  He\r\nregarded himself as an 'amateur' and often paid tribute to the work of\r\nradio experimenters.\r\n\r\n            (Most of the above passages are quoted from 'A History of\r\nthe Marconi Company' by W.J.Baker, published by Methuen & Co Ltd.\r\nreprinted in 1979.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER THREE\r\n\r\n                    THE RADIO AMATEUR MOVEMENT\r\n\r\n      From the turn of the century enthusiastic young men who built\r\ntheir own items of electrical and wireless apparatus were known as\r\n\"Wireless Experimenters\".  Many of them were later granted licences\r\nfor the use of \"Wireless Telegraphy for experimental purposes\" (in the\r\nUnited Kingdom) by the Postmaster General under the terms of the 1904\r\nWireless Telegraphy Act.  In his report to Parliament for the years\r\n1905-1906 the P.M.G.  stated that it was his wish \"to promote\r\nexperimental investigations in this promising field\".\r\n\r\n    In a book published in 1908 by R.P.Howgrave-Graham entitled\r\n\"Wireless Telegraphy for Amateurs\" the word amateur seems to have been\r\nused for the first time.\r\n\r\n    During the 1914-1918 war all wireless apparatus in the possession\r\nof licensed amateurs was closed down under the Defence of the Realm\r\nAct of 1914.  Experimental transmission licences numbered 1,600.\r\n\r\n    After the end of the war an Inter-Departmental Committee was set\r\nup and in its report to the Postmaster General dated April 1919 it\r\nstated: \"We are of the opinion that the number of stations existing in\r\nJuly 1914 was excessive from the point of view of government control\r\nin case of emergency and the necessity of preventing interference with\r\ngovernment and commercial working; further there was no justification\r\nfor it from the point of view of the encouragement of research or\r\ndevelopment of industry\".\r\n\r\n    But there was a magnanimous relaxation in the Defence Regulations\r\nwhen the Post Office notified manufacturers of electrical apparatus\r\nthat restriction on the sale of buzzers had been removed. Buzzers\r\ncould now be sold without enquiry as to the use to which the purchaser\r\nproposed to put them!!!\r\n\r\n    During 1919 many issues of WIRELESS WORLD considered \"the amateur\r\nposition\", and a leading article in the March issue began with a\r\nquotation attributed to Marconi:\r\n\r\n          \"I consider that the existence of a body of independent\r\n      and  often  enthusiastic  amateurs constitutes  a  valuable\r\n      asset   towards   the  further  development   of   wireless\r\n      telegraphy.\"\r\n\r\n    In a subsequent letter to the Editor Marconi wrote:\r\n\r\n          \"In  my  opinion  it  would be  a  mistaken  policy  to\r\n      introduce  legislation  to prevent  amateurs  experimenting\r\n      with  wireless  telegraphy  (which  the  authorities   were\r\n      contemplating).  Had  it  not been for  amateurs,  wireless\r\n      telegraphy as a great world-fact might not have existed  at\r\n      all.  A  great  deal  of the development  and  progress  of\r\n      wireless telegraphy is due to the efforts of amateurs.\"\r\n\r\n    John Ambrose Fleming, the inventor of the diode valve, also wrote\r\nto the Editor of W.W. as follows:\r\n\r\n          \"It  is a matter of common knowledge that a large  part\r\n      of  the  important inventions in connection  with  wireless\r\n      telegraphy  have  been  the work of  amateurs  and  private\r\n      research  and  not  the outcome of official brains  or  the\r\n      handiwork  of military or naval organisations.  In fact  we\r\n      may  say that wireless telegraphy itself in  its  inception\r\n      was an amateur product.  Numerous important inventions such\r\n      as the crystal detector,  the oscillating valve, the triode\r\n      valve--have been due to private or amateur work.  If full\r\n      opportunities  for such non-official research work are  not\r\n      restored,  the  progress of the art of radio telegraphy and\r\n      radio telephony will be greatly hindered.\"\r\n\r\n    Professor W.H. Eccles wrote:\r\n\r\n          \"Improvements  and invention must be stimulated to  the\r\n      utmost.  It  is  not impossible to devise  laws  to  impose\r\n      restrictions  upon  the emission of wireless waves as  will\r\n      preclude interference with the public radio service of  the\r\n      future   (R.F.I.   &  T.V.I.?!!)  and  yet  allow   liberal\r\n      opportunities   for  the  experimental  study  of  wireless\r\n      telegraphy.\"\r\n\r\n    NOTE.  The above passages are taken from WORLD AT THEIR FINGERTIPS\r\nby John Clarricoats, O.B.E., G6CL, published by the R.S.G.B. in 1968.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER FOUR\r\n\r\n                  THE 1921 TRANSATLANTIC TESTS\r\n\r\n    Most commercial experimental transmissions in wireless telegraphy\r\nbefore World War I were carried out on the \"long\" wavelengths, though\r\nthey were not called that at the time.  Transmissions by amateurs in\r\nthe United Kingdom and the U.S.A. on the other hand were made around\r\n200 metres (1.5MHz).  In the U.S.A. amateurs were permitted to use a\r\nD.C.input of 1,000 watts to the anode of the final stage of their\r\ntransmitters.  In the U.K.  the maximum power allowed was 10 watts and\r\nthe combined height and length of the transmitting aerial was not to\r\nexceed 100 feet. So when the first attempt to span the Atlantic was\r\nmade in February of 1921 it was natural that the American stations\r\nshould do the transmitting and the Europeans the listening.\r\n\r\n    About 25 U.S. amateur stations participated in the tests, which\r\ntook place early in the morning on the 2nd, 4th and 6th of February\r\n1921. Although about 200 European stations had indicated their\r\nintention to listen only 30 actually submitted logs.  And not a single\r\none of them was able to report hearing anything that could be\r\nattributed to the American transmissions.\r\n\r\n    The then Editor of QST wrote: \"We have tested most of the circuits\r\nused by the Britishers and find them one and all decidedly inferior to\r\nour standard American regenerative circuit using variometer tuning in\r\nsecondary and tertiary circuits.  We would bet our new Spring hat that\r\nif a good U.S. amateur with such a set and an Armstrong\r\nsuperheterodyne could be sent to England, reception of the U.S.\r\ntransmissions would straightaway become commonplace.\" Strong language.\r\n\r\n    In September of the same year it was announced that a prominent\r\nU.S. amateur Paul Godley 2ZE would be going to Europe to take part in\r\nthe second series of tests planned for December. His expenses were\r\nbeing paid by the A.R.R.L.  which already boasted having 15,000\r\ntransmitting members.  In the U.S.A.  distances of over 2,000 miles\r\nhad already been achieved.\r\n\r\n    During his brief stay of a few hours in London Paul Godley was\r\nintroduced to Senator Marconi, to Admiral of the Fleet Sir Henry\r\nJackson, to Alan A. Campbell Swinton and many other distinguished\r\nmembers of the Wireless Society of London, as the R.S.G.B. was then\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\n    Paul Godley first set up his receiving equipment at Wembley Park,\r\nMiddlesex but soon decided that the electrical noises in the area\r\nwould not permit reception of the weak transatlantic signals.  He\r\ntherefore obtained permission to set up the European receiving station\r\nat Ardrossan a coast town near Glasgow, Scotland.  The actual site was\r\na large field heavily covered with seaweed.  He was assisted in the\r\nerection of his receiving antenna by a member of the Marconi\r\nInternational Marine Communications Company.  1,300 feet of\r\nphosphor-bronze wire was stretched 12 feet above the ground on ten\r\npoles spaced equally along the full length of the wire which was\r\nearthed at the far end through a non-inductive resistor. This was the\r\nfirst Beverage type receiving array ever erected in the United\r\nKingdom.  Before the actual tests took place the length of the wire\r\nwas reduced to 850 feet.\r\n\r\n    At 00.50 GMT on December 9th 1921 Godley identified signals from\r\n1BCG located at Greenwich, Connecticut. The station there was manned by\r\nsix members of the Radio Club of America.  One of the operators was\r\nE. Howard Armstrong inventor of the regenerative detector,\r\nsuper-regeneration and the supersonic heterodyne receiver, though the\r\nFrench claim that the superhet was first designed by Lucien Levy of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n    Two days later the historic first complete message transmitted by\r\nU.S. amateurs and received in Europe on the \"short waves\" (actually 230\r\nmetres) heralded a new era.  The message read:\r\n\r\n          No.1 de 1BCG.  WORDS 12.  NEW YORK DECEMBER 11 1921. TO\r\n          PAUL GODLEY ARDROSSAN SCOTLAND.  HEARTY\r\n          CONGRATULATIONS. SIGNED BURGHARD INMAN GRINAN ARMSTRONG\r\n          AMY CRONKHITE.\r\n\r\n    Eight British amateurs had also copied the message correctly.  One\r\nof them was W.E. \"Bill\" Corsham 2UV of Willesden, London who was later\r\ncredited by the R.S.G.B.  and the A.R.R.L.  as being the inventor of\r\nthe QSL card.  Bill had used a simple three valve receiver and an\r\ninverted-L wire 100 feet long compared to Godley's huge Beverage\r\narray.\r\n\r\n    In the summer of 1922 amateurs in France began to get licences and\r\nLeon Deloy 8AB President of the Radio Club of Nice in southern France\r\nstarted hearing British stations.  After a visit to the U.S.A.  Deloy\r\nwas able to improve his equipment and on November 27th 1923 he\r\ncontacted Fred Schnell 1MO of West Hartford, Connecticut for the first\r\never 2-way QSO across the Atlantic. They used the \"useless\"\r\nwavelengths around 100 metres.\r\n\r\n    INTERNATIONAL DX had come to stay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER FIVE\r\n\r\n                 THE FIRST GREEK RADIO AMATEURS\r\n\r\n    As no licences were issued for many years there are no official\r\nrecords to be consulted.  Early activity was mainly in and around\r\nAthens but there may have been one or two stations in other parts of\r\nthe country which we never heard in the capital.  At the time of\r\nwriting (1987) four of the original pioneers in the Athens area are\r\nalive and three of them are currently active on the H.F. bands.\r\n\r\n     Athanassis 'Takis' Coumbias has QSL cards addressed to him dated\r\n1929 when he was a short wave listener in Odessa, Russia with the SWL\r\ncallsign RK-1136. In 1931 his family, like many other Greek families\r\nin Russia, moved to Athens where Takis built a 4-valve transmitter\r\nwith which he was very active on 40 and 20 metre CW using the callsign\r\nSV1AAA.\r\n\r\n    I frequently operated his station myself and when I asked him why\r\nhe had chosen that particular callsign he gave me what proved to be a\r\ntruly prophetic answer. \"It will be ages,\" he said, \"before the Greek\r\nState officially recognizes the very existence of radio amateurs and\r\nbegins to issue transmitting licences to them.  After that it might\r\ntake another 50 years for them to get to the three-letter series\r\nbeginning with SV1AAA.\"\r\n\r\n    In actual fact this is what happened: legislation was enacted 40\r\nyears later and the callsign SV1AAA was officially allocated to Nikita\r\nVenizelos after 54 years had elapsed!\r\n\r\n    Although at the time there was no official recognition of amateur\r\nradio in Greece, the existence and identity of the handful of 'under\r\ncover' operators was known to the Head of the W/T section at the\r\nMinistry of Posts & Telegraphs (Greek initials T.T.T.)  Stefanos\r\nEleftheriou who did more than anyone else to encourage and promote the\r\ndevelopment of our hobby.  In fact, following a minor brush with the\r\npolice in 1937 (described by N2DOE later in this book) Eleftheriou\r\nissued three licences 'for experimental research in connection with\r\nthe propagation of short waves' on the basis of earlier legislation\r\ngoverning the use of wireless telegraphy which really had nothing to\r\ndo with amateur radio.  The recipients of these three licences were\r\nCostas 'Bill' Tavaniotis SV1KE, Aghis Cazazis SV1CA and Nikos Katselis\r\nSV1NK.  As there were no relevant regulations the choice of callsign\r\nwas left to the individual operators.  For instance, Tavaniotis ran\r\nhis own electrical and electronic business called KONSTAV ELECTRIC so\r\nhe decided to use \"KE\" as his callsign.\r\n\r\n    As far as I know the following ten amateurs were active in the\r\nAthens area in 1937:\r\n\r\n          1. Takis Coumbias.....................SV1AAA\r\n          2. 'Bill' Tavaniotis..................SV1KE (silent key)\r\n          3. Polycarpos  Psomiadis..............SV1AZ (now N2DOE)\r\n          4. Aghis Cazazis......................SV1CA (silent key)\r\n          5. Nikos Katselis.....................SV1NK (silent key)\r\n          6. George Zarifis...............SV1SP/SV6SP (now SV1AA)\r\n          7. Nasos Coucoulis....................SV1SM (silent key)\r\n          8. George Yiapapas....................SV1GY (now QRT)\r\n          9. Menelaos Paidousis.................SV1MP\r\n         10. Norman Joly........................SV1RX (now G3FNJ)\r\n\r\n\r\n    In 1952 Costas Karayiannis who ran a big business called RADIO\r\nKARAYIANNI published an amazingly comprehensive book entitled ELLINIKI\r\nRADIOFONIA which means 'Greek Broadcasting'. It contained a vast\r\ntreasure of information on many subjects allied to broadcasting, and\r\nthere was a page entitled DAWN (1930-1940) which dealt with amateur\r\nradio activity in Greece before World War II.  It confirmed most of\r\nthe names listed above as can be seen in the photo-copy of the\r\noriginal Greek text, and it mentioned three others: George Gerardos\r\nSV1AG, (silent key), S. Stefanou and Mikes Psalidas who was allocated\r\nthe callsign SV1AF 20 years later, though he, like many others had\r\ncome on the air after the end of the war with an unofficial callsign.\r\n\r\n    Were all these operators who functioned strictly in accordance\r\nwith international regulations pirates?  In my view they were\r\ncertainly not pirates.  If the State was officially unaware of the\r\nexistence of amateur radio how could they apply for licences and be\r\nissued with official callsigns?\r\n\r\n    Later in this book N2DOE describes how a handful of amateurs had\r\nprepared draft legislation in 1937 at the request of Stefanos\r\nEleftheriou of the Ministry but the outbreak of World War II in\r\nSeptember 1939 had prevented him from taking any action in this\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\n    The island of Crete in southern Greece was first heard on the air\r\nin 1938 when George Zarifis came on 40 metre CW using the callsign\r\nSV6SP.  His transmitter consisted of a single metal 6L6 crystal\r\noscillator with an input of about 7 watts.  For reception he used an\r\nAmerican CASE broadcast receiver in which he had fitted a BFO. In a\r\nvery short period he had about 500 QSOs.\r\n\r\n    Forty four years later some of the younger generation of operators\r\nwho had not heard of this early activity from Crete allocated the\r\nprefix SV9 to the island.  Rather illogically they allocated SV8 to\r\nall the other islands irrespective of their geographical position and\r\nwith yet another exception--SV5 for the twelve Dodecanese islands.\r\n\r\n    General George Zarifis (retired) SV1AA as he is now, had started\r\nplaying with 'wireless' a long long time before he went to Crete.  In\r\n1921 when he was in the 4th form at school he had bought two kits of\r\nparts from France and put them together with the help of his\r\nfellow-student George Grabinger.  The kit consisted of a bright\r\nemitter triode in an oscillating circuit.  The heater supply was a 4\r\nvolt accumulator, and a dozen or so dry cells, with an earphone in\r\nseries, supplied the anode voltage.  The tuned circuit consisted of a\r\ncoil with a small pressure operated capacitor across it. A carbon\r\nmicrophone with a dry cell in series was connected to two or three\r\nturns of wire wound over the coil.  The assembled kits were tested\r\nclose to each other and they worked.  Later, when they had connected\r\nrandom length wire antennas to the circuits the two schoolboys were\r\nable to talk to each other across the 400 metres which separated their\r\nhomes.  These contacts quite definitely heralded the dawn of amateur\r\nradio in Greece at about the same time as the 1921 Transatlantic tests\r\nwere taking place.\r\n\r\n    On the 1st of September 1939 Hitler's armies invaded Poland.\r\nGreat Britain which had a treaty with Poland was compelled to declare\r\nwar on Germany two days later on the 3rd, followed by France.  Canada\r\nand Australia declared war on Germany the next day.  All the radio\r\namateurs in Athens immediately dismantled their transmitters and\r\ndispersed the components.\r\n\r\n    So ended the first phase of amateur radio activity in Greece.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER SIX\r\n\r\n                 WORLD WAR II AND AFTER IN GREECE\r\n\r\n    Socrates Coutroubis SV1AE described to me how his interest in\r\nradio was aroused in 1935 when he was 13 years old. His father had\r\ndecided to buy a domestic radio receiver.\r\n\r\n    \"Of course in 1935 Athens had no broadcasting service,\" Socrates\r\nsaid, \"so the receiver had to be able to tune in to the short wave\r\nbroadcasting bands.  As we already had a Westinghouse refrigerator my\r\nfather decided we should try one of their receivers.  When I say 'try'\r\nI must explain that it was the usual thing to ask a number of agents\r\nto submit their latest models for comparison at one's home.  I\r\nremember that together with the Westinghouse, we had an Atwater Kent,\r\nPhilco, RCA, Stromberg-Carlson and several sets of European\r\nmanufacture such as Philips, Blaupunkt, Saba etc.  We finally settled\r\nfor the German Saba because it was the prettiest and blended better\r\nwith our living room furniture!\r\n\r\n    \"There were very few stations to be found on the short waves.  But\r\nI remember the Dutch station PCJ run by the Philips company in\r\nEindhoven.  The announcer was Edward Startz who spoke perfect English\r\nand about a dozen other languages.  \"This is the Happy Station,\r\nbroadcasting from the Netherlands\" he would say cheerfully.\r\n\r\n    \"A couple of years after we had bought the radio we were returning\r\nfrom an open air movie round about midnight when I noticed a book on\r\nsale at a road-side kiosk. It was entitled THE RADIO AMATEUR'S\r\nHANDBOOK published by the A.R.R.L. I had no idea what the initials\r\nstood for.  The price was astronomical for my pocket but after a\r\nlittle coercion I got my father to buy it for me.  When I began to\r\nread it I discovered the existence of radio amateurs.  It was the 1939\r\nedition and I found a circuit for a receiver which looked simple\r\nenough for me to try.  It was described as a regenerative detector and\r\naudio amplifier.\r\n\r\n    \"At that time the best place to buy components in Athens was at a\r\nstore called Radio Karayianni, but three others shops also stocked\r\nvalves (tubes) and components.  One was the Electron run by George\r\nSpanos, who was the agent for the Dutch Philips company. Then there\r\nwas a shop in a basement next door, Konstav Electric, owned by 'Bill'\r\nTavaniotis SV1KE.  A wide range of components were also stocked by the\r\nRaytheon agent, Nick Katselis SV1NK.\r\n\r\n    \"I obtained some plug-in forms and wound the coils carefully\r\naccording to the instructions but unfortunately the receiver didn't\r\nwork very well, if at all. When I asked a few friends they suggested I\r\nshould shorten the very long wires I had used between the components,\r\nand sure enough I had the greatest thrill of my life when for the\r\nfirst time I heard Rome on short waves on my very own home-made\r\nreceiver.  Outstanding stations in the broadcast band in those days\r\nwere Trieste in northern Italy, Katowice in Poland, Breslau in Germany\r\nand Toulouse in south-west France.\r\n\r\n    \"Although I had read about the activities of radio amateurs in the\r\nHandbook I had not yet heard any of the half dozen or so stations that\r\nwere already operating on CW and AM telephony in the Athens area.\r\n\r\n    \"My father used to buy the periodical LONDON CALLING which\r\ncontained the overseas programmes of the B.B.C. as well as the\r\nprogrammes of the principal European broadcasting stations.  This\r\npublication also carried advertisements and it was there that I first\r\nsaw an illustration of the Hammarlund Super Pro and realised that\r\nthere were receivers specially designed for the reception of short\r\nwaves.\r\n\r\n    \"But during the German/Italian occupation of Greece between 1941\r\nand 1944 my little home-made receiver played a vital role in enabling\r\nus to listen (secretly) to the B.B.C. broadcasts because the\r\nauthorities had sealed all radios to the broadcast (medium wave) band\r\nand to the frequency of Radio Athens.  Most people devised ingenuous\r\nmethods of listening to stations other than Athens.\r\n\r\n    \"After the end of the war a friend of mine who returned to Athens\r\nfrom Cairo brought me the 1945 edition of the A.R.R.L.Handbook, which\r\nis still on the shelf as you can see.\"\r\n\r\n    Socrates explained that in 1945 there was complete political\r\nupheaval in Greece, owing to the events that had taken place during\r\nthe foreign occupation, so the General Election of that year was\r\ncarried out under the supervision of foreign observers from the\r\nU.S.A., the United Kingdom & France. The Russians did not send a\r\nmission.\r\n\r\n    \"Owing to my knowledge of English I was employed by the American\r\nmission to act as interpreter.  One day when I was off duty I was\r\ntaken by a friend to a signals unit where there were many pieces of\r\nequipment which had been 'liberated', and I was able to buy a BC 342\r\nreceiver.  Later when Harry Barnett SV1WE who was in the Press\r\nDepartment of the British Embassy returned to England I bought his\r\nHallicrafter SX28.\r\n\r\n    \"It was at Harry's house in Kolonaki that I had my first taste of\r\namateur radio in action.  He had a National HRO for reception and he\r\nhad constructed a 50-watt transmitter using surplus components which\r\nwere in plentiful supply at that time.\r\n\r\n    \"Another friend of mine, Jim Liverios, was employed at the Civil\r\nAviation transmitter site on a hill south of Nea Smyrni.  The American\r\nMission had set up their short wave transmitters on the same site and\r\nlater Interpol installed their own equipment as well.  Liverios was\r\nalways on night shift because he attended the University during the\r\nday. I still don't know how he ever managed to get any sleep. When\r\nthings were quiet he would 'borrow' a 5 Kw transmitter and tune it in\r\nthe 20 metre band. Using a callsign of his own choice (probably a\r\ndifferent one every night) he would have contacts with the whole\r\nworld.  On his invitation I went there at midnight one night and\r\nstayed until the morning.  I remember we had QSOs with Cuba, Chile,\r\nNew Zealand and Australia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n              THE AFFAIR OF THE PIRAEUS POLICE.\r\n\r\n    In 1947, there was a war in northern Greece which some people\r\ncalled a civil war and others a war against the guerrillas, depending\r\non whose side they were on.  Suddenly one morning all the Athens\r\nnewspapers came out with some amazing headlines:\r\n\r\n\"THE WIRELESS TRANSMITTERS OF THE COMMUNISTS HAVE BEEN SEIZED IN\r\nATHENS\"\r\n\r\n\"WIRELESS TRANSMITTERS FOUND IN COMMUNIST HANDS\"\r\n\r\n\"HOW THE FIVE TRANSMITTERS OF THE COMMUNISTS WERE DISCOVERED\"\r\n\r\n\"THE SIX INSTALLATIONS SEIZED BY THE POLICE\"\r\n\r\n    Two of the newspapers printed the identical photograph (included\r\nin the montage) with the following caption, 'The Communist\r\ntransmitters seized by the Piraeus police'.  This was a photograph of\r\nthe shack of Mikes Psalidas SV1AF. At the top right one can see a\r\n2-inch home-made monitor oscilloscope, which the newspapers described\r\nas a 'powerful radar'!\r\n\r\n    \"During the last three days,\" wrote one newspaper, \"the police in\r\nPiraeus have been investigating a very serious case implicating\r\nleading cadres of the Communist party.\"  Of course, it was nothing of\r\nthe sort.  The equipment they had seized belonged to five radio\r\namateurs, George Gerardos SV1AG, Mikes Psalidas SV1AF, Nasos Coucoulis\r\nSV1AC, Aghis Cazazis SV1CA and Sotiris Stefanou who didn't have a\r\ncallsign yet.  In fact Mikes Psalidas was not even at home at the time\r\nof the police raid, as he was in a military camp in the outskirts of\r\nAthens, doing his compulsory military service.  The newspapers\r\ndescribed in detail what had been found.  \"At the house of Mikes\r\nPsalidas, who is a student at the Athens Polytechnic, the police found\r\nwireless telegraphy receiving equipment (a National HRO), wireless\r\ntelephony equipment in full working order, that is, two transmitting\r\nmicrophones, a step-down transformer and various other items.\"\r\n\r\n    The same newspaper went on \"Unfortunately, at the house of Aghis\r\nCazazis, at 25 Tenedou street, the search was inconclusive because a\r\ncertain person, well known to the police, and whose arrest is\r\nimminent, removed a high power transmitter just before the police\r\narrived and disappeared with it.\"\r\n\r\n    Another newspaper referred to \"telegrams in code\", received from\r\nabroad and from the secret headquarters of the Communists, \"which are\r\nnow being deciphered by a special department\".  These were SV1AG's\r\nlittle collection of QSL cards.\r\n\r\n    Stefanos Eleftheriou of the Ministry immediately took up the\r\nmatter. Firstly, he pointed out to the Piraeus police that Athens did\r\nnot come under their jurisdiction, and they had no right to arrest\r\nanybody there without a warrant.  Secondly, all the five radio\r\namateurs they had arrested were known for their nationalistic\r\npolitical convictions, particularly Psalidas whose father was a senior\r\nofficer of the Royal Hellenic airforce.\r\n\r\n    Before the 'suspects' were released and their confiscated\r\nequipment returned to them, they were warned not to speak to newspaper\r\nreporters at the risk of getting a kick up their backsides.  This was\r\nto prevent the public from learning how ludicrous had been the\r\naccusations, and how completely unjustified the arrests had been.  But\r\none newspaper came out the following day with a banner headline \"THE\r\nOWNERS OF THE WIRELESS AND RADAR EQUIPMENT ALL TURNED OUT TO BE\r\nSTAUNCH ROYALISTS!\" This paper sent a reporter to interview SV1AC.\r\nThey wrote, \"In reply to a question from our reporter, Mr Coucoulis\r\nsaid that when the police realised the foolishness of their action,\r\nthey issued a summons against him under Law 4749, which has absolutely\r\nnothing to do with amateur radio.\"\r\n\r\n    \"During the ten years following the end of World War II there were\r\nabout 15 to 20 very active amateurs in the Athens area, all using\r\ncallsigns of their own choice because no government legislation had\r\nyet been enacted.  Most of these operators subsequently obtained\r\nlicences and had to change to the official series.  I remember two YLs\r\nwho were very popular in Europe and the U.S.A.  because they spoke\r\nseveral languages fluently, but they never re-appeared when licences\r\nbegan to be issued.\"\r\n\r\n   Since 1945 the U.S. and British signals units were authorised by\r\nthe Greek Ministry of Communications to issue calls to military and\r\ndiplomatic personnel in the series SV0WA in the case of American staff\r\nand SV0AA for the British.\r\n\r\n    Socrates continued: \"I heard that the Americans had formed a club\r\ncalled 'Attica Amateur Radio Club' in Kifissia, a suburb to the north\r\nof Athens, and in due course I was able to become a member.\"\r\n\r\n    \"In 1954,\" Socrates continued, \"George Zarifis (currently SV1AA)\r\nwho was a regular army officer in the Legal Branch approached Mr\r\nNicolis who was Director of the Wireless Division at the Ministry of\r\nCommunications and asked him 'Since you have authorised the Americans\r\nand the British to issue licences to their personnel, why do you not\r\ngrant the same facility to us Greek amateurs?'.  To which Nicolis had\r\nreplied 'There is no law of the land recognising the very existence of\r\nradio amateurs so how can I issue licences to you?'.\r\n\r\n    \"It was then that we decided to form an association whose\r\nprincipal objective would be the enactment of legislation recognising\r\nofficially the existence of radio amateurs in Greece.  As a recognised\r\nbody we would then be able to go back to Nicolis and get him to pursue\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n    \"That was how, late in 1957, we formed the Radio Amateur\r\nAssociation of Greece, R.A.A.G., Greek initials E.E.R.\r\n\r\n    \"At the same time, after considerable effort, we got the Ministry\r\nto issue 7 licences based on the Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1930 (No\r\n4797) and the regulations relating to Law 1049 of 1949, as well as a\r\ndocument dated July 8th 1957 issued by the radio division of the\r\nCentral Intelligence service (Greek initials K.Y.P.-R).  This order\r\nauthorised the installation of a 50 watt transmitter to an applicant\r\nunder certain strict limitations, one of which was that the station\r\ncould only be operated from 06.00 to 08.00 hours and from 13.00 to\r\nmidnight.  The seven lucky recipients are shown in the accompanying\r\nphotograph.\r\n\r\n        Akis Lianos SV1AD, Socrates Coutroubis SV1AE, Nasos Coucoulis\r\nSV1AC (silent key), George Zarifis SV1AA, Mikes Psalidas SV1AF, George\r\nVernardakis SV1AB and George Gerardos SV1AG (silent key).\r\n\r\n  \"At that time (1958) my AM station consisted of a Hammarlund SP600\r\nreceiver and a home-built transmitter using an Italian Geloso\r\nVFO-exciter driving a pair of 6146s in the final, with anode and\r\nscreen modulation by a pair of 807s in class AB2. I had also assembled\r\na double conversion receiver using a Geloso front end.  This was\r\ntypical of the equipment used in Greece and Italy in the early 1960s.\r\n\r\n    \"Licences continued to be issued until 1967 when the Junta\r\nColonels Papadopoulos and Patakos established the military\r\ndictatorship.  We were all ordered to seal our equipment and obtain\r\nwritten confirmation from the nearest Police authority that the\r\ndisablement had been carried out.\r\n\r\n    \"Six months later, in December of 1967 we started getting our\r\nlicences back.  Most of us believed that because some of the younger\r\nofficers in the military government had received training at the\r\nPentagon in the U.S.A. they convinced their superiors that it was\r\nbetter for the genuine amateurs to be allowed to operate their\r\nequipment under close supervision by the military and under new\r\nregulations, rather than have under cover operators starting up all\r\nover again.\r\n\r\n    \"George Gerardos SV1AG had a friend Oresti Yiaka who was involved\r\nin government telecommunications and it was through him that draft\r\nlegislation for the issue of amateur licences was instigated, but not\r\nfor the first time. Unsuccessful attempts had been made before the war.\r\n\r\n    \"In 1965 when George Papandreou was Prime Minister, on the very\r\nday when the Draft Bill was going to be put before Parliament the\r\ngovernment resigned and another 10 years went by.  When legislation\r\nwas finally published in the Government Gazette in 1972, owing to the\r\nprevailing political situation (military dictatorship) it had serious\r\nlimitations imposed by some Ministries which had to look after their\r\nown interests, especially the Ministry of National Defence. But George\r\nGerardos, SV1AG, who had been closely involved, decided that it would\r\nbe better to overlook certain details which may seem strange to us at\r\nthe present time--details which could be rectified at a later date,\r\nprovided the law was finally on the Statute book.  For instance, I\r\nrefer to the very restricted frequencies we were allocated in the\r\n80-metre band, 3.500 to 3.600 MHz. Obviously when we began\r\ntransmitting SSB telephony below 3.600 we were greeted with angry\r\nprotestations from the CW operators there.  And what was worse, the\r\nvoices of Greek amateurs were not heard in the DX portion of the phone\r\nallocation from 3.750 to 3.800 MHz.\r\n\r\n    \"Unfortunately, there was another and more serious snag. The last\r\nparagraph of the Law said that it would come into force only after\r\npublication in the Government Gazette of regulations clarifying\r\ncertain details and procedures.  So we were back to square one.\r\n\r\n    \"But this did not prevent the General Staff of the military\r\ndictatorship from continuing to issue new licences under the special\r\nrestrictions they had laid down.  When the dictatorship came to an end\r\nthe new government finally published Regulation 271 on April 30th\r\n1976, which made the 1972 law fully operative.\"\r\n\r\n    During the period of the military dictatorship a break-away club\r\nwas formed by Dinos Psiloyiannis SV1DB who added the word 'national'\r\nto its name making the Greek initials E.E.E.R.  His motives were\r\nrather dubious, one of them being that he objected to a regulation\r\nwhich required an applicant for a licence to produce a declaration\r\nsigned by the President and the Secretary of Radio Amateur Association\r\nof Greece.  Psiloyiannis, who had contacts with the military\r\nauthorities (both his father and brother were officers) declared \"I\r\nwill form my own association and issue declarations myself.\"  By this\r\nmanoeuvre he obtained licences for quite a few newcomers, but after a\r\nyear or two his club ceased to function and most if not all of its\r\nmembers joined the R.A.A.G.\r\n\r\n    An amendment of Law 1244 of 1972 published in the Government\r\nGazette No.114 dated June 3rd 1988 finally abolished the requirement\r\nof the controversial declaration, as well as the rule which said that\r\nbefore anyone could apply for a licence they had to join an officially\r\nrecognised association or club.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER SEVEN\r\n\r\n                        PIONEERS IN GREECE\r\n\r\n1.  General George Zarifis (retired) SV1AA.\r\n\r\n    As recorded in detail in chapter 5, George was undoubtedly the\r\nfirst Greek amateur to have two-way contacts using radio telephony,\r\nway back in 1921.  He was also the first amateur to operate from the\r\nisland of Crete in 1938.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Dr Costas Fimerelis SV1DH. (Transequatorial propagation).\r\n\r\n    On October 9th 1988 at 23.10 GMT a new world distance record was\r\nestablished on the 50 MHz band by the Greek experimental station SZ2DH\r\noperated by Costas Fimerelis SV1DH and a station in Tokyo, when it was\r\nproved that the signals had travelled a distance of 30,650 over the\r\nSouth American continent.  This is 15,000 kilometres more than the\r\nshort path between the two stations, over which there was absolutely\r\nno propagation at that moment in time.\r\n\r\n    A simple 5 element Yagi and a power of 100 watts was used at\r\nSZ2DH.  The contact was on CW but the signals were so strong that it\r\nmight well have been on SSB.  It is estimated that 8 hops were needed\r\nto cover this record distance.\r\n\r\n    Most people know by now that SV1DH was one of the principal\r\nstations involved in the very successful Transequatorial propagation\r\ntests which took place during the 21st sunspot cycle between 1977 and\r\n1983. Costas gave me a simplified explanation of the phenomenon first\r\nnoticed by Ray Cracknell ZE2JV and Roland Whiting 5B4WR way back in\r\nSeptember 1957, namely that VHF signals can travel great distances\r\nacross the equator (5,000 to 8,000 kilometres) during the years of\r\nhigh sunspot activity.\r\n\r\n    Costas said that usually stations located approximately the same\r\ndistance north and south of the magnetic (not geographic) equator can\r\ncontact each other shortly after sunset at both locations.  The first\r\nsuch QSO took place on the 10th April 1978 between ZE2JV and 5B4WR.\r\nTwo days later ZE2JV contacted George Vernardakis SV1AB and this\r\ncontact was followed a few days later with QSOs with SV1DH and SV1CS.\r\n(Fuller details of these contacts are given later in this book in the\r\ninterview with SV1AB).\r\n\r\n    In October 1976 there was a rumour that 145 MHz signals had been\r\nheard directly between Argentina and Venezuela.  With the imminent\r\nbeginning of sunspot cycle 21 many amateurs in the northern and\r\nsouthern hemispheres began organizing tests on 50,144,220 and 432 MHz.\r\nWithin less than a year successful 2-way contact was established\r\nbetween Argentina and Venezuela on 144 MHz.\r\n\r\n   Greece is favourably placed for TEP to countries in Africa where\r\nthere is considerable amateur radio activity, like Zimbabwe and the\r\nUnion of South Africa.  So towards the end of 1977 SV1AB and SV1DH\r\nbegan looking for colleagues in suitable geographic locations with the\r\nappropriate equipment and the time and inclination to engage in tests\r\nwhich could go on for months and months on end.  Very soon the\r\nfollowing stations agreed to participate in the tests.  The northern\r\ngroup included SV1AB, SV1DH, 5B4WR and 5B4AZ.  In the southern\r\nhemisphere participants were ZE2JV (now G2AHU), ZS6PW, ZS6DN, ZS6LN\r\nand ZS3B.\r\n\r\n    After 4 months of daily test schedules, early in 1978, successful\r\ncontacts took place on 144 MHz, some of which constituted world\r\ndistance records for that time, as can be seen in the accompanying\r\ntable.  Amateurs in Malta, Italy, France and Spain soon began to\r\nparticipate in the tests, as well as amateurs in other areas of South\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\n    It can be seen from the world map that the magnetic dip (shown as\r\na heavy line) is very different to the geographic equator.  The QTH of\r\nSV1AB is in a suburb 10 kilometres north of SV1DH's so George's\r\ncontacts with the stations in Africa always had that edge on them.\r\n\r\n    In South Africa Dave Larson ZS6DN had set up a beacon which was\r\nfirst heard in Athens by SV1AB in February 1979. Within a few days\r\nZS6DN had QSOs with SV1DH and SV1AB.  The latter contact was a world\r\ndistance record via the F-regions of the ionosphere because of the\r\nextra distance involved owing to the locations of the two Greek\r\nstations, as mentioned in the previous paragraph.\r\n\r\n    For anyone who may be interested very comprehensive reports of the\r\nwork done in transequatorial propagation during cycle 21 and earlier\r\nappeared in articles written by Ray Cracknell ZE2JV/G2AHU and Roland\r\nWhiting 5B4WR/G3UYO in the June/July/August 1980 issues of Radio\r\nCommunuication, the journal of the R.S.G.B. and in the\r\nNovember/December 1980 issues of QST.\r\n\r\n\r\n         RECORD TRANSEQUATORIAL PROPAGATION CONTACTS\r\n                 DURING SUNSPOT CYLE 21\r\n\r\n    Stations       MHz     Date     GMT    Km\r\n\r\nYV5ZZ/6 - LU1DAU  145.9  29/10/77  02.00  5,000~\r\nWorld  record  distance  on 144 MHz.

George Vernardakis SV1AB. (V.H.F.)\r\n\r\n    In March 1988 I visited George Vernardakis SV1AB (formerly F9QN of\r\nMarseilles, France) who spoke to me about his contribution to the\r\ntransequatorial tests and his other experiments in connection with\r\nMoonbounce, Meteor Scatter and Sporadic E propagation.\r\n\r\n    \"In 1965\" George told me, \"I was the only SV station equipped for\r\ncontacts via meteor scatter so it was easy for me to make contacts\r\nwith many European stations.  The longest distance I achieved was with\r\nUA1DZ a Physics Professor at the University of Leningrad in the Soviet\r\nUnion.\"\r\n\r\n   Norman: \"Forgive me for interrupting you, but please explain in\r\nsimple terms what you mean by meteor scatter.\"\r\n\r\n    George: \"Meteor scatter is a way of making contacts on 2 metres by\r\nreflection from meteorites--'shooting stars' as they are called\r\ncolloquially--which we see on clear nights during the summer.  Of\r\ncourse they are not falling stars at all--they are meteorites which\r\nburn up when they hit the earth's atmosphere, leaving the trail that\r\nwe see.  We take advantage of this phenomenon for bouncing our signals\r\noff the trail but unfortunately it is a very short-lived event.  Once\r\nwhen there were a lot of meteorites I was able to maintain contact\r\nwith LX1SI of Luxembourg for a whole three minutes on SSB.  It was\r\nduring the period of the Persides which usually occur for a week in\r\nAugust when the earth's orbit takes it through this cloud of space\r\ndebris.  Millions of meteorites can be as small as a grain of sand and\r\nof course leave no visible trail when they strike the earth's\r\natmosphere.  The earth goes through other major clusters in April and\r\nin December.  The phenomenon can also affect signals on lower\r\nfrequencies.  One can be in QSO on 20 metres via ground wave with a\r\nstation a couple of hundred miles away with signals around s2 to s3.\r\nSuddenly one or two words are heard at s9 which indicates a momentary\r\nreflection off a meteorite trail.\"\r\n\r\n    George also explained that in order to defeat the brevity of the\r\ntime when communication was possible it was customary to record a\r\nmessage on a tape recorder and transmit it at high speed. The other\r\nstation would also record at high speed and then play back at normal\r\nspeed to hear the message normally.\r\n\r\n    I asked SV1AB to tell me about Sporadic E propagation.\r\n\r\n    \"In this form of contact the signals are reflected from an ionised\r\narea 90 to 120 kilometres above the surface of the earth.  I have been\r\nhaving contacts by this method for about 18 years now even before the\r\nadvent of SSB on two metres.  I have had contacts with England and\r\nwith Moscow to the north-east of Athens. The phenomenon occurs for\r\nthree or four months during the summer, and never during the winter.\r\nThe ionisation moves very rapidly sometimes--you may be talking to a\r\nstation in Malta and he suddenly disappears and a station in\r\nYugoslavia comes up on the same frequency.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Every summer\" George continued, \"we get Troposcatter which allows\r\ncommunication on all frequencies from VHF to 10 GHz even. This type of\r\npropagation occurs during certain special meteorological conditions,\r\nlike high barometric pressure and extreme heat. We sometimes hear\r\nstations in Malta and Sicily with very loud signals.\"\r\n\r\n     \"In 1966 I built an aerial array consisting of 8 nine-element\r\nYagis for 2 metres with the axis of rotation pointing to the North\r\nStar enabling me to track the Moon automatically.  I was hoping to\r\nmake some Moonbounce contacts, but at that time it was very difficult\r\nto construct low noise preamplifiers.  After many days and hours of\r\ntrying I managed a single brief contact with F8DO in France.  Some\r\ntime later I heard that Mike Staal K6MYC had heard me in California.\r\n\r\n    \"The funny thing about this aerial array was that it enabled me to\r\nreceive television signals from Nigeria on Channel 3 but only when I\r\nraised it up to an elevation of nearly 90 degrees.\"\r\n\r\n    Norman: \"I understand that Costas Georgiou SV1OE is the only Greek\r\namateur who has had successful QSOs via Moonbounce.\"\r\n\r\n    George: \"Yes indeed.  But it was many years later, using a low\r\nnoise GASFET preamplifier.  K1WHS in the U.S.A.  has an array\r\nconsisting of 48 Yagis which enable him to contact stations with more\r\nmodest installations.\r\n\r\n   \"In 1970 a technician from Stanford University came to Athens\r\nbecause the tracking station they had set up on Mount Pendeli could\r\nnot pick the University's satellite, whereas they were getting good\r\nsignals from it in Spain.  One of the assistants at the station told\r\nthe American that he knew an amateur who could pick up signals from\r\nsatellites, meaning me.  The American, who happened to be an amateur\r\nhimself, immediately asked to see me.  When he saw my 8 antenna array\r\nhe suggested we should use it to try and pick up the University\r\nsatellite.  I pointed out to him that my array was for 144 MHz whereas\r\nthe satellite beacon was transmitting on 136 MHz.  He gave me the\r\ncoordinates for the next pass and I rotated and raised my array in\r\nanticipation.  When the exact time arrived my modest receiver picked\r\nup the satellite beacon loud and clear. The American got so excited he\r\nasked me if he could use my telephone to call the University in the\r\nU.S.A. He told them the satellite had been heard at last in Athens,\r\nand by an amateur no less. Later I received a letter from NASA\r\nthanking me for the assistance I had given. When the American left he\r\ngave me that 50 MHz converter you can see there on the shelf.\"\r\n\r\n    Norman: \"Tell me about your contribution to the transequatorial\r\ntests of 1979.\"\r\n\r\n    SV1AB: \"I had been in regular contact with ZS6LN on ten metres\r\nlong before Costas SV1DH appeared on the scene. I remember asking\r\nZS6LN why we should not receive South African stations on 2 metres\r\nwhen we could hear them so well on 50 MHz.  He had replied that the\r\ntwo frequencies behaved in a very different manner, but there was no\r\nharm in trying. He got ZS6PW and ZS6DN interested in the idea,\r\nparticularly ZS6DN who had much better aerials and a very good QTH.\r\nHe was the one who stood the better chance of being heard in Greece.\r\nWe arranged a schedule of transmitting and listening every evening.\r\nFirst they transmitted and we listened, and then we transmitted and\r\nthey listened, and contact was maintained on ten metres.\"\r\n\r\n    Norman: \"You said 'every evening'--do you mean that the Sun has\r\nsomething to do with this type of propagation?\"\r\n\r\n    George: \"Most certainly.  All the contacts that were made\r\nsubsequently were at least one hour after the relevant part of the\r\nionosphere was in darkness.\"\r\n\r\n    George then described how the first signals were heard via\r\ntransequatorial propagation.\r\n\r\n    George: \"First we heard the beacon on 144.160 MHz set up by Ray\r\nCracknell ZE2JV in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe).  The date was\r\nApril 12th 1978 at 18.00 G.M.T. Ten months later I heard ZS6DN's\r\nautomatic beacon with a colossal signal, but he was not at home!  I\r\nwent to 20 metres and put out a frantic CQ for any station in South\r\nAfrica but got no reply.  I returned to the cross-band frequency on 10\r\nmetres which we used regularly for 28/50 MHz QSOs and managed to\r\ncontact a station in South Africa who was very far away from ZS6DN but\r\nwho kindly offered to QSP a message by telephone.  He was told that\r\nZS6DN had gone out but would be back soon.  I was terrified that the\r\nopening would not last long enough.  But in a few minutes I heard him\r\ncalling me slowly on CW and we exchanged reports at 17.20 G.M.T on\r\nFebruary 16th 1979.  This was a new world record for the longest\r\ndistance on 2 metres.\r\n\r\n    \"Three days earlier, however, when I was not at home, Costas SV1DH\r\nhad established the first TEP contact between Greece and South Africa\r\nwhen he contacted ZS6DN. As you know, my location is a mere 10\r\nkilometres north of SV1DH's. I have a tape recording of my QSO with\r\nZS6DN as well as with ZS6PW whose signals came through a few minutes\r\nlater at 17.34 G.M.T.  on that historic evening.(The local time in\r\nAthens was 7.34 p.m.).Of course the distance record was broken again\r\non September 17th 1981 when I contacted ZS4BU who is 110 kilometres\r\nfurther south than ZS6DN.\"\r\n\r\n    Norman: \"Were all these contacts only on the key?\"\r\n\r\n    George: \"Yes, all the contacts were on CW. On several occasions we\r\ntried SSB but there was so much distortion that not a single word\r\ncould be identified.  TEP has a lot of flutter and fading and as you\r\ncan hear on the tapes even the morse comes through like a breathing\r\nnoise, not a clear tone. This applies to contacts between Greece and\r\nSouth Africa.  Contacts between Japan and Australia where the\r\ndistances involved are smaller, have been made on SSB.\"\r\n\r\n  Norman: \"What about cycle 22?\"\r\n\r\n  George: \"see how things go. If anything is achieved it should be in\r\n1990 or later.  With modern equipment we shall be able to hear signals\r\nthat were buried in the noise in 1979.\"\r\n\r\n4.  Dr Spyros Tsaltas SV1AT & George Delikaris SV1AM. (Mobile).\r\n\r\n    The first two licensed amateurs to make contact on 2 metres in\r\nGreece were Dr Spyros Tsaltas SV1AT and George Delikaris SV1AM. They\r\nhad put together the famous Heathkit 'TWOER'.  Crystals were plentiful\r\non the surplus market, but it was not easy to find two of the same\r\nfrequency.  SV1AT transmitted on 144.720 and SV1AM on 145.135 MHz. The\r\nfirst contact took place at 13.30 local time on the 21st of December\r\n1963.\r\n\r\n    A few days later SV1AT had a cross-band QSO with George\r\nVernardakis SV1AB who was transmitting in the 20 metre band on 14.250\r\nMHz A.M. as he had not completed his TWOER yet.\r\n\r\n    At that time SV1AT was the Secretary of the Radio Amateur\r\nAssociation of Greece.  He suggested to the Committee that the Club\r\nshould apply for a temporary licence to be granted to SV1AM enabling\r\nhim to transmit from his vehicle while in motion.  The licensing\r\nauthority gave the licence \"for experimental purposes only, and for a\r\nperiod not exceeding one month\".\r\n\r\n    And so it was that the first 'mobile' QSO took place on 2 metres\r\nbetween licensed Greek amateurs on the 27th of January 1965 at 19.25\r\nlocal time.  SV1AM was travelling in his car and SV1AT was at his home\r\nQTH.\r\n\r\n5.  Costas Tzezairlidis SV4CG. (SSTV).\r\n\r\n    In 1970 Costas Tzezairlidis SV4CG built a unique electro\r\nmechanical machine using two motors to achieve horizontal and vertical\r\nscanning.  He had found a motor which rotated at 960 R.P.M.  which\r\ncorresponds to 16 revolutions per second, the exact speed required for\r\nthe horizontal scanning.  The speed of the second motor was 1\r\nrevolution per second.  The reciprocal motion was produced by a cam\r\nthrough an 8:1 reduction gear.  A weight attached to the microscope\r\npulled it back to start the next line.  The microscope was focussed\r\nsharply on the drum carrying the picture to be transmitted. Resolution\r\nwas excellent.\r\n\r\n    The 'microscope' consisted of a cardboard tube with a 13 cm focal\r\nlength lens at one end and a Philips OAP12 photo-diode at the other\r\nwith another lens in front of it.  This primitive microscope produced\r\na picture of reasonable quality.\r\n\r\n    For reception SV4CG made a converter using the long persistence P7\r\nc.r.t.  With this set-up Costas had his first SSTV contact on 40\r\nmetres with SV1AB on February 28th 1971. After that he had many\r\ncontacts on 7 and 14 MHz as can be seen from the extract from his log.\r\n(The special commemorative prefix of SZ0 was used by all SV stations\r\nduring 1971).\r\n\r\n\r\n6.  Costas Georgiou SV1OE. (E.M.E.)\r\n\r\n    Up to the end of 1988 the only Greek amateur who had positively\r\nauthenticated Moonbounce contacts was Costas Georgiou SV1OE.  His very\r\nfirst contact was made in 1982 when he contacted VE7BQH in Canada on 2\r\nmetres.  In the ensuing four years Costas managed to work four more\r\nstations: K1WHS, SM4GVF, W5UN and KB8RQ.\r\n\r\n   In 1982 Costas had been trying for three years, without success, to\r\nhear his own signal via Moonbounce.  The reason for his failure was\r\nthat he was unaware of a very basic fact.\r\n\r\n    \"I was completely ignorant of the Doppler shift effect,\" Costas\r\ntold me.  \"The frequency of received signals varies according to the\r\nposition of the moon.  If it is to the East of your own location the\r\nsignals return 500 to 1,000 Hz below the original transmitted\r\nfrequency. For years I had been sending long dashes slowly and waiting\r\nto hear my signals return on the same spot, which they never did.\r\nThis happens for one instant only, when the Moon is at 180 degrees\r\nazimuth, exactly due south. When it moves to the west of south the\r\nreturning frequency is correspondingly higher.  Using a 50Hz audio\r\nfilter (which is essential for Moonbounce) it is very easy to miss the\r\nweak signals.  Soon after I found out my ridiculous mistake I began to\r\nhear my signals, naturally with a delay of one or two seconds because\r\nof the enormous distance involved--770,000 kilometres, 385,000 there\r\nand 385,000 back.\r\n\r\n    Costas continued: \"My next problem was finding the moon. I had no\r\ncomputer at the time and no Keplerian elements.  I mounted a small\r\nvideo camera in the centre of four 16-element Yagi antennas and\r\nrotated the elevation and azimuth motors until I could see the moon in\r\nthe centre of the monitor in the shack.  Of course when the sky was\r\novercast I was out of business.  Much later when I obtained a little\r\nSinclair ZX80 computer life became easier.\r\n\r\n   \"When I made my first contact I was simultaneously in QSO with\r\nSV1AB and SV1IO on 1,296 MHz who could hear what was going on.  I\r\nremember SV1AB got very excited and began shouting 'I can hear him, I\r\ncan hear him!' The QSO was with VE7BQH. Later Lionel sent me a very\r\nvaluable present, valuable not for its cost but for the fact that it\r\nwas something quite unobtainable in Greece at that time--a very\r\nlow-noise preamplifier for 2 metres.\r\n\r\n    \"After the successful launch of Oscar 10 those amateurs who had\r\ncomplex antenna systems and low-noise receivers they had used for\r\nMoonbounce congregated on 145.950 and spoke to each other on QRP which\r\nprevented ordinary mortals from hearing them.  By QRP I mean outputs\r\nof half a watt or less.  But when finally one day I broke into a net\r\nQSO I arranged schedules for Moonbounce with two stations in Sweden.\r\nI had a successful contact with one of them but never heard the other.\r\nThe reason may have been a very simple one: the polarisation of\r\nsignals returning from the Moon varies from one moment to the other,\r\nso if you have been transmitting with horizontal polarisation and go\r\nover to reception it is very easy to miss the answer of the other\r\nstation if the polarisation has changed.\"\r\n\r\n    SV1OE then explained the very strict procedure which must be\r\nadhered to for Moonbounce schedules.\r\n\r\n    \"Schedules are arranged to last one hour.  The first station to\r\nstart transmitting on the hour must be the one whose QTH lies to the\r\neast of the other. The calling frequency for Moonbounce is 144.011\r\nMHz., and the duration of the call is 2 minutes, but for the first\r\nminute and a half you call CQ DE SV1OE and during the last half minute\r\nyou also give the call of the station you are trying to contact, for\r\ninstance G3FNJ DE SV1OE.  You must on no account transmit for more\r\nthan two minutes because at the beginning of the third minute the\r\nother station will begin transmitting the same pattern of signals. But\r\nif he has heard you he will alter the pattern. For the first half\r\nminute he will send SV1OE DE G3FNJ and for the ensuing minute and a\r\nhalf he will transmit the letter O which signifies that he has heard\r\nyour callsign completely and without difficulty i.e. Q5 in the Q Code.\r\nIf I have also heard your callsign completely I will send G3FNJ for\r\nhalf a minute followed by RO for a minute and a half, which means that\r\nI have also received your callsign and your O. And you will reply RO\r\n73 which concludes the successful contact.\r\n\r\n    \"There are one or two other letters that can be used. Sending M\r\nsignifies that I hear you well but can only copy 50% of your\r\ntransmission, equivalent to Q3. And the letter T signifies I hear you\r\nbut cannot read you at all--Q1.\r\n\r\n    \"It has been found by experience that the best sending speed is 8\r\nw.p.m.  Sending slowly or very fast presents problems at the other\r\nend.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER EIGHT\r\n\r\n                 PERSONAL REMINISCENCES AND ANECDOTES\r\n\r\n    The eight items which follow are not strictly part of the story of\r\nthe development of amateur radio, but they deal with some historical\r\nevents which are connected with our hobby.  Two are of particular\r\ninterest: the account given to me by Takis Coumbias formerly SV1AAA of\r\nthe early days of amateur radio in Russia and the story of the Greek\r\nbroadcasts from Cairo, Egypt during the German/Italian occupation of\r\nGreece in World War II.\r\n\r\nNearly all the photographs of the period were taken by the author.\r\n\r\n1.  Athanasios 'Takis' Coumbias (1909-1987)\r\n\r\n    When I met Takis in his office in May 1983 I told him I was\r\nthinking of writing a small book about the history of amateur radio in\r\nGreece before it was too late--so many of the old timers had already\r\npassed away. Little did we both suspect at the time that he also would\r\nnot live to see the finished project. I asked him how far back he\r\ncould remember.\r\n\r\n    \"Well, I can start from 1924 when I was about 15 and living in\r\nOdessa in the Soviet Union. There was a lot of interest in wireless\r\nand two magazines were published in Russia which dealt mainly with the\r\nconstruction of receivers.  My interest was first aroused when a\r\nfriend of mine at school proudly showed me something he had just made.\r\nIt was, he told me, a variable capacitor and he was going to use it to\r\nmake a radio receiver.  The contraption was enormous by today's\r\nstandards and must have weighed about half a kilo. My friend said it\r\nhad a capacity of 250 micro-micro farads, which meant absolutely\r\nnothing to me at the time.\r\n\r\n    \"When he completed his receiver I became very interested and\r\ndecided I would build one too.  But materials were hard to find and\r\nvery expensive.  Two items one had to buy: valves and headphones.\r\n\r\n    \"I asked my friend where he had found the sheet metal to make the\r\nplates of the capacitor.  He took me to a row of small shops which had\r\na metal-faced ledge below the shop window.  The metal was thin and\r\nseemed easy enough to remove.  We sat on the ledge for a while and\r\nwhen the coast was clear we tore away a section and ran like mad.\r\nLater I ruined a pair of my mother's dressmaking scissors cutting out\r\nthe plates.  I used rings of some thick copper wire to space the\r\nplates but I could not drill holes in the plates for the spindle so a\r\nfriend did that for me.  I used about 15 plates and to this day I have\r\nno idea what the capacity of the finished capacitor was.  Some small\r\nitems for the receiver could be found in a little shop owned by an old\r\nman who charged exorbitant prices, so I decided I must go to Moscow\r\nfor the valve and a single headphone that I needed.\r\n\r\n    \"But Moscow was three days and two nights away by train, and it\r\nwas the middle of winter.  So what, you may ask. Like many others I\r\nhad to travel on the roof of a goods waggon.  I took with me a loaf of\r\nbread, a piece of cheese and two hard-boiled eggs.  My father said I\r\nmust be mad but he gave me some spending money and his blessing.\r\n\r\n    \"I had eaten my food by the end of the second day so when we\r\nstopped at Brensk which is famous for its 'piroushki' I decided to try\r\nthem.  They were kept warm in large metal tins ready for the arrival\r\nof the train.  There were seven varieties and I had one made with\r\nliver and a savoury sauce.\r\n\r\n    \"When I arrived in Moscow I went to see the Greek ambassador as I\r\nwas carrying a letter of introduction from my father who was acting\r\nConsul for Greece in Odessa, but it was Saturday and the ambassador's\r\noffice was closed. I learned later that only foreign establishments\r\nclosed at the week-end.  So I went to look for a cheap hotel.  Looking\r\nout of the bedroom window I saw a lot of people running in one\r\ndirection.  At that moment a woman brought me a towel and a small bar\r\nof soap, so I asked her what was going on outside. She said the\r\nbutcher near the hotel had just received some liver.  Would she buy me\r\nsome I said.  I gave her some money and she returned nearly two hours\r\nlater with the liver wrapped in newspaper.  When I opened it I saw it\r\nwas horse liver cooked with corn and it had an awful sour smell.  I\r\njust could not face it, although I was starving by now.\"\r\n\r\n    I asked Takis about the shops in Moscow.  He said he had found\r\nseveral shops with parts and some made-up receivers in the State owned\r\nshops.  He learned later that these receivers were made by amateurs\r\nbecause the factories only made equipment for the armed forces. He\r\nbought a triode valve called 'MICRO' and was told it had an\r\namplification factor of 7. He wrapped it carefully in cotton wool for\r\nthe return journey to Odessa. He also bought a dry battery pack which\r\ngave 80 volts, and an enormous single headphone for one ear which was\r\nex-army surplus.\r\n\r\n     When he returned home and began to build his receiver he raided\r\nhis mother's kitchen to build things like terminals, switches etc.\r\nThere was an electric bell circuit between the dining room and the\r\nkitchen and as they didn't use it his mother said he could dismantle\r\nit and use the wire, which was quite long because it went up into the\r\nloft and then down again to the kitchen.\r\n\r\n    \"I had acquired a small square of bakelite and I used a penknife\r\nto make a holder for the valve, twisting a few turns of wire round the\r\npins as I could find nothing to use as a socket. I had no idea how to\r\nconnect the various items I made or bought. I had seen a circuit\r\ndiagram in a French magazine of a detector with reaction.  I made the\r\nconnections by twisting wires together and finally the receiver was\r\ncomplete.  The next thing was the aerial.  I made an enormous aerial\r\nwith four parallel wires, like the aerials I had seen on ships.\r\nPutting it up was a dangerous operation as our house had a rather\r\nsteep tiled roof, so I got some friends to help me.  Some of them who\r\nhad 'superior knowledge' told me the down-lead must have no bends.  I\r\ngot hold of a stiff copper wire and supported the down-lead on two\r\nenormous bell insulators as used on telegraph poles.  I had to smash a\r\ncorner of my bedroom window to bring the wire in.  I had bought a\r\nlarge knife switch which could be turned over to connect the aerial to\r\nground.  I was afraid the large flat top of the aerial would attract\r\nthunderbolts.  When I finally connected the aerial to the receiver I\r\nheard ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.\"\r\n\r\n    I asked him how he tuned the receiver.  He said he had put many\r\ntaps on the coil and he twisted his antenna to these taps trying\r\nvarious combinations with the tuning capacitor.\r\n\r\n    \"All I heard was this breathing noise.  I learned later that it\r\nwas the 'carrier wave' of a broadcasting station without modulation,\r\nbut I didn't know what that meant. As my friends also heard the same\r\nnoise I was convinced my receiver was working.  We soon found out that\r\nthe long wave transmitter at Ankara, the capital of Turkey was making\r\ntest transmissions without modulation.  Ankara was one of the first\r\nbroadcasting stations in that part of the world.\"\r\n\r\n    Norman: \"Regeneration should have produced a whistle.\"\r\n\r\n    Takis: \"Yes, indeed.  And in a peculiar way.  When I approached\r\nthe receiver my hand produced the whistle.\"\r\n\r\n    Norman: \"Hand capacity effect.\"\r\n\r\n    Takis: \"And foot capacity effect as well!  When I approached my\r\nknee to the metal leg of the work-bench I would lose the station I had\r\nbeen listening to.\" He said the tuning capacitor he had made was\r\nobviously too small and he had to alter the taps on the coil\r\ncontinuously.  About three o'clock in the morning during a cold winter\r\nnight he heard a new sound--the breathing (carrier) noise and a sort\r\nof regular ticking. He later found out that it was the new\r\nbroadcasting station in Vienna, Austria, which transmitted the sound\r\nof a metronome throughout the night. This would have been about 1926.\r\n\r\n    I asked Takis about school.  \"In spite of the late nights\r\nlistening I never missed a day at school.  My father was the Chairman\r\nof the School Committee and I couldn't let him down. But I had to earn\r\nsome pocket money to pay for the bits a pieces I needed.  Particularly\r\na decent pair of headphones; I had to hold the army headphone to me\r\near with one hand which gave me pins and needles.  For some years I\r\nhad kept goldfish and pigeons, so I sold them. A friend of mine had\r\ngone to sea as a cadet and his ship went abroad, so I asked him to get\r\nme a pair of headphones.\r\n\r\n    \"I must explain to you that it was no easy matter for a Russian\r\nseaman to serve on a vessel which visited foreign ports.  First one\r\nhad to go through the Communist Party sieve and then he was told that\r\nif he jumped ship his family would suffer for it.\r\n\r\n    \"Anyway, he bought me a lovely pair of Telefunken headphones when\r\nthe ship berthed at Constantinople (Istanbul) which I have to this\r\nday.  But not on his first trip, when he was not allowed to go ashore.\r\nAnd it was not the captain who decided who could go ashore.  A trusted\r\nmember of the Party would pick out a group of seamen who could land\r\nbut they had to stay together the whole time.\r\n\r\n    \"I never managed to go abroad.  At the Club I had obtained a morse\r\ntest certificate for 40 letters a minute (8 wpm) in Latin characters\r\nand 90 letters (18 wpm) in the Cyrillic alphabet (Russian).  To go\r\nabroad one had to up-grade to 80 Latin and 120 Cyrillic letters.  (16\r\n& 24 wpm).  I was put on a small coastal ice-breaker which cleared the\r\nriver estuaries in the Black Sea.\r\n\r\n    \"The Black Sea is one of the most treacherous inland seas in the\r\nworld.  During the winter its northern shores are frozen whereas the\r\ncoast of Asia Minor keeps the southern shores relatively warm by\r\ncomparison.  This results in gale force winds and rough seas.  Waves\r\nfollow each other very closely as opposed to the long swell one gets\r\nin the Pacific.  Ships have to leave port to avoid crashing into each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n    \"I was about 18 when I first went to sea as a cadet W/T operator.\r\nOne day when we came out of an estuary the sea was so rough that the\r\ncaptain decided to turn back.  As we turned to starboard we noticed an\r\nAmerican freighter behind us heavily laden with wheat and very low\r\ndown in the water. To our horror it was caught between the crests of\r\ntwo enormous waves and broke in two roughly amidships.  Although we\r\nwere only about half a mile away the freighter sank before we could\r\nget to it.  We saw a few survivors in the water, but it would have\r\nbeen impossible to put a boat into that treacherous sea.  Apart from\r\nwhich a man cannot survive many minutes in a water temperature just\r\nabove freezing. It was all over in a flash and we returned to Odessa\r\nin deep shock.\r\n\r\n    \"Odessa used to have four harbours.  The callsign of the W/T\r\nstation was EU5KAO. I remember it very well because it was my job to\r\ntake the weather forecasts for shipping which it transmitted\r\nregularly.\"\r\n\r\n    Takis spoke about some amusing misconceptions of that period.\r\nWhen he first completed his receiver and was getting poor results with\r\nit he asked a more experienced amateur to look at it.  The 'expert'\r\nimmediately found the first fault: the downlead from the antenna had a\r\nbend in it of more than 45 degrees which was quite unacceptable.\r\nSecondly, the ground connection to the central heating radiator was no\r\ngood because it was winter and the radiator was hot so it presented a\r\nvery high resistance!  It must be soldered, he said, to a cold water\r\ntap.\r\n\r\n    \"I tried everything I could think of to solder the wire to the\r\ntap, but to no avail.  Then one day I had a brain-wave and I made a\r\nstupendous invention!  I wrapped a copper strip round the tap and\r\nbolted it tightly, together with the ground wire.  I was really very\r\nproud of myself and wondered if anybody else had ever thought of doing\r\nit that way.\"\r\n\r\n    I asked Takis if he had done any transmitting from home. \"We\r\namateurs of foreign origin were not allowed to own transmitters but we\r\ncould operate the club station under close supervision by the Party\r\nmember who was always present.  My own SWL callsign was RK-1136 as you\r\ncan see from the QSL card I received from EU5DN in 1929.\r\n\r\n    \"I remember our excitement when we first contacted a station\r\noutside Russia.  It was a station in Saarbrueken and we were on a\r\nwavelength of 42 metres.  All the members of the Club sent him our SWL\r\nreports and he sent us back his cards and a photograph of his\r\nequipment which was published in the Moscow amateur journal and so\r\nOdessa became famous.  On 42 metres most of our QSOs were with German\r\nstations. As a result of this success many young lads joined our club\r\nand we 'experts' would explain to them about bends in the aerial\r\ndown-lead and the high resistance of a ground connection to a central\r\nheating radiator when the water in it was hot!!\r\n\r\n    The club transmitter consisted of 4 valves in a Hartley parallel\r\npush-pull oscillator circuit which we considered to be of relative\r\n'high power'--perhaps all of 10 watts.\"\r\n\r\n    Takis continued: \"In 1930, my family, like many other families of\r\nGreek origin, moved to Athens.  I built a cw transmitter using four\r\nPhilips valves.  I went and saw Mr Eleftheriou at the Ministry and he\r\ninformed me that there was no way that he could issue me with a\r\ntransmitting licence, but he thanked me all the same for telling him I\r\nhad built a transmitter.\"\r\n\r\n    Takis continued: \"I would like you to notice these two QSL cards I\r\nreceived in 1933. I1IP wrote on his card 'I am on the air since 1924\r\nbut you are the first SV station I have heard'.  And the British\r\nlistener BRS1183 wrote 'Dear old man, very pleased to report your\r\nsignals.  Are you the only active station in SV?'  I think those\r\ncomments speak for themselves.\"\r\n\r\n    Norman: \"Had you not heard about Tavaniotis, who had also\r\nemigrated from Russia?\"\r\n\r\n    Takis: \"No.  It was you who took me to the basement shack and\r\nintroduced me. I remember how I gaped when I saw the 150 watt\r\ntransmitter Bill had built.\"\r\n\r\n    Takis then described how he had heard a distress signal on his\r\nhome-made receiver.  It was in a language he could not understand so\r\nhe called his father, who was quite a linguist, to listen.  It\r\nappeared that the vessel had caught fire as it was approaching the\r\nport of Piraeus, south of Athens. The captain of the ship said their\r\npredicament was complicated by the fact that they were transporting a\r\nlarge circus, with many wild animals.  Takis ran to the nearest Police\r\nstation and told his story, but was greeted practically with derision.\r\nHow could a young lad like him know there had been a fire on a ship\r\nwhich was not even in sight of the shore?  Anyway, somebody was\r\nbrought to the station and the officer said \"Go with this man.\"  Takis\r\nwas taken to the coast at Palaio Faliro where he boarded a salvage\r\ntug, and they set out to sea. He said the vessel in distress had been\r\nbound for Piraeus, and sure enough the salvage tug located it, but\r\nwhen they approached it there was no sign of fire as it had been put\r\nout, before any of the animals could be harmed. But the engine room\r\nhad been damaged, so the tug towed the vessel into harbour.  What\r\nCoumbias didn't know was that by law he was entitled to a proportion\r\nof the salvage money, and he never got anything.\r\n\r\n    Another incident involving a small yacht which belonged to a\r\nfriend of Takis' led to an interesting assignment.  The yacht was\r\nconsidered to be not seaworthy any more, and a W/T transmitter it\r\ncarried was dismantled completely by an electrician who knew nothing\r\nabout wireless.\r\n\r\n    \"I was asked to put it together again by the owner who wanted to\r\nsell it to the ship to shore W/T station where they did not have a\r\nshort wave capability yet.  When I was shown the parts I was horrified\r\nto see that there was no circuit diagram or instructions of any sort.\r\nIt took me more than a month to figure it all out.  The transmitter\r\nwas of French manufacture and consisted of two enormous triodes in a\r\nHartley oscillator circuit.  When I got it to work it was installed at\r\nthe Naval Wireless station at Votanikos, where the Director, Captain\r\nKyriakos Pezopoulos used it for experimental transmissions. There were\r\nalready two other transmitters there, one on Long Waves and one on 600\r\nmetres.  The callsign of the station was SXA.  As this was the third\r\ntransmitter they used the callsign SXA3.  The operator, Lt. George\r\nBassiacos, had discovered some telegraphy stations which replied when\r\nhe called them--he had accidentally stumbled upon the amateur 20\r\nmetre band!  With a transmitter supplied with unrectified A.C.  at 400\r\nHz.  and a power output of several kilowatts, no wonder contacts with\r\nany part of the world were easy. When Captain Pezopoulos met Bill\r\nTavaniotis the latter suggested that if the 'experimental'\r\ntransmissions were to continue in the amateurs bands, the callsign\r\nshould be altered to SX3A.  Thousands of successful contacts were made\r\nas it was the beginning of sunspot cycle 16, a very good one as old\r\ntimers will know. If anyone reading this has a QSL card from SX3A it\r\nwould be appreciated if he would donate it to the Technical Museum in\r\nGreece.\"\r\n\r\n   (Takis Coumbias died suddenly of a heart attack in September 1987.)\r\n\r\n2. Pol Psomiadis N2DOE (formerly SV1AZ).\r\n\r\n    The text which follows was written by Pol N2DOE of Bergenfield NJ.\r\n\r\n    Norman Joly and I first met in 1935 when I started working with\r\nBill SV1KE as his radio mechanic.  Norman was then working for the\r\nlocal agents of RCA selling broadcast receivers. The last time I saw\r\nhim before the war, was in September 1939. I was still working with\r\nBill and I went to the British School of Archaeology in Athens to\r\ndeliver a National NC 100 with a Spiderweb all-band antenna.  Norman\r\nhad been recruited to set up a monitoring station for the Press\r\nDepartment of the British Embassy, which had been moved to a building\r\nin the grounds of the school. After the end of the war I saw him again\r\nin 1948 in the uniform of a Superintendent of Police working in the\r\nBritish Police Mission to Greece.  He told me he had obtained a\r\nspecial licence and was back on the air with his pre-war callsign\r\nSV1RX.\r\n\r\n    In 1951 I emigrated to Brazil where I stayed for 17 years and then\r\ncame to the U.S.A. in 1968, where I have been ever since. We had lost\r\ncontact with each other and it was five years later that I found\r\nNorman's address in the American callbook.  I wrote to him and in his\r\nreply he begged me to come on the air again.  Owing to a prolonged\r\nfamily illness which culminated in the loss of my beloved wife it was\r\n1980 before I was in the mood to take up amateur radio once again,\r\nwith my present callsign N2DOE.\r\n\r\n    When I went to London in 1984 to spend a few weeks with Norman he\r\ntold me he had started recording some reminiscences on a tape recorder\r\nabout the first radio amateurs in Greece, and he asked me if I would\r\nlike to help.  As I was one of them myself I agreed.  When I left to\r\nreturn to the U.S.A.  he gave me a number of cassettes to transcribe.\r\nAlthough he speaks fluent Greek without any accent at all, he never\r\nattended a Greek school and couldn't write the memories.  He told me\r\nto add anything else I could remember about those pioneering days long\r\ngone by.\r\n\r\n    So, to start from the beginning, let me say that I was born in\r\nConstantinople (now Istanbul) in Turkey, in October 1910, of Greek\r\nparents.  Although we spoke Greek at home I did not go to a Greek\r\nschool until I was nine.  But I soon moved to the French College where\r\nall the lessons were in French and Greek was only taught as a foreign\r\nlanguage for two hours every afternoon.\r\n\r\n    My elder brother had subscribed to a French magazine called 'La\r\nScience et La Vie' (Science & Life) and I had become fascinated by a\r\nsubject called 'Telegrafie sans fil' (Telegraphy without wire).  The\r\nbroadcasting of speech and music had not started yet in that part of\r\nthe world, though in 1923, a broadcasting station was built in Ankara\r\nthe capital of Turkey.  Broadcast receivers began to appear in the\r\nshops, either with headphones or large horn loudspeakers, but we never\r\nhad one at home.\r\n\r\n    In 1926 we moved to Athens, Greece, where I went to school.\r\nStrangely enough, as I found out later, that was the year when Norman\r\nalso came to Athens for the first time.  At school I met Nasos\r\nCoucoulis (later SV1SM and SV1AC) who was also very interested in\r\nwireless. I made a crystal receiver and was able to hear the Greek\r\nRoyal Navy station at Votanikos SXA and the old station at Thiseon in\r\nAthens itself, which was still a spark station.  There just was\r\nnothing else to hear.  I acquired a Philips 'E' type valve and built a\r\ngrid-leak detector circuit, but all I got was silence.  The four volt\r\nheater drew one amp and I had been trying to get it going with a small\r\ntorch battery.  As I became more experienced I began repairing simple\r\nbroadcast receivers for my friends and putting up wire antennas for\r\nreception for people who had bought broadcast receivers.\r\n\r\n    In 1929 Nasos and I were in our final year at the Megareos School.\r\nWe built a very simple AM transmitter tuned to about 500 metres and we\r\nbroadcast the performance of a play acted by the final year students.\r\nI have no idea if anybody heard our transmission, but it was certainly\r\nthe first amateur broadcast in Greece.\r\n\r\n    Nasos and I spoke to each other with very simple AM transmitters\r\nacross the 60 metres or so separating our homes, again without knowing\r\nwhether anybody else ever accidentally tuned in to our very low power\r\ntransmissions.\r\n\r\n    In 1932 I was called up for my compulsory Military service and\r\nended up attending the Reserve Officers Cadet School.  After my\r\nmilitary training I started work at the Lambropoulos Brothers shop in\r\nthe Metohikon Tameion building.  It was there that I made the\r\nacquaintance of Takis Coumbias, who had come to Greece from Russia\r\nwith his family.  Takis had had eight years experience of amateur\r\nradio in Russia, and he told us how the radio clubs operated under the\r\nstrict supervision of the Communist Party.\r\n\r\n    Three years later, in 1935, I moved to Tavaniotis' workshop as his\r\nmechanic.  'Bill' had built an AM and CW transmitter with an output of\r\n150 watts.  He used the callsign SV1KE.  We had regular contacts with\r\nGeorge Moens SU1RO in Cairo, Egypt. George is still active in his\r\nnative land of Belgium with the callsign ON5RO in Brussels. He should\r\nbe well into his 80s by now.  In 1938 George came to Athens with his\r\nwife Beba and their little boy Robert to visit her parents who were\r\nGreek, and of course they came to our shack and we had the pleasure of\r\nmeeting them in person after many years of chatting over the air.\r\n\r\n     In Greece we are 7 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time and so\r\nour contacts with the U.S.A. took place well after midnight, our time.\r\nOne of the stations we contacted very regularly was Charles Mellen\r\nW1FH in Boston.  Chas was born in Boston of Greek parents.  His father\r\ncame to Greece in 1936 or 1937 with Charles' younger sister, a pretty\r\nlittle girl of about 14.  They came to Bill's shack and were able to\r\nspeak to Boston with the equipment shown in this photograph taken by\r\nNorman.  After the end of World War II W1FH together with W6AM of\r\nCalifornia were the two leading stations in the U.S.A.  topping all\r\nthe achievement tables.  But W6AM had a slight advantage; he had\r\nbought a site previously belonging to Press Wireless which had 36\r\nrhombics whereas W1FH always operated with his simple Yagi at 60 feet.\r\n\r\n    Another station with which we had frequent contacts on 20 metres\r\nwas W2IXY owned by Dorothy Hall. One night Dorothy gave us a big\r\nsurprise.  In the course of a QSO she told us to listen carefully.\r\nSuddenly the three or four of us in SV1KE's shack heard our voices\r\ncoming back from New York.  Dorothy had recorded our previous\r\ntransmission on a disc.  A few days later we turned the tables on her.\r\nWe had hastily put together some recording equipment and played back\r\nher transmission. Dorothy said that was the first time she had heard\r\nher voice coming from 5,000 miles away.  I must explain that at that\r\ntime (about 1933) home recording was a novelty even in the U.S.A.\r\nRecording on vinyl tape was invented by Telefunken towards the end of\r\nthe war in 1945. Today even little children play with cassette\r\nrecorders, and the latest revolutionary home recording system invented\r\nby Japan DAT (Digital Audio Tape) provides high fidelity studio\r\nquality with no background noise; really a 'super' version of the mini\r\ncassette recorder.\r\n\r\n    In Athens we continued to operate even through the Dictatorship of\r\nGeneral Metaxas which began with a coup in August 1936, but not\r\nwithout some problems.  The main target of the infamous Maniadakis,\r\nMinister of the Interior under Metaxas, were of course the Communists,\r\nbut the handful of radio amateurs also came under suspicion of being\r\nsubversive elements.  Things got worse, in fact, when the newspaper\r\nESTIA owned by K. Kyrou, published an article blaming 'amateurs' for\r\nbeing responsible for interference to short wave reception.  I must\r\nexplain that the writer was referring to the dozens of pirate low\r\npower broadcasting stations operating in the medium wave (broadcast)\r\nband.  Regretably, I have to place on record that owing to the late\r\ndevelopment of broadcasting and official recognition of amateur radio\r\nin Greece, the word 'amateur' in the minds of the general public\r\nembraces CBers, pirates of all kinds operating on medium waves and\r\nrecently in the FM band, and genuine licensed amateurs as well.  So,\r\nas I was working in the basement workshop at SV1KE's one afternoon,\r\nthree of Maniadakis' plain-clothes men turned up and said they had\r\ncome to seize 'the broadcasting equipment'.  Fortunately Bill was not\r\nin the shop when they came.  I asked them if they had a search warrant\r\nand they said no.  I replied that I was only an employee and could\r\nthey call back a little later when Mr Tavaniotis himself would be\r\nthere to answer their questions, and thus managed to get rid of them.\r\nWhen Bill returned I told him about the incident and he left straight\r\naway and went to the Ministry of Posts & Telegraphs to see Mr.\r\nStefanos Eleftheriou.  And so it came about that Eleftheriou who knew\r\nall about our activity in the amateur bands issued the first three\r\nlicences to SV1KE, SV1CA and SV1NK 'to carry out experimental\r\ntransmissions relating to the study of propagation on the short\r\nwaves'.  He knew that he had every right to do this as Greece was a\r\nsignatory to the international telecommunication treaties.\r\n\r\n     I would like to record at this point that Aghis Cazazis SV1CA now\r\na silent key, has left his own 'monument' in Athens.  After the end of\r\nWorld War II, in his capacity as Head of Lighting Development with the\r\nElectricity authority, he designed the magnificent floodlighting of\r\nthe Acropolis which is admired by tourists to the present day.\r\n\r\n    To return to 1937: Mr Eleftheriou entrusted us with the task of\r\npreparing draft legislation for legalising amateur radio activity.  We\r\nwrote to the U.S.A., to England, France and Germany and obtained\r\ncopies of the laws governing the issue of licences in all these\r\ncountries, and we began the long task of drafting a text which would\r\nbe appropriate to the political situation then prevailing in our\r\ncountry (military dictatorship).  Norman Joly, then SV1RX, had written\r\na text in English, but before we could translate it into Greek or do\r\nanything about it, all our hopes were dashed to the ground by the\r\noutbreak of war in September 1939.\r\n\r\n    In 1944 while serving as a reserve officer in the Greek army, I\r\nwas seconded to the British Military Mission to Greece (B.M.M.)\r\nbecause of my knowledge of English and French. There I met several\r\namateurs serving with the British forces, and one of them gave me a\r\nsmall military transmitter, so I was able to come on the air again\r\nwith my old callsign of SV1AZ.\r\n\r\n3. Constantine 'Bill' Tavaniotis (formerly SV1KE).\r\n\r\n    There is no doubt that the most active and best known amateur in\r\nGreece before World War II was 'Bill' SV1KE. He was active on 20 and\r\n10 metres on AM phone and CW, using his famous McElroy 'bug' to good\r\nadvantage.  (No electronic keyers and no 15 metre band in those\r\nyears).\r\n\r\n    Tavaniotis was born in Rostov, USSR, of Greek parents.  His father\r\nwas a well-known doctor.  Like many other Greek families Bill and his\r\nparents left Russia in the early years of the Communist regime and\r\nmoved to Istanbul, Turkey, where he began his studies at the famous\r\nRobert College. Later he went to London where he first came into\r\ncontact with radio amateurs, while studying Electrical Engineering.\r\nAfter that he went to Belgium.\r\n\r\n    Bill had a knack of picking up languages and when I met him in\r\nAthens in the early thirties he spoke at least seven to my knowledge:\r\nRussian, Greek, English, French, Italian, Turkish and German.  His\r\npronunciation in all them was excellent.  On one occasion at a party\r\nin the Athens suburb of Palaio Psyhico one of the guests was an\r\namateur from Italy who spoke no English, so Bill interpreted from that\r\nlanguage into Italian for his benefit.  He then translated what the\r\nItalian had said into English for the others.  But suddenly their\r\nfaces went blank. Quite unconsciously Bill had translated the\r\nItalian's remarks into Turkish!  Many years later Bill was employed at\r\nthe United Nations in New York as a simultaneous translator.  In\r\nOctober 1946 Bill and his wife Artemis visited Charles Mellen W1FH in\r\nBoston for an 'eyeball' after more than ten years of QSOs over the\r\nair, with the exception of the war years of course.  Chas photographed\r\nBill outside the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Bill\r\nphotographed Mary (Chas' xyl), Chas and Artemis standing in front of\r\nthe W1FH tower.\r\n\r\n    The first transmitter he built can be seen in the photo taken from\r\nthe book GREEK BROADCASTING published by Radio Karayianni in 1952.\r\nHis shack was in the basement workshop at 17a, Bucharest Street in\r\nAthens, an address which became known world-wide as the first QSL\r\nbureau for Greece.\r\n\r\n    The gang of enthusiasts who met at Bill's included Nasos Coucoulis\r\nSV1SM, Aghis Cazazis SV1CA, Nick Katselis SV1NK, Mikes Paidousi SV1MP,\r\nPol Psomiadis SV1AZ (now N2DOE) and the writer of these memoirs,\r\nSV1RX. Of course all visiting amateurs made a beeline for the shack\r\nin the basement.  As most of our contacts were with the U.S.A.  we\r\nwere usually up most of the night because of the 7-hour difference\r\nwith Eastern Standard Time.  None of us had motor-cars and public\r\ntransport was not available during the night hours so we all got\r\nplenty of exercise walking back to our respective houses.\r\n\r\n    Bill was closely in touch with two men who played a very important\r\nrole in the development of amateur radio in Greece.  I am referring to\r\nStefanos Eleftheriou who was Section Head for Telecommunications at\r\nthe Ministry (Greek initials T.T.T.)., and to Captain Kyriakos\r\nPezopoulos, Director of D.R.Y.N.  (Greek initials for Directorate of\r\nthe Wireless Service of the Navy).  The long wave spark transmitter at\r\nVotanikos, a suburb of Athens, (callsign SXA) had been built by the\r\nMarconi company before World\r\n\r\n   (Bill Tavaniotis died of cancer in 1948.)\r\n\r\n4. Harry Barnett G2AIQ (formerly SV1WE).\r\n\r\n    In July 1946, Harry Barnett, a Royal Air Force officer attached to\r\nthe Press Department of the British Embassy in Athens obtained an\r\nexperimental transmitting licence from the W/T section of the Ministry\r\nof Posts & Telegraphs, with the callsign SV1WE.  At that time he was\r\nliving in a flat in Athens and could not put up an antenna, so it was\r\nnot until June 1947 that he became active.\r\n\r\n    The terms of his licence were in themselves rather strange, one\r\nmight even say quite 'experimental', the final paragraph reading:\r\n\r\n       \"This  experimental  research  must  be  carried  out   as\r\n       follows:-\r\n\r\n       1. With a maximum power of 50 watts.\r\n       2. In the frequency bands (harmonics) 130, 260, 520 Mc/s.\r\n       3. In the frequency bands 28 Mc/s and 56 Mc/s.\r\n       4. With the call sign SV1WE.\"\r\n\r\n    From June 1947 until April 1948 Harry worked 61 countries, mostly\r\non phone in the 10 & 20 metre bands, at a time when there were not\r\nmany stations on the air--a minute fraction of the millions now\r\nactive.\r\n\r\n    He used a National HRO receiver he had got off a scrap heap which\r\nhe modified to take the efficient EF50 valves in the R.F.  stages and\r\nEF39s in the I.F.\r\n\r\n    The transmitter was completely 'home brew', consisting of a metal\r\n6L6 Franklin oscillator on 3.5 MHz followed by two more 6L6s doubling\r\nto 14 MHz.  In the final amplifier stage Harry used a Telefunken\r\npentode, the famous and very efficient RL12P35 which was used in the\r\nGerman tank transmitters in all stages, oscillator, P.A.  and audio\r\namplifier/suppressor grid modulator.  He adopted the same method of\r\nmodulation using a record player amplifier and an Astatic crystal\r\nmicrophone.\r\n\r\n    W.A.C.  was achieved by February 1948 with about 50 watts of R.F.\r\ninto a simple dipole antenna.  During the ten months that SV1WE was\r\nactive 750 QSL cards were sent out. Of the 61 countries worked only 49\r\nwere confirmed.\r\n\r\n    Today (1989) Harry is still regularly on the air under his\r\noriginal callsign G2AIQ which was first issued to him on the 1st of\r\nJanuary 1938, 51 years ago.\r\n\r\n5.  George Yiapapas (formerly SV1GY).\r\n\r\n     George Yiapapas is a Greek amateur who was very active for over\r\n25 years yet nobody seems to have heard of him.  In 1935 George and\r\nhis father Costas built a one-valve transmitter using a type 59\r\npentode with suppressor grid modulation, and succeeded in contacting\r\nmost of the world with this QRP rig.  The electron coupled oscillator\r\ncould not have put more than 4 or 5 watts into the antenna.\r\n\r\n    After the war George went to Jordan in 1956 to work for Cable &\r\nWireless the English company which operated the old Eastern Telegraph\r\ncable network.  He used the callsign JY1GY for about a year and was\r\nthen transferred to Tripoli in the Kingdom of Lybia, during the reign\r\nof King Idris, where he obtained an official licence with the call\r\n5A3TA.\r\n\r\n    In 1960 he was again transferred, this time to Kuwait, where he\r\noperated the equipment of Mohamet Behbehani 9K2AM for over six years.\r\nGeorge now has a small shop in Piraeus, the port of Athens and is no\r\nlonger active on the amateur bands.\r\n\r\n6. Stefanos Eleftheriou (1895-1979).\r\n\r\n    Stefanos Eleftheriou, Head of the Telecommmunications section of\r\nthe Ministry of Posts & Telegraphs (Greek initials T.T.T.)  played a\r\nvital role in the early development of amateur radio in Greece.\r\n\r\n    When he returned from Switzerland, where he had studied Electrical\r\nEngineering, he had to do his compulsory military service which had\r\nbeen deferred while he was completing his education. A friend of his\r\ntold him \"Don't go into the Army, join the Navy; they have an amazing\r\nwireless station at Votanikos with which they can contact the Fleet\r\nanywhere in the world\".  As it happened there was a vacancy for an\r\nofficer and Stefanos together with another young man called Nikolis\r\nfaced a Selection Board of naval officers who really didn't know what\r\nqualifications they were looking for.  He was successful whereas\r\nNikolis went to the Ministry of Posts & Telegraphs where he ended up\r\nas Director-General many years later.\r\n\r\n    The MARCONI COMPANY of England had built an impressive wireless\r\nstation for the Greek Royal Navy at Votanikos, a suburb of Athens.\r\nThere was a transmitter which operated on 600 metres and a larger one\r\non long waves above 2,000 metres which used the callsign SXA.\r\n\r\n    Stefanos told me how he was summoned by the Director of the Naval\r\nStation Admiral Mezeviris who asked him \"Tell me, young man, what do\r\nyou know about wireless?\"\r\n\r\n    \"Well sir,\" replied Eleftheriou, \"I studied Electrical Engineering\r\nin Switzerland--I really don't anything about wireless.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Neither do I,\" replied the Admiral candidly. \"Nor do most of my\r\nofficers.  We must set up a school to train technicians and wireless\r\noperators.  I entrust you with the task of getting all the necessary\r\nbooks and other materials.  Write to England, the U.S.A., France and\r\nGermany and get whatever you need.  When you are ready I will appoint\r\nstaff to assist you.\"  That was how Eleftheriou became the head of the\r\nfirst school for training wireless officers for the Greek Royal Navy.\r\n\r\n    A couple of years later Eleftheriou joined the staff of the\r\nMinistry of Post & Telegraphs.  A newspaper of 1930 had a photograph\r\nof him with one of his triplet sons.\r\n\r\n    In his capacity of Head of the Telecommunications Section at the\r\nMinistry he worked hard to get official recognition of amateur radio.\r\nA handful of us who were active 'under cover' so to speak, frequently\r\nvisited him in his office.  He was a very likeable person and had a\r\ntalent for anecdotes.  One day he told us that he had attended a Joint\r\nServices Committee which had been set up to study the requirements for\r\nbuilding a broadcasting station in Athens.  A station had been in\r\nregular operation in the northern city of Thessaloniki (Salonica)\r\nsince 1928, built by the pioneer of Broadcasting in the Balkans\r\nChristos Tsingeridis.\r\n\r\n    When the question of wavelength for the proposed station was\r\nconsidered somebody said a wavelength of 2,000 metres might be\r\nappropriate. One of the military officers, who shall be nameless,\r\nremarked angrily \"What!  2,000 metres.  We are spending all this\r\nmoney only to be received up to Koukouvaounes?  This is outrageous!\"\r\n(Koukouvaounes was then a small village with a funny name about 3\r\nmiles south-west of Athens.\r\n\r\n    Eleftheriou lived to the ripe old age of 84.  When I last saw him\r\nhe promised to give me his collection of old photographs and a large\r\nnumber of books and documents relating to the development of radio\r\ncommunications in Greece.  Unfortunately, shortly after his death his\r\nwife and three sons moved house temporarily and a packing case\r\ncontaining all these priceless papers was lost in\r\n\r\n7.  Norman F. Joly G3FNJ. (Formerly SV1RX).\r\n\r\n    I was born in Izmir (then known as Smyrna), on the west coast of\r\nTurkey in Asia Minor, in 1911, of British parents.  My British\r\nnationality was established through the Treaty of Capitulation which\r\nwas then in force between Turkey and the United Kingdom of Great\r\nBritain and Northern Ireland.  I remember there was a British Post\r\nOffice in Smyrna and we posted our letters with British postage stamps\r\n(of King Edward VII) overprinted with the word LEVANT.\r\n\r\n    My grandmother on my father's side had come from Russia.  It is a\r\nstrange coincidence that Takis Coumbias (ex SV1AAA), Bill Tavaniotis\r\n(ex SV1KE) and I all had roots in southern Russia.  My grandmother on\r\nmy mother's side was the daughter of the Dutch consul in Smyrna. Quite\r\na mixed bag.\r\n\r\n    In 1922, at the end of the war between Turkey and Greece, the town\r\nof Smyrna was destroyed by fire when the Greek army was routed.  My\r\nwidowed mother with four young children, was advised to take us on\r\nboard a British merchant vessel while the town changed hands.  We were\r\ntold to take a little food with us just for a day or two.  We carried\r\na large string bag with some bread, cheese and fruit, and one knife,\r\none fork and one spoon between the five of us. I remember it was night\r\nand my mother put all her jewelry in a small leather bag.  As I\r\npulled the cord to close it the pin of a large broach stuck out\r\nthrough the top. My mother grabbed it and said I would hurt myself--I\r\nwas only 11 years old at the time. She looked around the bedroom,\r\nlifted up a corner of the mattress of her bed and hid the pouch\r\n'safely' underneath it.  We hurried out of the house--and never went\r\nback.\r\n\r\n    We and many other families spent one night on the merchant vessel\r\nwhere there was no sleeping accommodation.  Next morning we were\r\ntransferred to a large hospital ship called MAINE. All day we watched\r\nsmall groups of the Turkish and Greek armies skirmishing on the\r\nsea-front and in the evening many fires broke out in the town.  In the\r\nmiddle of the night while we were sleeping the hospital ship sailed\r\naway to an unknown destination. After two or three days we arrived in\r\nMalta, where most of us stayed for the next four years.\r\n\r\n     It was in Malta that my interest in wireless telegraphy was first\r\naroused.  We were housed in some military 'married quarters'.  Close\r\nby there was a wireless station which produced bright greenish-blue\r\nsparks and crackling noises.  Its antennas were supported on three\r\nvery tall wooden masts painted bright yellow.  I soon discovered that\r\nit was GYZ belonging to the Admiralty.  Malta was then (1922) a very\r\nbig base of the British Navy, in the good old days when England had an\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\n    I bought a kit of parts and assembled a small receiver and being\r\nso close to the powerful spark transmitter that was all I ever heard.\r\n\r\n    In 1926 when I left school my family moved to Greece and my\r\nbrother who was 7 years older than me, opened up a shipping office on\r\nthe island of Mitylene, in the Aegean sea.  My father and grandfather\r\nhad been in this business in Turkey.\r\n\r\n    It was in Mitylene in 1927 that I constructed my first short wave\r\nreceiver.  It had 3 valves with 4 volt filaments, heated by an\r\naccumulator (storage battery).  H.T of 130 volts was obtained from a\r\nbank of small accumulators in series. As I had not learned how to make\r\na charger I had to carry these two units to a local garage regularly\r\nfor re-charging.\r\n\r\n    Apart from commercial telegraph stations there was little else to\r\nhear. I had still not heard about 'amateur' radio.  The B.B.C.  was\r\ncarrying out test transmissions from Chelmsford for what became the\r\nEmpire Service (now the World Service) using the callsign G5SW.  There\r\nwas also G6RX which stood for Rugby Experimental, operated by the\r\nBritish Post Office.  They were experimenting with ship-to-shore\r\ntelephony, and after setting up a circuit the operator used to say\r\n\"over to condition A\" (and sometimes B) which was very frustrating for\r\nme because the voices then became scrambled and quite unintelligible.\r\nWhen I first began transmitting six years later, having 'discovered'\r\nthe amateurs, I chose the callsign RX as I had been a listener so\r\nlong, and also remembering the excitement of listening to G6RX.\r\n\r\n    In 1930 I moved to Athens and became a salesman for RCA radios. It\r\nwas there that I met Bill Tavaniotis, SV1KE, and his mechanic Pol\r\nSV1AZ (now N2DOE).  None of us had official licences because the Greek\r\nState did not recognise the existence of amateur radio, and in fact\r\nAthens did not even have a broadcasting station until 1938, although a\r\nstation had been operating since 1928 in Salonica (Thessaloniki) the\r\nsecond largest city of Greece.  But the Head of the W/T section at the\r\nMinistry of Posts & Telegraphs (Greek initials T.T.T) Mr Stefanos\r\nEleftheriou knew all about us and gave us his unofficial blessing.\r\n\r\n    My first transmitter was just an electron coupled oscillator using\r\na type 59 output pentode from a radio.  With an input of around 5\r\nwatts I was able to achieve W.A.C.  on 14 MHz in 25 minutes one very\r\nexciting afternoon. There were very few stations around and single\r\nfrequency working had not been heard of yet. It was the middle of the\r\nsunspot cycle (which I knew nothing of) and propagation must have been\r\nexceptionally good.\r\n\r\n    Another thing we had never heard of in those innocent days was\r\nSWR.  I had a Hot Wire ammeter and always tuned for maximum\r\ndeflection, completely oblivious of the fact that a large proportion\r\nof the indicated value was 'reflected power'.  I moved to 'high power'\r\nwhen I added a 210 P.A. to my rig.\r\n\r\n    Obviously the prefix SV was quite a rare one and SV stations were\r\nmuch sought after, particularly the handful who used CW.  But as I\r\ndescribed in a short article in the October 1948 issue of the SHORT\r\nWAVE MAGAZINE published in London, it was not all fun being a rare DX\r\nstation. A photo copy appears below:\r\n\r\n    To return to pre-World War II operating: Most operators used\r\ncrystal oscillators in order to have a clean '9x' note.  It was quite\r\nnormal procedure to call CQ on one's crystal frequency, say 14,076 KHz\r\nand then go over and start combing the band from 14,000 for replies.\r\nAt that time 20 metres covered 14,000 to 14,400 KHz., and the 15 metre\r\nband had not been allocated to the amateur service.\r\n\r\n    In September 1939 Hitler invaded Poland and all of us hastily and\r\nvoluntarily dismantled our transmitters and scattered the components,\r\nas there was nobody to order us to close down.\r\n\r\n    In the latter part of April 1941 the German army marched into the\r\nnorthern suburbs of Athens at 11 o'clock in the morning. At 3 o'clock\r\nin the afternoon of the same day, a strong unit of the Gestapo arrived\r\nin the southern suburb of Kallithea and surrounded the block in which\r\nmy house was situated and broke into it, looking for me and my\r\ntransmitter.  Of course I had dismantled everything 19 months\r\npreviously and even taken down the antenna.  So after this long period\r\nof QRT how did they know where to find me?  Well, FOUR YEARS EARLIER I\r\nhad won the first prize for Greece in the D.A.S.D.  DX Contest for\r\n1937 and the German society had sent me a nice certificate.  You can\r\ndraw your own conclusions.  I heard later (because I had left a few\r\ndays earlier for Egypt with the staff of the British Embassy) that the\r\nGestapo had visited all the active amateurs and had managed to arrest\r\nonly one of them, Nasos Coucoulis SV1SM (later SV1AC) and put him in a\r\nconcentration camp in Italy for nearly a year.\r\n\r\n    I would like to sketch briefly the turbulent events of the\r\nfollowing three years with some extracts from my diaries.\r\n\r\n    One year earlier, in 1940, following the invasion of Greece by the\r\nItalian army operating from Albania, the broadcasting authority in\r\nAthens (ETHNIKON IDRIMA RADIOFONIAS) began a news service in English\r\nwhich was beamed to England and the U.S.A.  on the short waves. In my\r\ncapacity as a member of the Press Department staff of the British\r\nEmbassy I took part in the first programme, and in fact read the first\r\nnews bulletin, which went out at 3 a.m.  Athens time.  As I said\r\nabove, early in April I was transferred to the British Embassy in\r\nCairo, Egypt.\r\n\r\n     1941: Very small contingents of the British army landed in Greece\r\nto help the Greek army.  But they proved totally incapable of standing\r\nup to the onslaught of the German army which followed soon after.  The\r\nGreek army laid down its arms in Epirus (north-western Greece).\r\nGeneral Tsolakoglou became the first 'Quisling' Prime Minister of\r\nGreece.  King George and his government, under Premier Emmanouil\r\nTsouderos had left for Cairo.\r\n\r\n    1942: In North Africa General Rommel had advanced to within 100\r\nmiles of Cairo, but his supply lines had become very long.  One of the\r\nmost important was the railway link through Greece, so the British\r\nstrategists decided that attempts must be made to disrupt it.  The\r\nSpecial Operations Executive (S.O.E.) in London, despatched two small\r\ngroups of saboteurs (about a dozen men altogether) under the command\r\nof Brigadier Eddie Myers and Major Chris Woodhouse who had the task of\r\nlinking up with the various bands of 'Andartes' (Resistance movement\r\nfighters) which had started forming in the mountains.\r\n\r\n    Unfortunately, the British officers were told nothing at all about\r\nthe bitter rivalries between the various groups, most probably because\r\nH.Q. in Cairo were themselves ignorant about the real situation.  It\r\ndidn't take Meyers and Woodhouse long to discover that by far the\r\nlargest group was E.L.A.S.  (the Popular Liberation Army) under Aris\r\nVelouhiotis, about 120 ill-equipped men operating in the Pindus\r\nmountains.  Another smaller group of about 60 men had rallied round a\r\nregular officer of the Greek army, Colonel Napoleon Zervas. They\r\ncalled themselves the National Republican Greek League (Greek initials\r\nE.D.E.S.)\r\n\r\n    I met Zervas personally years later when he was Minister of the\r\nInterior (and therefore responsible for the Police).  I was then\r\nacting as interpreter for the Assistant-Head of the British Police\r\nMission to Greece.  I remember vividly with what relish he described\r\nto Colonel Prosser his method of torturing E.L.A.S.  prisoners, which\r\nleft no physical marks on any part of the body.\r\n\r\n     It was in the course of a secret visit to Athens that young Chris\r\nWoodhouse found out the real chain of command, when he was introduced\r\nto George Siantos, the Secretary of the Greek Communist Party (Greek\r\ninitials K.K.E.).  The K.K.E.  controlled E.A.M., the National\r\nLiberation Front which, in turn, ran E.L.A.S.  But with a title like\r\nthat (National Liberation Front) it was easy to see why E.A.M.\r\nenjoyed such widespread support, not only in the countryside, but also\r\namong the intelligentsia in Athens.\r\n\r\n    But the task of the S.O.E. officers was made very difficult for\r\nvarious reasons: Winston Churchill had given orders that they were to\r\nsupport, as far as possible, only those guerrilla leaders who favoured\r\nthe King--but there were none, or very few.  The S.O.E.  units had\r\norders to cause the maximum disruption to the German occupation of the\r\ncountry.  And that was impossible without the support of E.L.A.S.,\r\nwhich was controlled by the Communists.  At the outset, it became\r\nobvious to the S.O.E.  officers that military and political priorities\r\nwere already in conflict.\r\n\r\n    E.L.A.S. forces were getting stronger every day and very soon they\r\nbegan attacking fellow Greeks in non-communist Andarte units.  The\r\nsuccessful attack on the railway bridge over the Gorgopotamos river on\r\nthe 26th of November was the first and last time that ELAS and EDES\r\nco-operated against the common enemy under the coercion and technical\r\nguidance of the British.\r\n\r\n    1943: Friction between EDES and ELAS continued to increase.  When\r\nEddie Myers told them that he had been instructed to destroy the\r\nbridge over the Asopos river, ELAS said it was too dangerous a target\r\nand refused to help, so this became an all-British operation.  A\r\n24-year-old demolition expert of the Royal Engineers Captain Ken\r\nScott, was sent from Cairo. He was dropped by parachute, and planned\r\nthe successful attack on the bridge. It took the Germans four months\r\nto rebuild it.\r\n\r\n    On the 11th of September 14,000 Italian troops in the north-west\r\nsurrendered to the Andartes with all their arms.  A month later ELAS\r\nseized the weapons and attacked EDES.  The civil war had begun.\r\n\r\n    1944: The friction between the various groups of the Resistance\r\nmovement erupted into full-scale war, described as the 'civil war' or\r\nthe 'guerrilla war' depending on whose side you were on. ELAS were\r\ndetermined that they alone would be in control when the Allies\r\narrived.  As a result of intense negotiations on the part of the\r\nBritish officers, all the Andarte leaders signed an Armistice document\r\non the 29th February 1944 agreeing to stop fighting each other and to\r\nconcentrate all their efforts against the common enemy--the Germans.\r\nUnfortunately, barely a month later ELAS attacked and completely\r\nannihilated the smallest andarte group E.K.K.A.  Now only EDES and the\r\n200-strong S.O.E. force stood between the 40,000 ELAS Communists and\r\ntotal control of the Greek countryside.\r\n\r\n   In the Middle East, the Lebanon Conference, attended by delegates\r\nfrom all parties, including representatives of the Andartes, elected\r\nGeorge Papandreou (father of Andreas Papandreou, recently Prime\r\nMinister of Greece), to act as Prime Minister of the Government of\r\nNational Unity in exile.  In September the government moved\r\ntemporarily to Italy. In October, following the withdrawal of the\r\nGermans from Athens, British troops began landing in Greece from Greek\r\nand British warships.  By far the largest contingent landed near the\r\nport of Piraeus and tens of thousands of Greeks turned out to cheer\r\nand welcome the British forces as they marched through the streets.\r\n\r\n    On October 18 the members of the Greek government returned to\r\nAthens under the leadership of the Premier George Papandreou, who was\r\naccompanied by Lt. General Ronald Scobie, the Allied military\r\ncommander.\r\n\r\n    Sadly though, in December ELAS marched on Athens. The British\r\ntroops, so recently feted and garlanded now found themselves fighting\r\non the same streets of their earlier welcome.  S.O.E. had been warning\r\nCairo for two years that this might happen.  After three or four weeks\r\nof intense fighting in the streets of Athens and in the suburbs, ELAS\r\nwithdrew.\r\n\r\n    Winston Churchill came to Athens on Christmas Day to mediate.  A\r\ncouple of ELAS snipers hiding in a school a few hundred yards away\r\nfrom the British Embassy took a few pot shots at him as he got out of\r\nan armoured vehicle which had brought him from the airport. Next day,\r\nwhen he attended a meeting of all parties, the ELAS representative\r\nwalked in wearing a military-style uniform with crossed bandoleers\r\nacross his chest, and carrying two pistols. Churchill turned to his\r\ninterpreter and said quietly: \"Tell him to leave his toys outside, or\r\nI fly back to London immediately, to spend Christmas properly with my\r\nfamily.\"\r\n\r\n    1945: On the 1st of January Archbishop Damaskinos was appointed\r\nRegent.  (It had been agreed that the King should not return to Greece\r\nuntil his position had been clarified by a plebiscite). Plastiras\r\nreplaced Papandreou as Prime Minister.  After the Varkiza agreement\r\nthe guerrilla war (or civil war) was officially brought to an end.\r\n\r\n    Years later in a broadcast, Chris Woodhouse summarised what the\r\nS.O.E. mission to Greece had achieved.\r\n\r\n         1.  It had provided the technical expertise, such as the\r\nhandling of explosives, without which the major sabotage successes\r\nwould have been impossible.\r\n\r\n         2.  It had provided the tactical planning and supplied the\r\ncommunications which successfully harnessed the courage of the Greeks\r\nto the strategic requirements of the Allied commanders.\r\n\r\n         3.  Most important of all, in the long run, it assured that\r\nno armed force in occupied Greece would gain a monopoly of power on\r\nthe day of liberation.  The final aim of the mission was to leave the\r\nGreeks with a free choice at the end of the war--a choice between a\r\nMonarchy, a Republic or even a Communist regime if they wanted it.\r\nBut the recent dramatic events in the closing months of 1989 in\r\nPoland, the U.S.S.R., Hungary, the East German Democratic Republic,\r\nCzechoslovakia and finally Romania have proved that the last choice\r\nwould have been an unwise one if the Greeks had also opted for\r\nCommunism.\r\n\r\n    1946: Following a plebiscite King George II returned to Greece at\r\nthe end of September and appointed Panayis Tsaldaris as his Prime\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n    When I returned to Athens in October 1944 on H.H.M.S.  AVEROF I\r\nhad been appointed Radio Monitoring Officer of the Anglo-Greek\r\nInformation Service (A.G.I.S.) with a staff of about 25 W/T operators\r\nand typists to assist me.  My unit was a section of the Press\r\nDepartment of the British Embassy.  I think the choice of title was a\r\nrather unfortunate mistake. The English words 'information' and\r\n'intelligence' have only one equivalent word in Greek pliroforiesq.\r\nAnd most Greeks hold peculiar views about the C.I.A.  and the British\r\nIntelligence Service.  So here I was strutting about in the uniform of\r\na war correspondent bearing the flashes 'I.S.', the butt of many a\r\njoke from my friends who accused me of being a master spy.  My boss,\r\nColonel Johnson, who had been the British Council representative in\r\nGreece prior to the outbreak of war in 1939, came to my office one\r\nmorning and told me that he had heard a rumour that King George of the\r\nHellenes, who was then in London, was going to broadcast in the Greek\r\nservice of the B.B.C.  I replied I had heard nothing, but would try\r\nand find out if the rumour was true.  As he left my office I glanced\r\nat my watch; it was 11 o'clock in the morning, 9 o'clock in London. I\r\ntelephoned the General Manager of Cable & Wireless, Mr Briggs, who was\r\na personal friend.  I told him I wanted to make use of his facilities\r\nto ask an urgent question of the B.B.C.  in London. He replied, \"Tell\r\nMcTaggert\" (the engineer in charge of the Central Telegraph Office)\r\n\"that I said he should help you in any way possible.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Mac,\" I said over the telephone, \"would you get one of your\r\noperators to ring the B.B.C.  in Bush House (from where the World\r\nService originates) and ask them if they have any plans for a\r\nbroadcast by King George of the Hellenes.\"  I immediately tuned one of\r\nmy receivers to the frequency of the London telegraph link, which was\r\ncarrying high speed morse traffic.  In a short while the tape was\r\nstopped and an operator, using a hand key, asked my question slowly in\r\nplain language, and then the tape was put on again. I waited anxiously\r\nfor about five minutes.  Again the tape was stopped, a single letter\r\n'R' (for received) was sent by hand, and traffic returned to\r\nnormal.  My telephone rang; it was McTaggert.  \"Nothing doing, old\r\nboy.  The B.B.C. have no plans for such a broadcast.\" I thanked him\r\nand looked at my watch.  It was 11.25, just 25 minutes had elapsed.  I\r\ncalled my boss and told him the answer to his question. \"How do you\r\nknow?\" he asked.  \"I asked the B.B.C., sir.\"  \"You what?\" he shouted\r\nat me. \"Don't you know there's a war on?  I'm coming to see you.\"  He\r\nstormed into my office and demanded an explanation, so I told him what\r\nI had done.  \"Good God, what is this going to cost us?\".  \"Nothing at\r\nall, sir.  There is no provision for anything like that in the\r\noperating procedure\".  \"Then I must write a letter to Cable & Wireless\r\nto thank them.\"  I thought to myself, why don't you write a letter to\r\nNorman and thank him for having friends in the right places.  But I\r\nkept my mouth shut.\r\n\r\n    My equipment and my staff of 20 men and 5 girls were housed on the\r\n6th floor of the Metohikon Tamion building.  When ELAS marched on\r\nAthens, there was constant firing, shelling and bombing throughout the\r\n24 hours of the day and night for three or four weeks. The bombing was\r\nby light aircraft of the R.A.F. on the ELAS positions in the suburbs\r\nand Beaufighter aircraft straffing them with 20 mm cannon. Then ELAS\r\nset up a 75 mm gun in the northern suburb of Aharnon, and started\r\nhitting us back.  When we had received several hits on and around our\r\nH.Q.  building, I was ordered to move down to the second floor, to\r\nsafer accommodation. I extended some of my antenna down-leads, and\r\nresumed normal service. One of our assignments was to transcribe,\r\nevery day, what was said in the Greek transmissions of nineteen\r\ndifferent countries about the situation in Greece, and to produce a\r\ndaily summary in English, for the benefit of the Press Department.\r\n\r\n    In the summer of 1945 we began having interference on GIN, a\r\nstation of the British Post Office which operated around 10MHz,\r\ntransmitting a REUTER news service for Europe on the German\r\nHellschreiber (Hell printer) system.  This was a sort of very course\r\nTV picture of 49 dots, seven by seven. The letter 'I' for instance\r\ncame out as seven dots vertically, and the letter 'T' just had another\r\nsix dots across the top.  The letters were very crude but readable,\r\nprovided there was no interference, or crashes of static.  The\r\ninterference, which made our tape quite unreadable, used to start\r\naround 3 in the afternoon and fade slowly away about three hours\r\nlater, when the tape became readable again.  I decided I would try and\r\nidentify the source.  All I had in the way of recorders were\r\noffice-type Dictaphones using wax cylinders.  I removed the three\r\nweights from the speed governor, and the cylinder spun round like mad.\r\nI managed to record for about three minutes and when I played the\r\nrecording on another machine at normal speed the cylinder yielded up\r\nits secret--it was high speed morse traffic in 5-figure cypher.  I\r\ntyped it all out and noticed that some of the paragraphs began with\r\nthe letter 'B'.  I subsequently found out it was a\r\ncharacteristic of stations carrying Royal Air Force traffic.  I sent\r\nmy text to London, and three weeks later the interference stopped.  It\r\nwas more than a month later that I was told what had happened.  The\r\ntransmitter causing the problem was located in Kandy, Ceylon.  It\r\noperated with a rhombic antenna beamed to R.A.F. Calcutta. Its\r\nfrequency was only 500 Hz away from GIN. The department which had\r\nallocated the frequency never imagined that it could possibly cause\r\ninterference in Europe to the REUTER news service.  But sunspot cycle\r\n20, which was a good one, had decided otherwise.\r\n\r\n    In 1947 I was transferred to the British Police Mission to Greece,\r\nwhich was headed by Sir Charles Wickham.  My principal duty was to\r\ninterpret for Sir Charles, and for his second in command Colonel\r\nProsser. My friend Mr Eleftheriou at the Ministry issued me with a\r\nspecial licence and I came on the air again using my pre-war callsign\r\nSV1RX.  When the Police Mission closed down in 1948 I came to England\r\nand got the callsign G3FNJ which I have now held for over 41 years.\r\n\r\n8. Wartime Broadcasts from Cairo.\r\n\r\n    Elias Eliascos, a former teacher of English at Athens College (a\r\njoint U.S./Greek institution) described to me how he came to be a\r\nnews-reader at Radio Cairo in 1941 together with his brother\r\nPatroclos.\r\n\r\n    \"When Hitler declared war on Greece and after the collapse of the\r\nfront in northern Greece and in Albania, my brother Patroclos and I\r\nwere summoned to the British Embassy in Athens and told that owing to\r\nour close ties with the British Council (of Cultural Relations), it\r\nwould not be prudent for us to remain in Athens or even Greece after\r\nthe German army had occupied the capital.  We were told that we would\r\nbe helped to leave Greece together with the British Embassy staff, the\r\nstaff of the British Council and all the British nationals in Greece.\r\n\r\n    \"The British Consul-General provided us with the necessary\r\ndocuments for my brother and me to board the last evacuation vessel\r\nsailing from the port of Piraeus.  It was the s/s 'Corinthia' which\r\nleft Piraeus on the 18th of April 1941.  It happened to be Good Friday\r\naccording to the Greek-Orthodox calendar. About five days later\r\nHitler's army marched into Athens.\r\n\r\n    \"The ship was packed and the British Embassy staff carried most of\r\nthe Embassy files with them.  One of the passengers was David Balfour\r\nwho was the vicar of the little chapel attached to the Evangelismos\r\nHospital, an impressive tall figure of a man sporting a large black\r\nbeard.  Although he had been ordained as a priest of the\r\nGreek-Orthodox Church he was a British national and it was widely\r\nrumoured that he was an agent of British Intelligence.  His official\r\ntitle was 'Father Dimitrios'.  He was also the spiritual father of the\r\nGreek Royal family.  I refer to David Balfour because recently the\r\n'ATHENIAN' which is the only English language magazine in Athens, in\r\nits issue dated January 1988, published a feature article about him,\r\nsaying that even before the Germans had entered Athens he had shaved\r\noff his beard and divested himself of his clerical robes.\r\n\r\n    \"I can say quite categorically that this was not true.  When the\r\n'Corinthia' sailed he was still 'Father Dimitrios' and in fact he\r\nofficiated at a Resurrection service while we were still at sea.  On\r\nthe voyage we carried out lifeboat drill on two occasions, once when\r\nit was thought that there was a U-boat in the vicinity, and another\r\ntime when an aircraft flew overhead which turned out to be friendly.\r\nI shall never forget how I was moved with emotion when I saw the women\r\ngetting into the boats, most of them carrying babies or children in\r\ntheir arms, calmly singing hymns in low voices.\r\n\r\n    \"Some time later I met David Balfour again in Cairo, and this time\r\nhe HAD shaved off his beard, and he was wearing the uniform of a Major\r\nin the Intelligence Corps which is a regular unit of the British\r\narmy.\"\r\n\r\n    Eliascos said he would like to quote a little more from the\r\nsensational article written by J.M. Thursby in the 'ATHENIAN'.\r\n\r\n    \"Several years before war was even declared, the Abwehr (German\r\nmilitary intelligence), along with the Nazi civilian secret service,\r\nhad highly trained undercover agents operating in Greece.  With\r\nconsummate skill they had catalogued all military and civil\r\ninformation that could be useful to the Third Reich, and organised spy\r\nrings throughout the country.  As war became more and more inevitable,\r\nit also became increasingly imperative that Britain and other\r\nanti-fascist countries should gain specific and accurate knowledge of\r\nthese operations.\r\n\r\n   \"During this period a monk, who had embraced the Orthodox faith in\r\nWarsaw, arrived from Poland via Mount Athos, to join the monastery of\r\nPendeli, just outside Athens.  According to his biographer John\r\nFreeman, his registration at Pendeli reads,\r\n\r\n         Cell 102  Serial number 75\r\n         Secular name David Balfour\r\n         Ecclesiastic name Dimitri\r\n         Place of birth England\r\n         Age 35\r\n         Inscribed  order  of  His  Holiness  the  Archbishop  of\r\n         Athens.\r\n         Coming from the Russian Church.\r\n         Archbishopric ordinance number 3197 of 9 May 1936.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Father Dimitri was obviously a well-educated and very courteous\r\nperson.  He had studied in various parts of Europe and spoke several\r\nlanguages fluently.  These included ancient, Byzantine and modern\r\nGreek, not to mention colloquial 'mangika' (slang). When a vacancy\r\narose for a priest to serve the chapel at Evangelismos Hospital in\r\ncentral Athens, who should be more suitable for this post in the heart\r\nof the select neighbourhood of Kolonaki than the well-educated,\r\nwell-bred, charming and conscientious Father Dimitri.\"\r\n\r\n   (David Balfour died aged 86 on the 11th of October 1989.)\r\n\r\n    \"Anyway, let me continue my story of the 'Corinthia trip\",\r\nEliascos went on.  \"We celebrated Easter on board and when we arrived\r\nat Alexandria some of us were sent on to Cairo and others went to\r\nIndia.  My brother and I presented ourselves at the offices of the\r\nPress Department of the British Embassy in the Garden City. We were\r\nreceived by the well-known Byzantine scholar Stephen Runciman who was\r\nin charge of all foreign language broadcasts directed to Europe, that\r\nis, the Balkans, Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Poland and\r\nseveral others. One of our colleagues was Lawrence Durrell who later\r\nbecame the famous author of many successful books like the banned\r\n'Black Book', 'Bitter Lemons', 'The Alexandria Quartet', 'Prospero's\r\nCell' and others.  But at that time, he used to entertain us daily\r\nwith a fresh episode about his Aunt Agatha with the wooden leg.\"\r\n\r\n    Eliascos continued: \"My brother Patroclos and I were told that we\r\nwould be attached to the section producing the broadcasts in Greek\r\ndirected towards occupied Greece, acting as translators, editors and\r\nnewsreaders.  The Head of this section was George Haniotis the sports\r\neditor of the Athens newspaper 'Elefthero Vima' who used to sign his\r\nsporting articles 'GEO'. Under him was the well-known literary figure\r\nof Dimitri Fotiadis, who died in October 1988.\r\n\r\n    \"When the broadcasts began early in May 1941 I was the principal\r\nnewsreader. Later when Haniotis was posted to the Greek Embassy in\r\nWashington D.C.  as Press Attache, my brother was appointed Section\r\nHead.  At that time the Prime Minister of the Greek government in\r\nexile was Emmanouil Tsouderos, a former Director of the Bank of\r\nGreece.  The foreign language broadcasts from Radio Cairo were under\r\nthe over-all control of the Political Warfare Executive (P.W.E.) of\r\nthe British Ministry of Information.  Later, in conjunction with the\r\nAmericans, the title of the unit was changed to Psychological Warfare\r\nBranch (P.W.B.)\r\n\r\n    \"Every evening we had two broadcasts, at 7.30 and 10.30 pm, which\r\nwent out on the medium wave transmitter of Radio Cairo at Abu Zabal,\r\nrun by the E.S.B. (Egyptian State Broadcasting).  The transmissions in\r\neleven foreign languages were also relayed by three short wave\r\ntransmitters, two belonging to the telegraph company Cable & Wireless\r\n(callsigns SUV & SUW), and an experimental transmitter of 7.5\r\nkilowatts belonging to a British army signals unit, with the odd\r\ncallsign JCJC, operated by young corporal Rowley Shears G8KW, a radio\r\namateur friend of Norman Joly.\r\n\r\n    \"The Greek broadcasts began in May 1941 and went on to the end of\r\nJanuary 1945.\r\n\r\n    \"During this period many important personalities broadcast from\r\nStudio 3, which was also used by well-known war correspondents of the\r\nB.B.C., the N.B.C.  and many other news organisations.  The people of\r\noccupied Greece were addressed by Mr Tsouderos, Crown Prince Paul of\r\nGreece, Sofoclis Venizelos, son of the famous Cretan politician\r\nEleftherios Venizelos who had played a leading role in the political\r\nfortunes of modern Greece, and Panayiotis Kanellopoulos Minister for\r\nWar.  After the naval mutiny in the port of Alexandria Admiral\r\nVoulgaris spoke to the officers and naval ratings of the Greek Royal\r\nNavy.\"\r\n\r\n    Eliascos described in detail the negotiations of the Lebanon\r\nConference which resulted in the appointment of George Papandreou\r\n(father of Andreas Papandreou who was recently Prime Minister), as the\r\nnew Prime Minister of the Coalition government in exile.  He can be\r\nseen at the famous R.C.A velocity microphone type 44BX which was used\r\nthroughout World War II and many years after. This ribbon type\r\nmicrophone had a very large and heavy permanent magnet embodied in the\r\ndesign and must have weighed about 1,000 times more than a modern\r\nelectret lapel microphone.\r\n\r\n    \"I must explain that these war-time broadcasts were carried out in\r\nthe presence of a Switch Censor who sat on the other side of the news\r\nreader's desk and was able to turn off the microphone in a split\r\nsecond if it ever became necessary.  During the three and a half years\r\nof the broadcasts this was done only on one special occasion and\r\ncertainly not because the newsreader had gone berserk or something like\r\nthat.  The Chief Censor was Professor Eric Sloman who had been the\r\nfirst Director of the Police Academy in Kerkyra (Corfu).  Then there\r\nwere censors for the eleven languages used in these broadcasts. The\r\ncensor for the Polish broadcasts was the Countess Walevska,\r\ngrand-daughter of Napoleon's lady friend. The Countess was a rather\r\nlarge lumbering woman who always came into the studio carrying lots of\r\nparcels.  One evening she came in and sat in an armchair on the other\r\nside of the studio to wait her turn for the Polish broadcast which\r\nfollowed the Greek. As I was reading the news bulletin I suddenly\r\nbecame conscious of a regular ticking noise in the headphones I was\r\nwearing.  I made a sign to Mr Joly who was acting as switch censor at\r\nthe time, and he got up and walked over to the Countess.  He whispered\r\nin her ear and asked her what was in her hand bag.  The Countess\r\nblushed and replied that she had just collected her alarm clock from\r\nthe watchmaker.  I don't know if any sharp-eared listener had heard\r\nthe ticking and thought that we had a time bomb in the studio.\r\n\r\n    \"Having mentioned my good friend Mr Norman Joly I must record that\r\nhe was the technical supervisor for the foreign language broadcasts,\r\nhandling such things as wavelengths for the short wave relays,\r\ntraining the newsreaders (of whom there must have been over 30) and\r\nacting as studio manager and switch censor for some of the languages\r\nwhich he knew.\r\n\r\n    \"A regular broadcaster in our studio was Francis Noel-Baker who\r\nlater became a Labour member of Parliament in the British House of\r\nCommons, like his father.  The Noel-Baker family are well-known in\r\nGreece because for several generations they have owned a large\r\nproperty on the island of Euboea (Evia in Greek).  Francis speaks\r\nfluent Greek, and his mother was related to Lord Byron.  In recent\r\nyears he has switched his allegiance to the Conservative Party led by\r\nhis personal friend Margaret Thatcher.\r\n\r\n    \"Major Patrick Leigh-Fermor the writer who had kidnapped\r\nMajor-General Heinrich Kreipe in Crete and spirited him away to Allied\r\nheadquarters in Cairo, came to our studio and described how this\r\naudacious operation had been carried out by him and Captain William\r\nStanley Moss, ex-Coldstream Guards, with the considerable assistance\r\nof the Cretan resistance movement partisans.\r\n\r\n    \"Purely by coincidence, it was the Greek news bulletin from Cairo\r\nwhich first announced to the world General Montgomery's victory over\r\nGeneral Rommel at Alamein.  I must explain that during a broadcast the\r\ntwo doors leading into the studio were kept closed and an armed\r\nofficer of the Military Police sat outside (in civilian clothes) to\r\nprevent anyone from entering for any reason whatsoever.  I was in the\r\nmiddle of reading the news when suddenly, without warning, the inner\r\ndoor opened and a young despatch-rider, still wearing his crash\r\nhelmet, walked in waving a piece of paper. Mr Joly immediately\r\nswitched off the microphone and asked the young man what he thought he\r\nwas doing.  'Most Immediate sir', he said.  (This is the army's\r\nhighest priority classification.) 'To be broadcast at once.'\r\n\r\n   \"Mr Joly handed the document to me and I saw it was written in\r\nEnglish.  Taking a deep breath I began translating the text into\r\nGreek, with some excitement and trepidation owing to the difference in\r\nsyntax between the two languages.  Forty-six years later Mr Joly gave\r\nme the identical sheet of paper, which he had kept as a souvenir.  It\r\nis printed here in full. At the Editorial offices, where they were\r\nmonitoring the newscast, they thought I had gone out of my mind,\r\nbecause the communique had not reached them yet.  When they tuned in\r\nto the short wave service of the B.B.C. they heard the communique read\r\nout more than an hour after our Greek broadcast.  A world scoop, if\r\never there was one. Years later when I returned to Athens, many of my\r\nfriends told me they had heard the first broadcast of the thrilling\r\nbulletin and they could still remember the excitement in my voice.\r\n\r\n    \"The Greek section was the first to inaugurate the transmission of\r\npersonal messages.  Many people were escaping from occupied Greece in\r\nsailing boats across to the shores of Asia Minor, ending up in the\r\nMiddle East, mostly in Cairo. They had no means of advising their\r\nrelatives and friends in Greece that they had survived the perilous\r\njourney.  We used to broadcast pre-arranged messages like 'John\r\ninforms Mary that he has arrived at the village'.\r\n\r\n    \"As I mentioned above, George Papandreou came to our studio and\r\nspoke to the people in Greece about the formation of the government of\r\nNational Unity, which had been agreed by all parties meeting in the\r\nLebanon, including the representatives of the Partisans operating in\r\nthe mountains of Greece.  Papandreou and the government in exile moved\r\nto Naples in Italy for a short period and then returned to Athens on\r\nOctober 12th 1944 for the Liberation.\r\n\r\n    \"Finally, I would like to say that in the dark days before\r\nMontgomery's breakthrough at Alamein, when it was quite on the cards\r\nthat General Rommel might take Cairo, Mr Joly and I were sent to\r\nJerusalem to make arrangements for the foreign language broadcasts to\r\nbe continued from there.  Fortunately the situation changed and we\r\nwere recalled to Cairo, where we arrived just in time for me to\r\nbroadcast the historic communique announcing the victory at Alamein,\r\nwhich marked the turning point of the war in the Middle East.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER NINE\r\n\r\n                            MISCELLANY\r\n\r\n1.  The first broadcasting stations of the world.\r\n\r\n     Speech was first transmitted for reception by the general public\r\nfrom Washington D.C. in 1915 when Europe was still at war. During\r\n1916 the first 'broadcasting' station in the world began regular\r\ntransmissions from a New York suburb.\r\n\r\n     In 1919 Dr. Frank Conrad, then Assistant Chief Engineer of the\r\nWestinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company, set up, in his own\r\ngarage in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, a 75-watt transmitter (8XK) from\r\nwhich he broadcast musical entertainment for other radio enthusiasts.\r\nThis was the first continued scheduled broadcasting in history.  The\r\nWestinghouse Company realised the potential value of Conrad's work and\r\nbuilt KDKA, the first regular commercial broadcasting station in the\r\nworld, which began its career by announcing the results of the\r\nHarding-Cox election returns on the November 2nd 1920.\r\n\r\n     The first broadcasting station in Europe was PCGG which began\r\ntransmitting on November 6th 1919 from the Hague in Holland.  Hanso\r\nSteringa Idzerda, a 35 year old engineer, obtained the first licence\r\ngranted in Europe for the transmission of music and speech for general\r\nreception, as opposed to the wireless telegraphy stations which had\r\nbeen operating point to point services.  From the end of 1919 to 1924\r\nthis station transmitted a series of musical programmes three times a\r\nweek called 'The Hague Concerts'.  The original wavelength of\r\n670 metres was later changed to 1,150 metres.\r\n\r\n     At that time most of the people who heard these concerts would\r\nhave been using headphones and they would not have been very critical\r\nabout the quality of the sounds they were hearing compared to the\r\nmagical novelty of snatching voices and music apparently out of thin\r\nair.  This historic transmitter can be seen in the museum of the Dutch\r\nPostal Services in the Hague.\r\n\r\n     The first transmissions of speech and music in England were made\r\nfrom Chelmsford, Essex, when a 15kW transmitter of the Marconi Company\r\nbegan regular transmissions in February of 1920.\r\n\r\n     In the summer of 1924 the world's greatest radio companies--British\r\nMarconi, German Telefunken, French Radio Telegraphie and\r\nAmerican R.C.A.--met in London to discuss transatlantic\r\ncommunications.  The learned gentlemen all agreed that the Atlantic\r\ncould only be spanned by ultra-long waves of 10,000 to 20,000 metres,\r\nwhich would require the use of hundreds of kilowatts of power and\r\nreceivers as large as a trunk, not to speak of antennas more than a\r\nmile long.  Dr.  Frank Conrad, who was also present at the conference,\r\nhad brought with him a small short wave receiver less than a foot\r\nsquare. When he connected it to a curtain rod as an antenna the faint\r\nbut clear voices of his assistants in the U.S.A. were heard from\r\nnearly four thousand miles away.  With this spectacular demonstration\r\nhe administered the deathblow to all plans for high power\r\nultra-long-wavelength transmitters, and from then on the commercial\r\ncompanies concentrated their efforts on developing equipment for\r\ninternational communications on the short waves.\r\n\r\n    With present-day electronic news gathering and world-wide\r\nsatellite links, the problems faced by broadcasting organisations\r\nfifty years ago when transmitting programmes which did not originate\r\nin a studio were thought to be very complex.  In the B.B.C.  Handbook\r\nfor 1928 there was an article entitled 'Outside Broadcast\r\nProblems' which said,\r\n\r\n     \"Work outside the studio is often the most difficult that the\r\nbroadcast engineer can be asked to undertake; not so much from a\r\ntechnical as from a practical point of view.  Very often he has to\r\ntake his apparatus to some place he has never seen before, set up his\r\namplifiers in most awkward positions, test his lines to the studio,\r\ndecide on his microphone placings and run out the wiring in the space\r\nof an hour or so, with little previous experience to guide him.  It is\r\nin fairly echoey halls, theatres and churches that the majority of\r\noutside broadcasts take place.  For example, a sermon preached in a\r\nchurch would be intelligible probably to the whole of the congregation.\r\nBut to render it intelligibly on a loud-speaker, the microphone would\r\nhave to be, say, not more than ten feet from the speaker.  In\r\nbroadcasting a play from a theatre, when the speakers are moving\r\nabout, the only way of dealing with the problem is to use several\r\nmicrophones and a mixing device which enables the engineer to change\r\nsilently from one microphone to another, or to combine them in varying\r\nproportions.  Some rapid switching may sometimes be necessary.\r\n\r\n     \"Even with good microphones and amplifiers the engineer in the\r\nfield may often experience difficulties with the lines connecting the\r\noutside point to the studio.  The majority of such lines do not\r\ntransmit the higher frequencies adequately, especially the longer\r\nones.  The problems become immense when European simultaneous\r\nbroadcasts are attempted.  Experiments on the continental wireless\r\nlink have done no more than reveal its unreliability.  The undersea\r\ntelephone line, however, does not give either good or even intelligible\r\nquality of speech if it is longer than a couple of hundred miles, and\r\nit is quite unusable for the transmission of a musical programme.\r\n\r\n     \"The B.B.C.  has been the first in the world to exploit\r\nSimultaneous Broadcasting to its fullest advantage for a national\r\nsystem, and thanks to the co-operation of the Post Office engineers,\r\nit is possible to pick up a programme wherever it may take place\r\nwithin the British Isles and radiate it simultaneously from all\r\ndistribution centres.\r\n\r\n     \"Looking ahead still further and assuming that the wireless will\r\nsupplement the wire line link, there is no reason why a simultaneous\r\nbroadcast of something of fundamental importance to the whole\r\ncivilised world should not take place some time in the future.\"\r\n\r\n     In a book entitled \"Radio Goes to War\" published by Faber & Faber\r\nin 1943, Charles J. Rolo wrote,\r\n\r\n     \"Radio went to war on five continents shortly after the Nazi\r\nParty came to power in Germany.  In nine years it has been streamlined\r\nfrom a crude propaganda bludgeon into the most powerful single\r\ninstrument of political warfare the world has ever known.  Spreading\r\nwith the speed of light, it carries the human voice seven times round\r\nthe globe in one second.  When Hitler makes a speech in the Kroll\r\nOpera House in Berlin, listeners in America and the whole world hear\r\nhis words by short wave even before his own immediate audience hears\r\nthem.  Radio speaks in all tongues to all classes.  All pervasive, it\r\npenetrates beyond national frontiers, spans the walls of censorship\r\nthat bar the way to the written word, and seeps through the fine net\r\nof the Gestapo.  It reaches the illiterate and the informed, the young\r\nand the old, the civilian and the soldier in the front line, the\r\npolicy makers and the inarticulate masses.  So great is the importance\r\nof radio to-day that the seizure of a defeated nation's transmitters\r\nhas become one of the primary spoils of war.\"\r\n\r\n     In Greece, broadcasting was started in the northern city of\r\nThessaloniki (Salonica) by the pioneer of Balkan broadcasting Christos\r\nTsingeridis, in 1928.  A museum in that city tells the full story of\r\nthe first broadcasting station in the whole of the Balkans.\r\n\r\n     Broadcasting in the capital, Athens, started on March 25th 1938\r\nwhen a second-hand 15 kW Telefunken transmitter was put into operation\r\nin the suburb of Liosia.  The centre-fed T antenna was supported\r\nbetween two pylons of 85 metres (279 feet).  In 1944 when the German\r\narmy was pulling out of Athens they tried to blow the the pylons up\r\nbut one of them remained standing at a crazy angle, because one of the\r\nexplosive charges had been placed incorrectly.\r\n\r\n2.  Avlis 'The Voice of Hellas'.\r\n\r\n     The 5th Programme of the Greek broadcasting service (Elliniki\r\nRadiophonia) is transmitted from the short wave transmitting centre at\r\nAvlis, about 70 kilometres north of Athens.  The station was put into\r\nservice in 1972 and has two 100KW Marconi short wave transmitters and\r\na veritable forest of antennas covering 1,100 acres, arranged in three\r\nlines to cover the desired directions, as can be seen on the great\r\ncircle map.  The pylons supporting the 6 MHz arrays are truly\r\nimpressive at 328 feet.  Each line has eight separate antennas for the\r\n6, 7, 9, 11, 15, 17 and 21 MHz broadcasting bands.\r\n\r\n     Each antenna consists of two curtains with a total of 8\r\nhorizontal dipoles.  The dipoles are all fed by open wire feeders\r\nwhich can be remotely switched to enable radiation in two directions\r\n180 degrees apart.  There are also three curtains for the 11 metre\r\nband (26 MHz) which may be put into service during sunspot cycle 22 if\r\nthe M.U.F.  allows it.\r\n\r\n     For transmissions to neighbouring countries like Cyprus, Turkey,\r\nthe Balkans and the countries of the Middle East, there are two\r\nrotatable log periodic antennas with a high angle of vertical\r\nradiation (45 degrees) and a wide angle of 32 degrees in the\r\nhorizontal plane.\r\n\r\n     The remotely controlled switching centre allows each of the two\r\ntransmitters to be connected to any one of the 23 antennas.\r\nElectromechanical protection circuits ensure that a transmitter can\r\nonly be connected to an antenna that is tuned to the same frequency.\r\nThe change of antennas and transmitting frequencies is made during the\r\nten-minute interval between programmes, which always begin on the\r\nhour, preceded by the now familiar signature tune of a shepherd\r\nplaying his flute with the tinkling of sheep-bells in the background,\r\nrecorded in 1936, followed by the Greek National Anthem.\r\n\r\n     The special programmes of news and features originate in the\r\nbroadcasting headquarters in Athens and go on the air throughout the\r\n24 hours of the day in Greek, English and many foreign languages.\r\nReports of reception are welcome and should be addressed to K.E.B.A.,\r\nAvlis, Greece.  (The Greek initials stand for short wave transmitting\r\ncentre.)\r\n\r\n     But Avlis was 'in the news' long before the Greek broadcasting\r\nservice decided to install its short wave transmitters there.  In\r\nancient times a great fleet of ships had been assembled in the harbour\r\nthere, ready to set sail for Troy, following the abduction of the\r\nbeautiful Helen of Sparta by Paris, the young Prince of Troy.  But\r\nthere had been no wind for many weeks, and the sea was dead calm.\r\n\r\n     Agamemnon, the King of Mycenae, who had himself contributed over\r\n100 ships to the fleet, decided to consult his Seer.  As was the\r\ncustom, the Seer slaughtered a young lamb and scrutinised its\r\nentrails.  He then announced that the wind would come up if Agamemnon\r\nsacrificed his daughter Iphigenia on the Altar of Sacrifice.  King\r\nAgamemnon despatched a messenger to Mycenae (no VHF repeater being\r\navailable in those days) to tell his wife Queen Klitemnestra to send\r\ntheir daughter Iphigenia to Avlis (Aulis).  The King said he was\r\nplanning to marry her off to Achilles, the most eligible bachelor of\r\nthe day.  When poor Iphigenia arrived she was quickly placed on the\r\nSacrificial Altar--and had her pretty throat slit.\r\n\r\n     However, there seems to be another version to the end of the\r\nstory.  Just before the human sacrifice was due to be made Artemis\r\n(Diana, the famous Goddess of Hunting) sent a small deer which was\r\nplaced on the altar instead of the girl.  Iphigenia was secretly\r\nspirited away to Taurida, in northern Greece, and put in charge of\r\nDiana's temple there.\r\n\r\n  (This story is the subject of a well-known classical Greek play.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHistorical note on the Marconi-Stille steel tape recording machine.\r\n\r\n     At the beginning of the century Professor Poulsen, one of radio's\r\nearliest pioneers, discovered that a magnetic impression could be made\r\non a moving length of wire which remained on the wire even after it\r\nhad been rolled up.  He used his machine to record the Morse code\r\nonly, that is magnetism 'on' and 'off'. In 1924 Dr. Stille in Germany\r\nmade a machine which could record sounds. The B.B.C. sent two\r\nengineers to Berlin, and after a demonstration they offered to buy the\r\nmachine, but in the end they returned to England empty-handed.\r\n\r\n     In 1931 Mr Louis Blattner managed to buy a machine and bring it\r\nto England.  He called it the Blattnerphone.  By this time Dr. Stille\r\nhad replaced Poulsen's wire with a flat steel tape 6 mm wide. Each\r\nreel of tape could only accommodate 20 minutes of recording. There was\r\na constant and heavy background hiss, due to the inherent quality of\r\nthe steel tape itself.\r\n\r\n     Stille Inventions Ltd.  joined forces with Marconi's Wireless\r\nTelegraph Co. Ltd. to produce, with the close co-operation of the\r\nB.B.C. Research Department, the Marconi-Stille machine which was put\r\ninto use in 1934. The tape width was reduced to 3 mm and the\r\nthickness to only 0.08 of a millimetre. In order to secure the\r\nreproduction of the higher audio frequencies, it was found necessary\r\nto run the tape at a rate of 90 metres per minute past the recording\r\nand reproducing heads. This meant that the length of tape required\r\nfor a half-hour's programme was nearly 3 kilometres!\r\n\r\n\r\n4.  Brief description of the ribbon or velocity microphone.\r\n\r\n   George Papandreou, Greek Prime Minister of the war-time government\r\nof National Unity in exile, is seen with the famous ribbon microphone\r\ndeveloped by the B.B.C. in 1934.  This microphone (R.C.A.\r\ndesignation 44BX) consists of a ribbon of corrugated aluminium foil\r\nonly 0.0002 of an inch thick suspended vertically in a very intense\r\nbut narrow magnetic field.  When sounds vibrate the ribbon extremely\r\nlow alternating voltages are developed at the ends of the ribbon,\r\nwhich has a very low impedance of only 0.15 ohm, necessitating the use\r\nof a step-up transformer of 1:45 turns ratio very close to it. The\r\nfrequency response is 20 to 16,000 Hz. A drawback is that the ribbon\r\ncan be blown out of the magnetic gap by sudden puffs of air when a\r\nspeaker gets too close to the microphone, so the casing is lined with\r\nseveral layers of chiffon which let in the sounds but not the air.\r\nWithout its base the ribbon microphone weighs 4 kilograms, nearly 9\r\nlbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. An outstanding antenna system designed by Rex G4JUJ for Phase III\r\namateur satellite communication.\r\n\r\n     The up-link section comprises four 88-element Jaybeam multi-beams\r\nwhich provide a power gain of 225.\r\n\r\n     The two down-link 8 element yagis are each fitted with a small\r\nD.C. motor directly coupled to a 9 inch length of M5 brass studding\r\nrotating inside a block of PTFE linked to a push rod which can move\r\nthe antennas 75 degrees both sides of the vertical position, either in\r\nunison or in opposite directions.  This system provides infinitely\r\nvariable polarisation which optimises the down-link signal at any\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. The saga of H.H.M.S. ADRIAS\r\n\r\n     While fighting in the area of the Dodecanese Islands on the night\r\nof the 22nd October 1943 the destroyer ADRIAS (L67) was seriously\r\ndamaged by a mine but refused to sink.\r\n\r\n     Under the command of Commander John Toumbas the ship covered a\r\ndistance of approximately 700 nautical miles, reaching the port of\r\nAlexandria in Egypt on the eve of the feast of Saint Nicholas, the\r\npatron saint of all seamen.\r\n\r\n     The Greek Minister of the Navy Sofoclis Venizelos, and the\r\nBritish Admiral in command of the Royal Navy in the Eastern\r\nMediterranean, provided an honorary escort for the brave little ship\r\nthat had refused to die.  A few months later the snub-nosed L67 joined\r\nthe fleet of 100 vessels of all sorts which sailed to Greece for the\r\nLiberation.\r\n\r\n     The photographs were taken by the author (with the exception of\r\nthe damaged L67) who travelled back to Greece on H.H.M.S. AVEROF in\r\nthe same convoy.  The photograph of L84, a similar type destroyer to\r\nADRIAS shows how much of her bows was blown off by the collision with\r\nthe mine.\r\n\r\n(H.H.M.S. stands for His Hellenic Majesty's Ship.)\r\n\r\n7. German sabotage at the Cable & Wireless station at Pallini, Greece,\r\nin World War II.\r\n\r\n     As the German army was pulling out of Greece in October 1944 its\r\nengineers carried out extensive sabotage to installations of a\r\nstrategic value.  At Pallini, not far from Athens, an attempt was made\r\nto destroy the transmitter hall by dropping one of the antenna towers\r\nonto it, but the equipment was not damaged.\r\n\r\n     They were more successful at the Royal Navy transmitting site at\r\nVotanikos.  Here they tried to destroy six 300 foot tubular masts.\r\nOne remained standing and also the lower part of another.  All the\r\ntest gear in the lab was thrown out of a second floor window and\r\nburnt.  I was acting as official photographer for my unit at the time.\r\nWhen I walked into a small store room I saw all the equipment had been\r\nthrown off the shelves on to the floor, but appeared to be intact.  I\r\nspotted a box of brand new packed German navy morse keys and decided\r\nthe time had come for me to acquire a small war trophy of my own.  As\r\nI bent down to pick up a key, I was horrified to see two large sticks\r\nof gelignite perched perilously on the edge of a shelf.  The explosive\r\nwas tied with white ribbon, with a weight attached to the other end.\r\nI froze to the spot.  Gingerly I lifted my trophy out of the box and\r\nbegan to walk slowly backwards, being very careful not to knock\r\nanything over.  I breathed a sigh of relief when I was out of the room\r\nand immediately alerted the engineers who came and defused the booby\r\ntrap.  So this book might never have been written thanks to the German\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n     At the Athens broadcasting station transmitter site at Liosia my\r\nunit erected a small temporary 'T' antenna which allowed the station\r\nto come on the air again, but a short time later, when the ELAS\r\nguerrillas overran the area they began using the transmitter to\r\nbroadcast their own view of events.  We provided the broadcasting\r\nauthority with a BC 610 mobile transmitter installed next to the\r\nParliament building in the centre of town, using the same frequency of\r\n610 KHz.  Listeners in Cairo couldn't understand what was going on\r\nwhen one moment they heard an official government announcement and a\r\nlittle later a war communique issued by the Communist guerrillas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Over-the-horizon or Ionospheric HF Radar--OTHR\r\n\r\n\r\n     As mentioned briefly in Chapter 1, it was in April 1976 that the\r\nthen Soviet Union first unleashed a diabolical noise on the HF bands\r\nwhich caused widespread interference to all broadcasting and\r\ntelecommunication services between 6 and 20 MHz. On the first day the\r\n\"knock-knock-knock\" went on continuously for over ten hours. Radio\r\namateurs, who were among the services that suffered from the\r\ninterference, soon came to call this noise \"the woodpecker\". By\r\nrotating their beams when tuned to the 14 MHz band they established\r\nthat the transmissions appeared to originate from the vicinity of the\r\ntown of Gomel in the U.S.S.R.\r\n\r\n     The governments of many countries world-wide immediately\r\nprotested to Moscow, and all they got in reply was a brief statement\r\nthat the U.S.S.R. was carrying out \"an experiment\".\r\n\r\n     The reason for the very strong on/off pulses was probably\r\nbecause, at first, the Russians were using existing radar antennas\r\nwhich permit the transmitting and receiving functions to share the\r\nsame antenna. Modern OTHR installations have different transmitting\r\nand receiving sites, often located many miles apart.\r\n\r\n     From the early 1950s pulsed oblique ionosphere sounders had shown\r\nthat the normal ionosphere is much more stable than had previously\r\nbeen thought to be.  The physical reason for this is that the\r\nincredibly tenuous ionized gas which does the reflecting has a\r\nmolasses-like viscosity.  Of course, there are daily and seasonal\r\nchanges, but over limited periods of half an hour or so, the F layer\r\nat a given location is actually quite well-behaved.  It bounces back\r\nsignals in a nearly constant direction and with nearly constant\r\namplitude--just what is required for good radar performance.\r\n\r\n     Over-the-horizon HF radars use the ionosphere as a kind of mirror\r\nto \"see\" around the curvature of the earth.  They have a variety of\r\nuses, both military and civilian.  And they have the advantage over\r\nline-of-sight microwave radars of being able to cover enormous areas\r\nwith much less power and at a fraction of the cost of the latter.\r\n\r\n     A \"relocatable\" OTHR system can track aircraft targets right down\r\nto ground level.  In an early experiment operators were puzzled by the\r\nsudden disappearance from their screen of an aircraft they had been\r\ntracking as it taxied along the ground.  They found out later that the\r\nreason for the disappearance was that the aircraft had gone into a\r\nmetal hangar which did not show on the screen because it was not in\r\nmotion, as explained below.\r\n\r\n     In 1979 the United States Air Force began experimenting with an\r\nOTHR system at a site near Bangor, Maine. Because HF frequencies were\r\nbeing used the power was kept very low to minimize interference to\r\nother services during the early tests.  At the time of writing (1989)\r\nit is believed that a full-power relocatable OTHR system situated in\r\nVirginia is being used in the anti-drug war.\r\n\r\n     As can be seen from the map this ROTHR can cover a vast area of\r\n1.6 million nautical miles, straddling the whole Caribbean.  The scan\r\narea stretches from the coast of Colombia in South America up through\r\nNicaragua and Honduras to Florida (on its west boundary) and then\r\nsouthwards through Puerto Rico, to Trinidad & Tobago and the northern\r\ncoast of Venezuela.\r\n\r\n     But this vast area is not covered continuously; the system\r\noperator can provide surveillance in a number of sectors known as DIRs\r\n(dwell information regions). Each one of the 176 DIRs can be\r\n\"illuminated\" for only a few seconds at a time. Small aircraft and\r\nsmall vessels can be detected by an ingenious method, only when they\r\nmove. This is how it is done:\r\n\r\n     At the receiving site of the ROTHR system a very large antenna\r\nstretches out over a distance of 8,400 feet. It consists of 372\r\ndual-monopole vertical elements each 19 feet high, backed by a huge\r\nreflector screen which makes the antenna substantially unidirectional.\r\nEach pair of vertical elements has its own receiver which digitizes\r\nthe incoming signals. All the digitized signals are then fed through a\r\nfibre-optic link to a master signal processor. The main receiver can\r\nbe programmed to pass on \"returns\" from one particular region while\r\neliminating most of the other returns as unwanted noise or clutter.\r\nBut because the wanted target is moving, while the clutter is not, a\r\nfiltering system based on the Doppler Shift principle (even when the\r\necho is only one or two Hertz different) will lock on to it and track\r\nit as long as it stays in motion.\r\n\r\n     Furthermore, the ROTHR system has its own built-in automatic\r\nmanagement & assessment function and does not have to depend on\r\nexternal sounding data. It measures the ionosphere height continuously\r\nand instantly selects the most appropriate frequency to use to scan\r\nthe target area, ideally in one hop.\r\n\r\n     This automatic function uses a quasi-vertical incidence sounder\r\n(QVI) to measure the height of the ionosphere near the transmitting\r\nand receiving sites, which as mentioned earlier can be miles apart,\r\nand a radar backscatter sounder to measure the height of the\r\nionosphere downrange 500 to 1,800 nautical miles away. The incoming\r\nreal-time data from these soundings are compared with data stored in\r\ncomputer memory. Once real-time data are matched to a model of the\r\nionosphere, the model can be used to operate the system for the best\r\nresults, based on the prevailing propagation conditions. The data for\r\nthe ionospheric models take up more than 200 megabytes of computer\r\nstorage space. Operators thus know when and where to expect degraded\r\nperformance. Of course, strong solar activity can virtually make\r\nover-the-horizon HF radar unusable.\r\n\r\n     A Spectrum Analyser display shows all the frequencies between 5\r\nand 28 MHz. In order to avoid possible interference to other services,\r\nthose frequencies which are known to be permanently allocated to fixed\r\nbroadcasting and telecommunication stations are locked out, as well as\r\nfrequencies which happen to be used at any instant so that they can\r\nalso be avoided by the OTHR transmitter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  GLOSSARY for non-technical readers.\r\n\r\n  A.M.
