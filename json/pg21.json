He thus addressed him: \"Sirrah, last year you\r\ngrossly insulted me.\" \"Indeed,\" bleated the Lamb in a mournful tone\r\nof voice, \"I was not then born.\" Then said the Wolf, \"You feed in my\r\npasture.\" \"No, good sir,\" replied the Lamb, \"I have not yet tasted\r\ngrass.\" Again said the Wolf, \"You drink of my well.\" \"No,\" exclaimed the\r\nLamb, \"I never yet drank water, for as yet my mother's milk is both food\r\nand drink to me.\" Upon which the Wolf seized him and ate him up, saying,\r\n\"Well! I won't remain supperless, even though you refute every one of my\r\nimputations.\" The tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bat And The Weasels\r\n\r\nA BAT who fell upon the ground and was caught by a Weasel pleaded to be\r\nspared his life. The Weasel refused, saying that he was by nature the\r\nenemy of all birds. The Bat assured him that he was not a bird, but a\r\nmouse, and thus was set free. Shortly afterwards the Bat again fell to\r\nthe ground and was caught by another Weasel, whom he likewise entreated\r\nnot to eat him. The Weasel said that he had a special hostility to\r\nmice. The Bat assured him that he was not a mouse, but a bat, and thus a\r\nsecond time escaped.\r\n\r\nIt is wise to turn circumstances to good account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ass And The Grasshopper\r\n\r\nAN ASS having heard some Grasshoppers chirping, was highly enchanted;\r\nand, desiring to possess the same charms of melody, demanded what sort\r\nof food they lived on to give them such beautiful voices. They replied,\r\n\"The dew.\" The Ass resolved that he would live only upon dew, and in a\r\nshort time died of hunger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion And The Mouse\r\n\r\nA LION was awakened from sleep by a Mouse running over his face. Rising\r\nup angrily, he caught him and was about to kill him, when the Mouse\r\npiteously entreated, saying: \"If you would only spare my life, I would\r\nbe sure to repay your kindness.\" The Lion laughed and let him go. It\r\nhappened shortly after this that the Lion was caught by some hunters,\r\nwho bound him by strong ropes to the ground. The Mouse, recognizing\r\nhis roar, came and gnawed the rope with his teeth, and set him free,\r\nexclaiming:\r\n\r\n\"You ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help you, not expecting\r\nto receive from me any repayment of your favor; now you know that it is\r\npossible for even a Mouse to confer benefits on a Lion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Charcoal-Burner And The Fuller\r\n\r\nA CHARCOAL-BURNER carried on his trade in his own house. One day he met\r\na friend, a Fuller, and entreated him to come and live with him, saying\r\nthat they should be far better neighbors and that their housekeeping\r\nexpenses would be lessened. The Fuller replied, \"The arrangement is\r\nimpossible as far as I am concerned, for whatever I should whiten, you\r\nwould immediately blacken again with your charcoal.\"\r\n\r\nLike will draw like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Father And His Sons\r\n\r\nA FATHER had a family of sons who were perpetually quarreling among\r\nthemselves. When he failed to heal their disputes by his exhortations,\r\nhe determined to give them a practical illustration of the evils of\r\ndisunion; and for this purpose he one day told them to bring him a\r\nbundle of sticks. When they had done so, he placed the faggot into the\r\nhands of each of them in succession, and ordered them to break it in\r\npieces. They tried with all their strength, and were not able to do it.\r\nHe next opened the faggot, took the sticks separately, one by one, and\r\nagain put them into his sons' hands, upon which they broke them easily.\r\nHe then addressed them in these words: \"My sons, if you are of one mind,\r\nand unite to assist each other, you will be as this faggot, uninjured\r\nby all the attempts of your enemies; but if you are divided among\r\nyourselves, you will be broken as easily as these sticks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Boy Hunting Locusts\r\n\r\nA BOY was hunting for locusts. He had caught a goodly number, when he\r\nsaw a Scorpion, and mistaking him for a locust, reached out his hand to\r\ntake him. The Scorpion, showing his sting, said: \"If you had but touched\r\nme, my friend, you would have lost me, and all your locusts too!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cock and the Jewel\r\n\r\nA COCK, scratching for food for himself and his hens, found a precious\r\nstone and exclaimed: \"If your owner had found thee, and not I, he would\r\nhave taken thee up, and have set thee in thy first estate; but I have\r\nfound thee for no purpose. I would rather have one barleycorn than all\r\nthe jewels in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kingdom of the Lion\r\n\r\nTHE BEASTS of the field and forest had a Lion as their king. He was\r\nneither wrathful, cruel, nor tyrannical, but just and gentle as a king\r\ncould be. During his reign he made a royal proclamation for a general\r\nassembly of all the birds and beasts, and drew up conditions for a\r\nuniversal league, in which the Wolf and the Lamb, the Panther and the\r\nKid, the Tiger and the Stag, the Dog and the Hare, should live together\r\nin perfect peace and amity. The Hare said, \"Oh, how I have longed to see\r\nthis day, in which the weak shall take their place with impunity by the\r\nside of the strong.\" And after the Hare said this, he ran for his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wolf and the Crane\r\n\r\nA WOLF who had a bone stuck in his throat hired a Crane, for a large\r\nsum, to put her head into his mouth and draw out the bone. When the\r\nCrane had extracted the bone and demanded the promised payment, the\r\nWolf, grinning and grinding his teeth, exclaimed: \"Why, you have surely\r\nalready had a sufficient recompense, in having been permitted to draw\r\nout your head in safety from the mouth and jaws of a wolf.\"\r\n\r\nIn serving the wicked, expect no reward, and be thankful if you escape\r\ninjury for your pains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fisherman Piping\r\n\r\nA FISHERMAN skilled in music took his flute and his nets to the\r\nseashore. Standing on a projecting rock, he played several tunes in the\r\nhope that the fish, attracted by his melody, would of their own accord\r\ndance into his net, which he had placed below. At last, having long\r\nwaited in vain, he laid aside his flute, and casting his net into the\r\nsea, made an excellent haul of fish. When he saw them leaping about in\r\nthe net upon the rock he said: \"O you most perverse creatures, when\r\nI piped you would not dance, but now that I have ceased you do so\r\nmerrily.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHercules and the Wagoner\r\n\r\nA CARTER was driving a wagon along a country lane, when the wheels sank\r\ndown deep into a rut. The rustic driver, stupefied and aghast, stood\r\nlooking at the wagon, and did nothing but utter loud cries to Hercules\r\nto come and help him. Hercules, it is said, appeared and thus addressed\r\nhim: \"Put your shoulders to the wheels, my man. Goad on your bullocks,\r\nand never more pray to me for help, until you have done your best to\r\nhelp yourself, or depend upon it you will henceforth pray in vain.\"\r\n\r\nSelf-help is the best help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ants and the Grasshopper\r\n\r\nTHE ANTS were spending a fine winter's day drying grain collected in\r\nthe summertime. A Grasshopper, perishing with famine, passed by and\r\nearnestly begged for a little food. The Ants inquired of him, \"Why did\r\nyou not treasure up food during the summer?\" He replied, \"I had not\r\nleisure enough. I passed the days in singing.\" They then said in\r\nderision: \"If you were foolish enough to sing all the summer, you must\r\ndance supperless to bed in the winter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Traveler and His Dog\r\n\r\nA TRAVELER about to set out on a journey saw his Dog stand at the\r\ndoor stretching himself. He asked him sharply: \"Why do you stand there\r\ngaping? Everything is ready but you, so come with me instantly.\" The\r\nDog, wagging his tail, replied: \"O, master! I am quite ready; it is you\r\nfor whom I am waiting.\"\r\n\r\nThe loiterer often blames delay on his more active friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dog and the Shadow\r\n\r\nA DOG, crossing a bridge over a stream with a piece of flesh in his\r\nmouth, saw his own shadow in the water and took it for that of another\r\nDog, with a piece of meat double his own in size. He immediately let go\r\nof his own, and fiercely attacked the other Dog to get his larger piece\r\nfrom him. He thus lost both: that which he grasped at in the water,\r\nbecause it was a shadow; and his own, because the stream swept it away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mole and His Mother\r\n\r\nA MOLE, a creature blind from birth, once said to his Mother: \"I am sure\r\nthan I can see, Mother!\" In the desire to prove to him his mistake, his\r\nMother placed before him a few grains of frankincense, and asked, \"What\r\nis it?\" The young Mole said, \"It is a pebble.\" His Mother exclaimed:\r\n\"My son, I am afraid that you are not only blind, but that you have lost\r\nyour sense of smell.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Herdsman and the Lost Bull\r\n\r\nA HERDSMAN tending his flock in a forest lost a Bull-calf from the fold.\r\nAfter a long and fruitless search, he made a vow that, if he could only\r\ndiscover the thief who had stolen the Calf, he would offer a lamb in\r\nsacrifice to Hermes, Pan, and the Guardian Deities of the forest. Not\r\nlong afterwards, as he ascended a small hillock, he saw at its foot a\r\nLion feeding on the Calf. Terrified at the sight, he lifted his eyes and\r\nhis hands to heaven, and said: \"Just now I vowed to offer a lamb to the\r\nGuardian Deities of the forest if I could only find out who had robbed\r\nme; but now that I have discovered the thief, I would willingly add a\r\nfull-grown Bull to the Calf I have lost, if I may only secure my own\r\nescape from him in safety.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hare and the Tortoise\r\n\r\nA HARE one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the Tortoise,\r\nwho replied, laughing: \"Though you be swift as the wind, I will beat you\r\nin a race.\" The Hare, believing her assertion to be simply impossible,\r\nassented to the proposal; and they agreed that the Fox should choose\r\nthe course and fix the goal. On the day appointed for the race the two\r\nstarted together. The Tortoise never for a moment stopped, but went on\r\nwith a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course. The Hare,\r\nlying down by the wayside, fell fast asleep. At last waking up, and\r\nmoving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise had reached the goal,\r\nand was comfortably dozing after her fatigue.\r\n\r\nSlow but steady wins the race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pomegranate, Apple-Tree, and Bramble\r\n\r\nTHE POMEGRANATE and Apple-Tree disputed as to which was the most\r\nbeautiful. When their strife was at its height, a Bramble from the\r\nneighboring hedge lifted up its voice, and said in a boastful tone:\r\n\"Pray, my dear friends, in my presence at least cease from such vain\r\ndisputings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Farmer and the Stork\r\n\r\nA FARMER placed nets on his newly-sown plowlands and caught a number\r\nof Cranes, which came to pick up his seed. With them he trapped a Stork\r\nthat had fractured his leg in the net and was earnestly beseeching the\r\nFarmer to spare his life. \"Pray save me, Master,\" he said, \"and let me\r\ngo free this once. My broken limb should excite your pity. Besides, I\r\nam no Crane, I am a Stork, a bird of excellent character; and see how I\r\nlove and slave for my father and mother. Look too, at my feathers--they\r\nare not the least like those of a Crane.\" The Farmer laughed aloud and\r\nsaid, \"It may be all as you say, I only know this: I have taken you with\r\nthese robbers, the Cranes, and you must die in their company.\"\r\n\r\nBirds of a feather flock together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Farmer and the Snake\r\n\r\nONE WINTER a Farmer found a Snake stiff and frozen with cold. He had\r\ncompassion on it, and taking it up, placed it in his bosom. The Snake\r\nwas quickly revived by the warmth, and resuming its natural instincts,\r\nbit its benefactor, inflicting on him a mortal wound. \"Oh,\" cried\r\nthe Farmer with his last breath, \"I am rightly served for pitying a\r\nscoundrel.\"\r\n\r\nThe greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fawn and His Mother\r\n\r\nA YOUNG FAWN once said to his Mother, \"You are larger than a dog, and\r\nswifter, and more used to running, and you have your horns as a defense;\r\nwhy, then, O Mother! do the hounds frighten you so?\" She smiled, and\r\nsaid: \"I know full well, my son, that all you say is true. I have the\r\nadvantages you mention, but when I hear even the bark of a single dog I\r\nfeel ready to faint, and fly away as fast as I can.\"\r\n\r\nNo arguments will give courage to the coward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bear and the Fox\r\n\r\nA BEAR boasted very much of his philanthropy, saying that of all animals\r\nhe was the most tender in his regard for man, for he had such respect\r\nfor him that he would not even touch his dead body. A Fox hearing these\r\nwords said with a smile to the Bear, \"Oh! that you would eat the dead\r\nand not the living.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Swallow and the Crow\r\n\r\nTHE SWALLOW and the Crow had a contention about their plumage. The Crow\r\nput an end to the dispute by saying, \"Your feathers are all very well in\r\nthe spring, but mine protect me against the winter.\"\r\n\r\nFair weather friends are not worth much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mountain in Labor\r\n\r\nA MOUNTAIN was once greatly agitated. Loud groans and noises were heard,\r\nand crowds of people came from all parts to see what was the matter.\r\nWhile they were assembled in anxious expectation of some terrible\r\ncalamity, out came a Mouse.\r\n\r\nDon't make much ado about nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ass, the Fox, and the Lion\r\n\r\nTHE ASS and the Fox, having entered into partnership together for\r\ntheir mutual protection, went out into the forest to hunt. They had not\r\nproceeded far when they met a Lion. The Fox, seeing imminent danger,\r\napproached the Lion and promised to contrive for him the capture of the\r\nAss if the Lion would pledge his word not to harm the Fox. Then, upon\r\nassuring the Ass that he would not be injured, the Fox led him to a deep\r\npit and arranged that he should fall into it. The Lion, seeing that the\r\nAss was secured, immediately clutched the Fox, and attacked the Ass at\r\nhis leisure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tortoise and the Eagle\r\n\r\nA TORTOISE, lazily basking in the sun, complained to the sea-birds of\r\nher hard fate, that no one would teach her to fly. An Eagle, hovering\r\nnear, heard her lamentation and demanded what reward she would give him\r\nif he would take her aloft and float her in the air. \"I will give you,\"\r\nshe said, \"all the riches of the Red Sea.\" \"I will teach you to fly\r\nthen,\" said the Eagle; and taking her up in his talons he carried her\r\nalmost to the clouds suddenly he let her go, and she fell on a lofty\r\nmountain, dashing her shell to pieces. The Tortoise exclaimed in the\r\nmoment of death: \"I have deserved my present fate; for what had I to do\r\nwith wings and clouds, who can with difficulty move about on the earth?\"\r\n\r\nIf men had all they wished, they would be often ruined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Flies and the Honey-Pot\r\n\r\nA NUMBER of Flies were attracted to a jar of honey which had been\r\noverturned in a housekeeper's room, and placing their feet in it, ate\r\ngreedily. Their feet, however, became so smeared with the honey that\r\nthey could not use their wings, nor release themselves, and were\r\nsuffocated. Just as they were expiring, they exclaimed, \"O foolish\r\ncreatures that we are, for the sake of a little pleasure we have\r\ndestroyed ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nPleasure bought with pains, hurts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Man and the Lion\r\n\r\nA MAN and a Lion traveled together through the forest. They soon began\r\nto boast of their respective superiority to each other in strength and\r\nprowess. As they were disputing, they passed a statue carved in stone,\r\nwhich represented \"a Lion strangled by a Man.\" The traveler pointed to\r\nit and said: \"See there! How strong we are, and how we prevail over even\r\nthe king of beasts.\" The Lion replied: \"This statue was made by one of\r\nyou men. If we Lions knew how to erect statues, you would see the Man\r\nplaced under the paw of the Lion.\"\r\n\r\nOne story is good, till another is told.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Farmer and the Cranes\r\n\r\nSOME CRANES made their feeding grounds on some plowlands newly sown with\r\nwheat. For a long time the Farmer, brandishing an empty sling, chased\r\nthem away by the terror he inspired; but when the birds found that the\r\nsling was only swung in the air, they ceased to take any notice of it\r\nand would not move. The Farmer, on seeing this, charged his sling with\r\nstones, and killed a great number. The remaining birds at once forsook\r\nhis fields, crying to each other, \"It is time for us to be off to\r\nLiliput: for this man is no longer content to scare us, but begins to\r\nshow us in earnest what he can do.\"\r\n\r\nIf words suffice not, blows must follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dog in the Manger\r\n\r\nA DOG lay in a manger, and by his growling and snapping prevented the\r\noxen from eating the hay which had been placed for them. \"What a\r\nselfish Dog!\" said one of them to his companions; \"he cannot eat the hay\r\nhimself, and yet refuses to allow those to eat who can.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fox and the Goat\r\n\r\nA FOX one day fell into a deep well and could find no means of escape.\r\nA Goat, overcome with thirst, came to the same well, and seeing the Fox,\r\ninquired if the water was good. Concealing his sad plight under a merry\r\nguise, the Fox indulged in a lavish praise of the water, saying it was\r\nexcellent beyond measure, and encouraging him to descend. The Goat,\r\nmindful only of his thirst, thoughtlessly jumped down, but just as he\r\ndrank, the Fox informed him of the difficulty they were both in and\r\nsuggested a scheme for their common escape. \"If,\" said he, \"you will\r\nplace your forefeet upon the wall and bend your head, I will run up your\r\nback and escape, and will help you out afterwards.\" The Goat readily\r\nassented and the Fox leaped upon his back. Steadying himself with the\r\nGoat's horns, he safely reached the mouth of the well and made off as\r\nfast as he could. When the Goat upbraided him for breaking his promise,\r\nhe turned around and cried out, \"You foolish old fellow! If you had\r\nas many brains in your head as you have hairs in your beard, you would\r\nnever have gone down before you had inspected the way up, nor have\r\nexposed yourself to dangers from which you had no means of escape.\"\r\n\r\nLook before you leap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bear and the Two Travelers\r\n\r\nTWO MEN were traveling together, when a Bear suddenly met them on their\r\npath. One of them climbed up quickly into a tree and concealed himself\r\nin the branches. The other, seeing that he must be attacked, fell flat\r\non the ground, and when the Bear came up and felt him with his snout,\r\nand smelt him all over, he held his breath, and feigned the appearance\r\nof death as much as he could. The Bear soon left him, for it is said he\r\nwill not touch a dead body. When he was quite gone, the other Traveler\r\ndescended from the tree, and jocularly inquired of his friend what it\r\nwas the Bear had whispered in his ear. \"He gave me this advice,\" his\r\ncompanion replied. \"Never travel with a friend who deserts you at the\r\napproach of danger.\"\r\n\r\nMisfortune tests the sincerity of friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Oxen and the Axle-Trees\r\n\r\nA HEAVY WAGON was being dragged along a country lane by a team of Oxen.\r\nThe Axle-trees groaned and creaked terribly; whereupon the Oxen, turning\r\nround, thus addressed the wheels: \"Hullo there! why do you make so much\r\nnoise? We bear all the labor, and we, not you, ought to cry out.\"\r\n\r\nThose who suffer most cry out the least.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Thirsty Pigeon\r\n\r\nA PIGEON, oppressed by excessive thirst, saw a goblet of water painted\r\non a signboard. Not supposing it to be only a picture, she flew towards\r\nit with a loud whir and unwittingly dashed against the signboard,\r\njarring herself terribly. Having broken her wings by the blow, she fell\r\nto the ground, and was caught by one of the bystanders.\r\n\r\nZeal should not outrun discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Raven and the Swan\r\n\r\nA RAVEN saw a Swan and desired to secure for himself the same beautiful\r\nplumage. Supposing that the Swan's splendid white color arose from his\r\nwashing in the water in which he swam, the Raven left the altars in the\r\nneighborhood where he picked up his living, and took up residence in\r\nthe lakes and pools. But cleansing his feathers as often as he would, he\r\ncould not change their color, while through want of food he perished.\r\n\r\nChange of habit cannot alter Nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Goat and the Goatherd\r\n\r\nA GOATHERD had sought to bring back a stray goat to his flock. He\r\nwhistled and sounded his horn in vain; the straggler paid no attention\r\nto the summons. At last the Goatherd threw a stone, and breaking its\r\nhorn, begged the Goat not to tell his master. The Goat replied, \"Why,\r\nyou silly fellow, the horn will speak though I be silent.\"\r\n\r\nDo not attempt to hide things which cannot be hid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Miser\r\n\r\nA MISER sold all that he had and bought a lump of gold, which he buried\r\nin a hole in the ground by the side of an old wall and went to look at\r\ndaily. One of his workmen observed his frequent visits to the spot and\r\ndecided to watch his movements. He soon discovered the secret of the\r\nhidden treasure, and digging down, came to the lump of gold, and stole\r\nit. The Miser, on his next visit, found the hole empty and began to tear\r\nhis hair and to make loud lamentations. A neighbor, seeing him overcome\r\nwith grief and learning the cause, said, \"Pray do not grieve so; but go\r\nand take a stone, and place it in the hole, and fancy that the gold is\r\nstill lying there. It will do you quite the same service; for when the\r\ngold was there, you had it not, as you did not make the slightest use of\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sick Lion\r\n\r\nA LION, unable from old age and infirmities to provide himself with food\r\nby force, resolved to do so by artifice. He returned to his den, and\r\nlying down there, pretended to be sick, taking care that his sickness\r\nshould be publicly known. The beasts expressed their sorrow, and came\r\none by one to his den, where the Lion devoured them. After many of the\r\nbeasts had thus disappeared, the Fox discovered the trick and presenting\r\nhimself to the Lion, stood on the outside of the cave, at a respectful\r\ndistance, and asked him how he was. \"I am very middling,\" replied the\r\nLion, \"but why do you stand without? Pray enter within to talk with me.\"\r\n\"No, thank you,\" said the Fox. \"I notice that there are many prints of\r\nfeet entering your cave, but I see no trace of any returning.\"\r\n\r\nHe is wise who is warned by the misfortunes of others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Horse and Groom\r\n\r\nA GROOM used to spend whole days in currycombing and rubbing down his\r\nHorse, but at the same time stole his oats and sold them for his own\r\nprofit. \"Alas!\" said the Horse, \"if you really wish me to be in good\r\ncondition, you should groom me less, and feed me more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ass and the Lapdog\r\n\r\nA MAN had an Ass, and a Maltese Lapdog, a very great beauty. The Ass\r\nwas left in a stable and had plenty of oats and hay to eat, just as any\r\nother Ass would. The Lapdog knew many tricks and was a great favorite\r\nwith his master, who often fondled him and seldom went out to dine\r\nwithout bringing him home some tidbit to eat. The Ass, on the contrary,\r\nhad much work to do in grinding the corn-mill and in carrying wood from\r\nthe forest or burdens from the farm. He often lamented his own hard fate\r\nand contrasted it with the luxury and idleness of the Lapdog, till\r\nat last one day he broke his cords and halter, and galloped into his\r\nmaster's house, kicking up his heels without measure, and frisking and\r\nfawning as well as he could. He next tried to jump about his master as\r\nhe had seen the Lapdog do, but he broke the table and smashed all the\r\ndishes upon it to atoms. He then attempted to lick his master, and\r\njumped upon his back. The servants, hearing the strange hubbub and\r\nperceiving the danger of their master, quickly relieved him, and drove\r\nout the Ass to his stable with kicks and clubs and cuffs. The Ass, as\r\nhe returned to his stall beaten nearly to death, thus lamented: \"I have\r\nbrought it all on myself! Why could I not have been contented to labor\r\nwith my companions, and not wish to be idle all the day like that\r\nuseless little Lapdog!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lioness\r\n\r\nA CONTROVERSY prevailed among the beasts of the field as to which of the\r\nanimals deserved the most credit for producing the greatest number of\r\nwhelps at a birth. They rushed clamorously into the presence of the\r\nLioness and demanded of her the settlement of the dispute. \"And you,\"\r\nthey said, \"how many sons have you at a birth?\" The Lioness laughed\r\nat them, and said: \"Why! I have only one; but that one is altogether a\r\nthoroughbred Lion.\"\r\n\r\nThe value is in the worth, not in the number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Boasting Traveler\r\n\r\nA MAN who had traveled in foreign lands boasted very much, on returning\r\nto his own country, of the many wonderful and heroic feats he had\r\nperformed in the different places he had visited. Among other things, he\r\nsaid that when he was at Rhodes he had leaped to such a distance that\r\nno man of his day could leap anywhere near him as to that, there were\r\nin Rhodes many persons who saw him do it and whom he could call as\r\nwitnesses. One of the bystanders interrupted him, saying: \"Now, my good\r\nman, if this be all true there is no need of witnesses. Suppose this to\r\nbe Rhodes, and leap for us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cat and the Cock\r\n\r\nA CAT caught a Cock, and pondered how he might find a reasonable excuse\r\nfor eating him. He accused him of being a nuisance to men by crowing\r\nin the nighttime and not permitting them to sleep. The Cock defended\r\nhimself by saying that he did this for the benefit of men, that they\r\nmight rise in time for their labors. The Cat replied, \"Although you\r\nabound in specious apologies, I shall not remain supperless;\" and he\r\nmade a meal of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Piglet, the Sheep, and the Goat\r\n\r\nA YOUNG PIG was shut up in a fold-yard with a Goat and a Sheep. On one\r\noccasion when the shepherd laid hold of him, he grunted and squeaked and\r\nresisted violently. The Sheep and the Goat complained of his distressing\r\ncries, saying, \"He often handles us, and we do not cry out.\" To this\r\nthe Pig replied, \"Your handling and mine are very different things. He\r\ncatches you only for your wool, or your milk, but he lays hold on me for\r\nmy very life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Boy and the Filberts\r\n\r\nA BOY put his hand into a pitcher full of filberts. He grasped as many\r\nas he could possibly hold, but when he tried to pull out his hand, he\r\nwas prevented from doing so by the neck of the pitcher. Unwilling to\r\nlose his filberts, and yet unable to withdraw his hand, he burst into\r\ntears and bitterly lamented his disappointment. A bystander said to him,\r\n\"Be satisfied with half the quantity, and you will readily draw out your\r\nhand.\"\r\n\r\nDo not attempt too much at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion in Love\r\n\r\nA LION demanded the daughter of a woodcutter in marriage. The Father,\r\nunwilling to grant, and yet afraid to refuse his request, hit upon\r\nthis expedient to rid himself of his importunities. He expressed his\r\nwillingness to accept the Lion as the suitor of his daughter on one\r\ncondition: that he should allow him to extract his teeth, and cut\r\noff his claws, as his daughter was fearfully afraid of both. The Lion\r\ncheerfully assented to the proposal. But when the toothless, clawless\r\nLion returned to repeat his request, the Woodman, no longer afraid, set\r\nupon him with his club, and drove him away into the forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Laborer and the Snake\r\n\r\nA SNAKE, having made his hole close to the porch of a cottage, inflicted\r\na mortal bite on the Cottager's infant son. Grieving over his loss, the\r\nFather resolved to kill the Snake. The next day, when it came out of its\r\nhole for food, he took up his axe, but by swinging too hastily, missed\r\nits head and cut off only the end of its tail. After some time the\r\nCottager, afraid that the Snake would bite him also, endeavored to make\r\npeace, and placed some bread and salt in the hole. The Snake, slightly\r\nhissing, said: \"There can henceforth be no peace between us; for\r\nwhenever I see you I shall remember the loss of my tail, and whenever\r\nyou see me you will be thinking of the death of your son.\"\r\n\r\nNo one truly forgets injuries in the presence of him who caused the\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wolf in Sheep's Clothing\r\n\r\nONCE UPON A TIME a Wolf resolved to disguise his appearance in order\r\nto secure food more easily. Encased in the skin of a sheep, he pastured\r\nwith the flock deceiving the shepherd by his costume. In the evening he\r\nwas shut up by the shepherd in the fold; the gate was closed, and the\r\nentrance made thoroughly secure. But the shepherd, returning to the fold\r\nduring the night to obtain meat for the next day, mistakenly caught up\r\nthe Wolf instead of a sheep, and killed him instantly.\r\n\r\nHarm seek, harm find.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ass and the Mule\r\n\r\nA MULETEER set forth on a journey, driving before him an Ass and a\r\nMule, both well laden. The Ass, as long as he traveled along the plain,\r\ncarried his load with ease, but when he began to ascend the steep\r\npath of the mountain, felt his load to be more than he could bear. He\r\nentreated his companion to relieve him of a small portion, that he might\r\ncarry home the rest; but the Mule paid no attention to the request. The\r\nAss shortly afterwards fell down dead under his burden. Not knowing what\r\nelse to do in so wild a region, the Muleteer placed upon the Mule the\r\nload carried by the Ass in addition to his own, and at the top of all\r\nplaced the hide of the Ass, after he had skinned him. The Mule, groaning\r\nbeneath his heavy burden, said to himself: \"I am treated according to\r\nmy deserts. If I had only been willing to assist the Ass a little in his\r\nneed, I should not now be bearing, together with his burden, himself as\r\nwell.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Frogs Asking for a King\r\n\r\nTHE FROGS, grieved at having no established Ruler, sent ambassadors to\r\nJupiter entreating for a King. Perceiving their simplicity, he cast\r\ndown a huge log into the lake. The Frogs were terrified at the splash\r\noccasioned by its fall and hid themselves in the depths of the pool.\r\nBut as soon as they realized that the huge log was motionless, they swam\r\nagain to the top of the water, dismissed their fears, climbed up, and\r\nbegan squatting on it in contempt. After some time they began to think\r\nthemselves ill-treated in the appointment of so inert a Ruler, and\r\nsent a second deputation to Jupiter to pray that he would set over them\r\nanother sovereign. He then gave them an Eel to govern them. When the\r\nFrogs discovered his easy good nature, they sent yet a third time to\r\nJupiter to beg him to choose for them still another King. Jupiter,\r\ndispleased with all their complaints, sent a Heron, who preyed upon the\r\nFrogs day by day till there were none left to croak upon the lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Boys and the Frogs\r\n\r\nSOME BOYS, playing near a pond, saw a number of Frogs in the water and\r\nbegan to pelt them with stones. They killed several of them, when one of\r\nthe Frogs, lifting his head out of the water, cried out: \"Pray stop, my\r\nboys: what is sport to you, is death to us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sick Stag\r\n\r\nA SICK STAG lay down in a quiet corner of its pasture-ground. His\r\ncompanions came in great numbers to inquire after his health, and each\r\none helped himself to a share of the food which had been placed for his\r\nuse; so that he died, not from his sickness, but from the failure of the\r\nmeans of living.\r\n\r\nEvil companions bring more hurt than profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Salt Merchant and His Ass\r\n\r\nA PEDDLER drove his Ass to the seashore to buy salt. His road home\r\nlay across a stream into which his Ass, making a false step, fell by\r\naccident and rose up again with his load considerably lighter, as the\r\nwater melted the sack. The Peddler retraced his steps and refilled his\r\npanniers with a larger quantity of salt than before. When he came again\r\nto the stream, the Ass fell down on purpose in the same spot, and,\r\nregaining his feet with the weight of his load much diminished, brayed\r\ntriumphantly as if he had obtained what he desired. The Peddler saw\r\nthrough his trick and drove him for the third time to the coast, where\r\nhe bought a cargo of sponges instead of salt. The Ass, again playing the\r\nfool, fell down on purpose when he reached the stream, but the sponges\r\nbecame swollen with water, greatly increasing his load. And thus his\r\ntrick recoiled on him, for he now carried on his back a double burden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Oxen and the Butchers\r\n\r\nTHE OXEN once upon a time sought to destroy the Butchers, who practiced\r\na trade destructive to their race. They assembled on a certain day to\r\ncarry out their purpose, and sharpened their horns for the contest. But\r\none of them who was exceedingly old (for many a field had he plowed)\r\nthus spoke: \"These Butchers, it is true, slaughter us, but they do so\r\nwith skillful hands, and with no unnecessary pain. If we get rid of\r\nthem, we shall fall into the hands of unskillful operators, and thus\r\nsuffer a double death: for you may be assured, that though all the\r\nButchers should perish, yet will men never want beef.\"\r\n\r\nDo not be in a hurry to change one evil for another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion, the Mouse, and the Fox\r\n\r\nA LION, fatigued by the heat of a summer's day, fell fast asleep in his\r\nden. A Mouse ran over his mane and ears and woke him from his slumbers.\r\nHe rose up and shook himself in great wrath, and searched every corner\r\nof his den to find the Mouse. A Fox seeing him said: \"A fine Lion you\r\nare, to be frightened of a Mouse.\" \"'Tis not the Mouse I fear,\" said the\r\nLion; \"I resent his familiarity and ill-breeding.\"\r\n\r\nLittle liberties are great offenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vain Jackdaw\r\n\r\nJUPITER DETERMINED, it is said, to create a sovereign over the birds,\r\nand made proclamation that on a certain day they should all present\r\nthemselves before him, when he would himself choose the most beautiful\r\namong them to be king. The Jackdaw, knowing his own ugliness, searched\r\nthrough the woods and fields, and collected the feathers which had\r\nfallen from the wings of his companions, and stuck them in all parts of\r\nhis body, hoping thereby to make himself the most beautiful of all. When\r\nthe appointed day arrived, and the birds had assembled before Jupiter,\r\nthe Jackdaw also made his appearance in his many feathered finery. But\r\nwhen Jupiter proposed to make him king because of the beauty of his\r\nplumage, the birds indignantly protested, and each plucked from him his\r\nown feathers, leaving the Jackdaw nothing but a Jackdaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Goatherd and the Wild Goats\r\n\r\nA GOATHERD, driving his flock from their pasture at eventide, found some\r\nWild Goats mingled among them, and shut them up together with his own\r\nfor the night. The next day it snowed very hard, so that he could not\r\ntake the herd to their usual feeding places, but was obliged to keep\r\nthem in the fold. He gave his own goats just sufficient food to keep\r\nthem alive, but fed the strangers more abundantly in the hope of\r\nenticing them to stay with him and of making them his own. When the thaw\r\nset in, he led them all out to feed, and the Wild Goats scampered away\r\nas fast as they could to the mountains. The Goatherd scolded them for\r\ntheir ingratitude in leaving him, when during the storm he had taken\r\nmore care of them than of his own herd. One of them, turning about,\r\nsaid to him: \"That is the very reason why we are so cautious; for if you\r\nyesterday treated us better than the Goats you have had so long, it is\r\nplain also that if others came after us, you would in the same manner\r\nprefer them to ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOld friends cannot with impunity be sacrificed for new ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mischievous Dog\r\n\r\nA DOG used to run up quietly to the heels of everyone he met, and to\r\nbite them without notice. His master suspended a bell about his neck\r\nso that the Dog might give notice of his presence wherever he went.\r\nThinking it a mark of distinction, the Dog grew proud of his bell and\r\nwent tinkling it all over the marketplace. One day an old hound said to\r\nhim: \"Why do you make such an exhibition of yourself? That bell that you\r\ncarry is not, believe me, any order of merit, but on the contrary a mark\r\nof disgrace, a public notice to all men to avoid you as an ill mannered\r\ndog.\"\r\n\r\nNotoriety is often mistaken for fame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fox Who Had Lost His Tail\r\n\r\nA FOX caught in a trap escaped, but in so doing lost his tail.\r\nThereafter, feeling his life a burden from the shame and ridicule to\r\nwhich he was exposed, he schemed to convince all the other Foxes that\r\nbeing tailless was much more attractive, thus making up for his own\r\ndeprivation. He assembled a good many Foxes and publicly advised them\r\nto cut off their tails, saying that they would not only look much better\r\nwithout them, but that they would get rid of the weight of the brush,\r\nwhich was a very great inconvenience. One of them interrupting him said,\r\n\"If you had not yourself lost your tail, my friend, you would not thus\r\ncounsel us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Boy and the Nettles\r\n\r\nA BOY was stung by a Nettle. He ran home and told his Mother, saying,\r\n\"Although it hurts me very much, I only touched it gently.\" \"That was\r\njust why it stung you,\" said his Mother. \"The next time you touch a\r\nNettle, grasp it boldly, and it will be soft as silk to your hand, and\r\nnot in the least hurt you.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever you do, do with all your might.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Man and His Two Sweethearts\r\n\r\nA MIDDLE-AGED MAN, whose hair had begun to turn gray, courted two women\r\nat the same time. One of them was young, and the other well advanced\r\nin years. The elder woman, ashamed to be courted by a man younger than\r\nherself, made a point, whenever her admirer visited her, to pull out\r\nsome portion of his black hairs. The younger, on the contrary, not\r\nwishing to become the wife of an old man, was equally zealous in\r\nremoving every gray hair she could find. Thus it came to pass that\r\nbetween them both he very soon found that he had not a hair left on his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThose who seek to please everybody please nobody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Astronomer\r\n\r\nAN ASTRONOMER used to go out at night to observe the stars. One evening,\r\nas he wandered through the suburbs with his whole attention fixed on\r\nthe sky, he fell accidentally into a deep well. While he lamented and\r\nbewailed his sores and bruises, and cried loudly for help, a neighbor\r\nran to the well, and learning what had happened said: \"Hark ye, old\r\nfellow, why, in striving to pry into what is in heaven, do you not\r\nmanage to see what is on earth?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wolves and the Sheep\r\n\r\n\"WHY SHOULD there always be this fear and slaughter between us?\" said\r\nthe Wolves to the Sheep. \"Those evil-disposed Dogs have much to answer\r\nfor. They always bark whenever we approach you and attack us before\r\nwe have done any harm. If you would only dismiss them from your heels,\r\nthere might soon be treaties of peace and reconciliation between us.\"\r\nThe Sheep, poor silly creatures, were easily beguiled and dismissed the\r\nDogs, whereupon the Wolves destroyed the unguarded flock at their own\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Old Woman and the Physician\r\n\r\nAN OLD WOMAN having lost the use of her eyes, called in a Physician to\r\nheal them, and made this bargain with him in the presence of witnesses:\r\nthat if he should cure her blindness, he should receive from her a sum\r\nof money; but if her infirmity remained, she should give him nothing.\r\nThis agreement being made, the Physician, time after time, applied his\r\nsalve to her eyes, and on every visit took something away, stealing\r\nall her property little by little. And when he had got all she had, he\r\nhealed her and demanded the promised payment. The Old Woman, when she\r\nrecovered her sight and saw none of her goods in her house, would give\r\nhim nothing. The Physician insisted on his claim, and, as she still\r\nrefused, summoned her before the Judge. The Old Woman, standing up in\r\nthe Court, argued: \"This man here speaks the truth in what he says; for\r\nI did promise to give him a sum of money if I should recover my sight:\r\nbut if I continued blind, I was to give him nothing. Now he declares\r\nthat I am healed. I on the contrary affirm that I am still blind; for\r\nwhen I lost the use of my eyes, I saw in my house various chattels and\r\nvaluable goods: but now, though he swears I am cured of my blindness, I\r\nam not able to see a single thing in it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fighting Cocks and the Eagle\r\n\r\nTWO GAME COCKS were fiercely fighting for the mastery of the farmyard.\r\nOne at last put the other to flight. The vanquished Cock skulked away\r\nand hid himself in a quiet corner, while the conqueror, flying up to a\r\nhigh wall, flapped his wings and crowed exultingly with all his might.\r\nAn Eagle sailing through the air pounced upon him and carried him off in\r\nhis talons. The vanquished Cock immediately came out of his corner, and\r\nruled henceforth with undisputed mastery.\r\n\r\nPride goes before destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Charger and the Miller\r\n\r\nA CHARGER, feeling the infirmities of age, was sent to work in a mill\r\ninstead of going out to battle. But when he was compelled to grind\r\ninstead of serving in the wars, he bewailed his change of fortune and\r\ncalled to mind his former state, saying, \"Ah! Miller, I had indeed to\r\ngo campaigning before, but I was barbed from counter to tail, and a man\r\nwent along to groom me; and now I cannot understand what ailed me to\r\nprefer the mill before the battle.\" \"Forbear,\" said the Miller to him,\r\n\"harping on what was of yore, for it is the common lot of mortals to\r\nsustain the ups and downs of fortune.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fox and the Monkey\r\n\r\nA MONKEY once danced in an assembly of the Beasts, and so pleased them\r\nall by his performance that they elected him their King. A Fox, envying\r\nhim the honor, discovered a piece of meat lying in a trap, and leading\r\nthe Monkey to the place where it was, said that she had found a store,\r\nbut had not used it, she had kept it for him as treasure trove of his\r\nkingdom, and counseled him to lay hold of it. The Monkey approached\r\ncarelessly and was caught in the trap; and on his accusing the Fox of\r\npurposely leading him into the snare, she replied, \"O Monkey, and are\r\nyou, with such a mind as yours, going to be King over the Beasts?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Horse and His Rider\r\n\r\nA HORSE SOLDIER took the utmost pains with his charger. As long as the\r\nwar lasted, he looked upon him as his fellow-helper in all emergencies\r\nand fed him carefully with hay and corn. But when the war was over, he\r\nonly allowed him chaff to eat and made him carry heavy loads of wood,\r\nsubjecting him to much slavish drudgery and ill-treatment. War was again\r\nproclaimed, however, and when the trumpet summoned him to his standard,\r\nthe Soldier put on his charger its military trappings, and mounted,\r\nbeing clad in his heavy coat of mail. The Horse fell down straightway\r\nunder the weight, no longer equal to the burden, and said to his master,\r\n\"You must now go to the war on foot, for you have transformed me from\r\na Horse into an Ass; and how can you expect that I can again turn in a\r\nmoment from an Ass to a Horse?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Belly and the Members\r\n\r\nTHE MEMBERS of the Body rebelled against the Belly, and said, \"Why\r\nshould we be perpetually engaged in administering to your wants, while\r\nyou do nothing but take your rest, and enjoy yourself in luxury and\r\nself-indulgence?\" The Members carried out their resolve and refused\r\ntheir assistance to the Belly. The whole Body quickly became\r\ndebilitated, and the hands, feet, mouth, and eyes, when too late,\r\nrepented of their folly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vine and the Goat\r\n\r\nA VINE was luxuriant in the time of vintage with leaves and grapes. A\r\nGoat, passing by, nibbled its young tendrils and its leaves. The Vine\r\naddressed him and said: \"Why do you thus injure me without a cause, and\r\ncrop my leaves? Is there no young grass left? But I shall not have to\r\nwait long for my just revenge; for if you now should crop my leaves, and\r\ncut me down to my root, I shall provide the wine to pour over you when\r\nyou are led as a victim to the sacrifice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJupiter and the Monkey\r\n\r\nJUPITER ISSUED a proclamation to all the beasts of the forest and\r\npromised a royal reward to the one whose offspring should be deemed\r\nthe handsomest. The Monkey came with the rest and presented, with all a\r\nmother's tenderness, a flat-nosed, hairless, ill-featured young Monkey\r\nas a candidate for the promised reward. A general laugh saluted her on\r\nthe presentation of her son. She resolutely said, \"I know not whether\r\nJupiter will allot the prize to my son, but this I do know, that he is\r\nat least in the eyes of me his mother, the dearest, handsomest, and most\r\nbeautiful of all.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Widow and Her Little Maidens\r\n\r\nA WIDOW who was fond of cleaning had two little maidens to wait on her.\r\nShe was in the habit of waking them early in the morning, at cockcrow.\r\nThe maidens, aggravated by such excessive labor, resolved to kill the\r\ncock who roused their mistress so early. When they had done this, they\r\nfound that they had only prepared for themselves greater troubles, for\r\ntheir mistress, no longer hearing the hour from the cock, woke them up\r\nto their work in the middle of the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Shepherd's Boy and the Wolf\r\n\r\nA SHEPHERD-BOY, who watched a flock of sheep near a village, brought out\r\nthe villagers three or four times by crying out, \"Wolf! Wolf!\" and when\r\nhis neighbors came to help him, laughed at them for their pains. The\r\nWolf, however, did truly come at last. The Shepherd-boy, now really\r\nalarmed, shouted in an agony of terror: \"Pray, do come and help me; the\r\nWolf is killing the sheep;\" but no one paid any heed to his cries,\r\nnor rendered any assistance. The Wolf, having no cause of fear, at his\r\nleisure lacerated or destroyed the whole flock.\r\n\r\nThere is no believing a liar, even when he speaks the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cat and the Birds\r\n\r\nA CAT, hearing that the Birds in a certain aviary were ailing dressed\r\nhimself up as a physician, and, taking his cane and a bag of instruments\r\nbecoming his profession, went to call on them. He knocked at the door\r\nand inquired of the inmates how they all did, saying that if they\r\nwere ill, he would be happy to prescribe for them and cure them. They\r\nreplied, \"We are all very well, and shall continue so, if you will only\r\nbe good enough to go away, and leave us as we are.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kid and the Wolf\r\n\r\nA KID standing on the roof of a house, out of harm's way, saw a Wolf\r\npassing by and immediately began to taunt and revile him. The Wolf,\r\nlooking up, said, \"Sirrah! I hear thee: yet it is not thou who mockest\r\nme, but the roof on which thou art standing.\"\r\n\r\nTime and place often give the advantage to the weak over the strong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ox and the Frog\r\n\r\nAN OX drinking at a pool trod on a brood of young frogs and crushed one\r\nof them to death. The Mother coming up, and missing one of her sons,\r\ninquired of his brothers what had become of him. \"He is dead, dear\r\nMother; for just now a very huge beast with four great feet came to the\r\npool and crushed him to death with his cloven heel.\" The Frog, puffing\r\nherself out, inquired, \"if the beast was as big as that in size.\"\r\n\"Cease, Mother, to puff yourself out,\" said her son, \"and do not be\r\nangry; for you would, I assure you, sooner burst than successfully\r\nimitate the hugeness of that monster.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Shepherd and the Wolf\r\n\r\n A SHEPHERD once found the whelp of a Wolf and brought it up, and\r\nafter a while taught it to steal lambs from the neighboring flocks. The\r\nWolf, having shown himself an apt pupil, said to the Shepherd, \"Since\r\nyou have taught me to steal, you must keep a sharp lookout, or you will\r\nlose some of your own flock.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Father and His Two Daughters\r\n\r\nA MAN had two daughters, the one married to a gardener, and the other to\r\na tile-maker. After a time he went to the daughter who had married the\r\ngardener, and inquired how she was and how all things went with her. She\r\nsaid, \"All things are prospering with me, and I have only one wish, that\r\nthere may be a heavy fall of rain, in order that the plants may be well\r\nwatered.\" Not long after, he went to the daughter who had married the\r\ntilemaker, and likewise inquired of her how she fared; she replied,\r\n\"I want for nothing, and have only one wish, that the dry weather may\r\ncontinue, and the sun shine hot and bright, so that the bricks might be\r\ndried.\" He said to her, \"If your sister wishes for rain, and you for dry\r\nweather, with which of the two am I to join my wishes?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Farmer and His Sons\r\n\r\nA FATHER, being on the point of death, wished to be sure that his sons\r\nwould give the same attention to his farm as he himself had given it. He\r\ncalled them to his bedside and said, \"My sons, there is a great treasure\r\nhid in one of my vineyards.\" The sons, after his death, took their\r\nspades and mattocks and carefully dug over every portion of their\r\nland. They found no treasure, but the vines repaid their labor by an\r\nextraordinary and superabundant crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crab and Its Mother\r\n\r\nA CRAB said to her son, \"Why do you walk so one-sided, my child? It\r\nis far more becoming to go straight forward.\" The young Crab replied:\r\n\"Quite true, dear Mother; and if you will show me the straight way, I\r\nwill promise to walk in it.\" The Mother tried in vain, and submitted\r\nwithout remonstrance to the reproof of her child.\r\n\r\nExample is more powerful than precept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Heifer and the Ox\r\n\r\nA HEIFER saw an Ox hard at work harnessed to a plow, and tormented\r\nhim with reflections on his unhappy fate in being compelled to labor.\r\nShortly afterwards, at the harvest festival, the owner released the Ox\r\nfrom his yoke, but bound the Heifer with cords and led him away to the\r\naltar to be slain in honor of the occasion. The Ox saw what was being\r\ndone, and said with a smile to the Heifer: \"For this you were allowed to\r\nlive in idleness, because you were presently to be sacrificed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Swallow, the Serpent, and the Court of Justice\r\n\r\nA SWALLOW, returning from abroad and especially fond of dwelling with\r\nmen, built herself a nest in the wall of a Court of Justice and there\r\nhatched seven young birds. A Serpent gliding past the nest from its hole\r\nin the wall ate up the young unfledged nestlings. The Swallow, finding\r\nher nest empty, lamented greatly and exclaimed: \"Woe to me a stranger!\r\nthat in this place where all others' rights are protected, I alone\r\nshould suffer wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Thief and His Mother\r\n\r\nA BOY stole a lesson-book from one of his schoolfellows and took it home\r\nto his Mother. She not only abstained from beating him, but encouraged\r\nhim. He next time stole a cloak and brought it to her, and she again\r\ncommended him. The Youth, advanced to adulthood, proceeded to steal\r\nthings of still greater value. At last he was caught in the very act,\r\nand having his hands bound behind him, was led away to the place of\r\npublic execution. His Mother followed in the crowd and violently beat\r\nher breast in sorrow, whereupon the young man said, \"I wish to say\r\nsomething to my Mother in her ear.\" She came close to him, and he\r\nquickly seized her ear with his teeth and bit it off. The Mother\r\nupbraided him as an unnatural child, whereon he replied, \"Ah! if you\r\nhad beaten me when I first stole and brought to you that lesson-book,\r\nI should not have come to this, nor have been thus led to a disgraceful\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Old Man and Death\r\n\r\nAN OLD MAN was employed in cutting wood in the forest, and, in carrying\r\nthe faggots to the city for sale one day, became very wearied with his\r\nlong journey. He sat down by the wayside, and throwing down his load,\r\nbesought \"Death\" to come. \"Death\" immediately appeared in answer to\r\nhis summons and asked for what reason he had called him. The Old Man\r\nhurriedly replied, \"That, lifting up the load, you may place it again\r\nupon my shoulders.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fir-Tree and the Bramble\r\n\r\nA FIR-TREE said boastingly to the Bramble, \"You are useful for nothing\r\nat all; while I am everywhere used for roofs and houses.\" The Bramble\r\nanswered: \"You poor creature, if you would only call to mind the axes\r\nand saws which are about to hew you down, you would have reason to wish\r\nthat you had grown up a Bramble, not a Fir-Tree.\"\r\n\r\nBetter poverty without care, than riches with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mouse, the Frog, and the Hawk\r\n\r\nA MOUSE who always lived on the land, by an unlucky chance formed an\r\nintimate acquaintance with a Frog, who lived for the most part in the\r\nwater. The Frog, one day intent on mischief, bound the foot of the Mouse\r\ntightly to his own. Thus joined together, the Frog first of all led his\r\nfriend the Mouse to the meadow where they were accustomed to find their\r\nfood. After this, he gradually led him towards the pool in which he\r\nlived, until reaching the very brink, he suddenly jumped in, dragging\r\nthe Mouse with him. The Frog enjoyed the water amazingly, and swam\r\ncroaking about, as if he had done a good deed. The unhappy Mouse was\r\nsoon suffocated by the water, and his dead body floated about on the\r\nsurface, tied to the foot of the Frog. A Hawk observed it, and, pouncing\r\nupon it with his talons, carried it aloft. The Frog, being still\r\nfastened to the leg of the Mouse, was also carried off a prisoner, and\r\nwas eaten by the Hawk.\r\n\r\nHarm hatch, harm catch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Man Bitten by a Dog\r\n\r\nA MAN who had been bitten by a Dog went about in quest of someone who\r\nmight heal him. A friend, meeting him and learning what he wanted, said,\r\n\"If you would be cured, take a piece of bread, and dip it in the blood\r\nfrom your wound, and go and give it to the Dog that bit you.\" The Man\r\nwho had been bitten laughed at this advice and said, \"Why? If I should\r\ndo so, it would be as if I should beg every Dog in the town to bite me.\"\r\n\r\nBenefits bestowed upon the evil-disposed increase their means of\r\ninjuring you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Two Pots\r\n\r\nA RIVER carried down in its stream two Pots, one made of earthenware and\r\nthe other of brass. The Earthen Pot said to the Brass Pot, \"Pray keep\r\nat a distance and do not come near me, for if you touch me ever so\r\nslightly, I shall be broken in pieces, and besides, I by no means wish\r\nto come near you.\"\r\n\r\nEquals make the best friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wolf and the Sheep\r\n\r\nA WOLF, sorely wounded and bitten by dogs, lay sick and maimed in his\r\nlair. Being in want of food, he called to a Sheep who was passing, and\r\nasked him to fetch some water from a stream flowing close beside him.\r\n\"For,\" he said, \"if you will bring me drink, I will find means to\r\nprovide myself with meat.\" \"Yes,\" said the Sheep, \"if I should bring you\r\nthe draught, you would doubtless make me provide the meat also.\"\r\n\r\nHypocritical speeches are easily seen through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Aethiop\r\n\r\nTHE PURCHASER of a black servant was persuaded that the color of his\r\nskin arose from dirt contracted through the neglect of his former\r\nmasters. On bringing him home he resorted to every means of cleaning,\r\nand subjected the man to incessant scrubbings. The servant caught a\r\nsevere cold, but he never changed his color or complexion.\r\n\r\nWhat's bred in the bone will stick to the flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fisherman and His Nets\r\n\r\nA FISHERMAN, engaged in his calling, made a very successful cast and\r\ncaptured a great haul of fish. He managed by a skillful handling of his\r\nnet to retain all the large fish and to draw them to the shore; but he\r\ncould not prevent the smaller fish from falling back through the meshes\r\nof the net into the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Huntsman and the Fisherman\r\n\r\nA HUNTSMAN, returning with his dogs from the field, fell in by chance\r\nwith a Fisherman who was bringing home a basket well laden with fish.\r\nThe Huntsman wished to have the fish, and their owner experienced an\r\nequal longing for the contents of the game-bag. They quickly agreed to\r\nexchange the produce of their day's sport. Each was so well pleased with\r\nhis bargain that they made for some time the same exchange day after\r\nday. Finally a neighbor said to them, \"If you go on in this way, you\r\nwill soon destroy by frequent use the pleasure of your exchange, and\r\neach will again wish to retain the fruits of his own sport.\"\r\n\r\nAbstain and enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Old Woman and the Wine-Jar\r\n\r\nAN OLD WOMAN found an empty jar which had lately been full of prime old\r\nwine and which still retained the fragrant smell of its former contents.\r\nShe greedily placed it several times to her nose, and drawing it\r\nbackwards and forwards said, \"O most delicious! How nice must the\r\nWine itself have been, when it leaves behind in the very vessel which\r\ncontained it so sweet a perfume!\"\r\n\r\nThe memory of a good deed lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fox and the Crow\r\n\r\nA CROW having stolen a bit of meat, perched in a tree and held it in her\r\nbeak. A Fox, seeing this, longed to possess the meat himself, and by a\r\nwily stratagem succeeded. \"How handsome is the Crow,\" he exclaimed, \"in\r\nthe beauty of her shape and in the fairness of her complexion! Oh,\r\nif her voice were only equal to her beauty, she would deservedly be\r\nconsidered the Queen of Birds!\" This he said deceitfully; but the Crow,\r\nanxious to refute the reflection cast upon her voice, set up a loud caw\r\nand dropped the flesh. The Fox quickly picked it up, and thus addressed\r\nthe Crow: \"My good Crow, your voice is right enough, but your wit is\r\nwanting.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Two Dogs\r\n\r\nA MAN had two dogs: a Hound, trained to assist him in his sports, and a\r\nHousedog, taught to watch the house. When he returned home after a good\r\nday's sport, he always gave the Housedog a large share of his spoil. The\r\nHound, feeling much aggrieved at this, reproached his companion, saying,\r\n\"It is very hard to have all this labor, while you, who do not assist\r\nin the chase, luxuriate on the fruits of my exertions.\" The Housedog\r\nreplied, \"Do not blame me, my friend, but find fault with the master,\r\nwho has not taught me to labor, but to depend for subsistence on the\r\nlabor of others.\"\r\n\r\nChildren are not to be blamed for the faults of their parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Stag in the Ox-Stall\r\n\r\nA STAG, roundly chased by the hounds and blinded by fear to the danger\r\nhe was running into, took shelter in a farmyard and hid himself in a\r\nshed among the oxen. An Ox gave him this kindly warning: \"O unhappy\r\ncreature! why should you thus, of your own accord, incur destruction\r\nand trust yourself in the house of your enemy?\" The Stag replied: \"Only\r\nallow me, friend, to stay where I am, and I will undertake to find some\r\nfavorable opportunity of effecting my escape.\" At the approach of the\r\nevening the herdsman came to feed his cattle, but did not see the Stag;\r\nand even the farm-bailiff with several laborers passed through the\r\nshed and failed to notice him. The Stag, congratulating himself on his\r\nsafety, began to express his sincere thanks to the Oxen who had kindly\r\nhelped him in the hour of need. One of them again answered him: \"We\r\nindeed wish you well, but the danger is not over. There is one other yet\r\nto pass through the shed, who has as it were a hundred eyes, and until\r\nhe has come and gone, your life is still in peril.\" At that moment the\r\nmaster himself entered, and having had to complain that his oxen had\r\nnot been properly fed, he went up to their racks and cried out: \"Why is\r\nthere such a scarcity of fodder? There is not half enough straw for them\r\nto lie on. Those lazy fellows have not even swept the cobwebs away.\"\r\nWhile he thus examined everything in turn, he spied the tips of the\r\nantlers of the Stag peeping out of the straw. Then summoning his\r\nlaborers, he ordered that the Stag should be seized and killed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hawk, the Kite, and the Pigeons\r\n\r\nTHE PIGEONS, terrified by the appearance of a Kite, called upon the Hawk\r\nto defend them. He at once consented. When they had admitted him into\r\nthe cote, they found that he made more havoc and slew a larger number of\r\nthem in one day than the Kite could pounce upon in a whole year.\r\n\r\nAvoid a remedy that is worse than the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Widow and the Sheep\r\n\r\nA CERTAIN poor widow had one solitary Sheep. At shearing time, wishing\r\nto take his fleece and to avoid expense, she sheared him herself, but\r\nused the shears so unskillfully that with the fleece she sheared the\r\nflesh. The Sheep, writhing with pain, said, \"Why do you hurt me so,\r\nMistress? What weight can my blood add to the wool? If you want my\r\nflesh, there is the butcher, who will kill me in an instant; but if you\r\nwant my fleece and wool, there is the shearer, who will shear and not\r\nhurt me.\"\r\n\r\nThe least outlay is not always the greatest gain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wild Ass and the Lion\r\n\r\nA WILD ASS and a Lion entered into an alliance so that they might\r\ncapture the beasts of the forest with greater ease. The Lion agreed to\r\nassist the Wild Ass with his strength, while the Wild Ass gave the Lion\r\nthe benefit of his greater speed. When they had taken as many beasts as\r\ntheir necessities required, the Lion undertook to distribute the prey,\r\nand for this purpose divided it into three shares. \"I will take the\r\nfirst share,\" he said, \"because I am King: and the second share, as a\r\npartner with you in the chase: and the third share (believe me) will be\r\na source of great evil to you, unless you willingly resign it to me, and\r\nset off as fast as you can.\"\r\n\r\nMight makes right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eagle and the Arrow\r\n\r\nAN EAGLE sat on a lofty rock, watching the movements of a Hare whom he\r\nsought to make his prey. An archer, who saw the Eagle from a place of\r\nconcealment, took an accurate aim and wounded him mortally. The Eagle\r\ngave one look at the arrow that had entered his heart and saw in that\r\nsingle glance that its feathers had been furnished by himself. \"It is\r\na double grief to me,\" he exclaimed, \"that I should perish by an arrow\r\nfeathered from my own wings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sick Kite\r\n\r\nA KITE, sick unto death, said to his mother: \"O Mother! do not mourn,\r\nbut at once invoke the gods that my life may be prolonged.\" She replied,\r\n\"Alas! my son, which of the gods do you think will pity you? Is there\r\none whom you have not outraged by filching from their very altars a part\r\nof the sacrifice offered up to them?\"\r\n\r\nWe must make friends in prosperity if we would have their help in\r\nadversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion and the Dolphin\r\n\r\nA LION roaming by the seashore saw a Dolphin lift up its head out of the\r\nwaves, and suggested that they contract an alliance, saying that of all\r\nthe animals they ought to be the best friends, since the one was the\r\nking of beasts on the earth, and the other was the sovereign ruler of\r\nall the inhabitants of the ocean. The Dolphin gladly consented to this\r\nrequest. Not long afterwards the Lion had a combat with a wild bull, and\r\ncalled on the Dolphin to help him. The Dolphin, though quite willing to\r\ngive him assistance, was unable to do so, as he could not by any means\r\nreach the land. The Lion abused him as a traitor. The Dolphin replied,\r\n\"Nay, my friend, blame not me, but Nature, which, while giving me the\r\nsovereignty of the sea, has quite denied me the power of living upon the\r\nland.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion and the Boar\r\n\r\nON A SUMMER DAY, when the great heat induced a general thirst among the\r\nbeasts, a Lion and a Boar came at the same moment to a small well to\r\ndrink. They fiercely disputed which of them should drink first, and\r\nwere soon engaged in the agonies of a mortal combat. When they stopped\r\nsuddenly to catch their breath for a fiercer renewal of the fight,\r\nthey saw some Vultures waiting in the distance to feast on the one that\r\nshould fall first. They at once made up their quarrel, saying, \"It\r\nis better for us to make friends, than to become the food of Crows or\r\nVultures.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe One-Eyed Doe\r\n\r\nA DOE blind in one eye was accustomed to graze as near to the edge of\r\nthe cliff as she possibly could, in the hope of securing her greater\r\nsafety. She turned her sound eye towards the land that she might get the\r\nearliest tidings of the approach of hunter or hound, and her injured eye\r\ntowards the sea, from whence she entertained no anticipation of danger.\r\nSome boatmen sailing by saw her, and taking a successful aim, mortally\r\nwounded her. Yielding up her last breath, she gasped forth this lament:\r\n\"O wretched creature that I am! to take such precaution against the\r\nland, and after all to find this seashore, to which I had come for\r\nsafety, so much more perilous.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Shepherd and the Sea\r\n\r\nA SHEPHERD, keeping watch over his sheep near the shore, saw the\r\nSea very calm and smooth, and longed to make a voyage with a view to\r\ncommerce. He sold all his flock, invested it in a cargo of dates, and\r\nset sail. But a very great tempest came on, and the ship being in danger\r\nof sinking, he threw all his merchandise overboard, and barely escaped\r\nwith his life in the empty ship. Not long afterwards when someone passed\r\nby and observed the unruffled calm of the Sea, he interrupted him and\r\nsaid, \"It is again in want of dates, and therefore looks quiet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ass, the Cock, and the Lion\r\n\r\nAN ASS and a Cock were in a straw-yard together when a Lion, desperate\r\nfrom hunger, approached the spot. He was about to spring upon the Ass,\r\nwhen the Cock (to the sound of whose voice the Lion, it is said, has a\r\nsingular aversion) crowed loudly, and the Lion fled away as fast as he\r\ncould. The Ass, observing his trepidation at the mere crowing of a Cock\r\nsummoned courage to attack him, and galloped after him for that purpose.\r\nHe had run no long distance, when the Lion, turning about, seized him\r\nand tore him to pieces.\r\n\r\nFalse confidence often leads into danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mice and the Weasels\r\n\r\nTHE WEASELS and the Mice waged a perpetual war with each other, in\r\nwhich much blood was shed. The Weasels were always the victors. The Mice\r\nthought that the cause of their frequent defeats was that they had no\r\nleaders set apart from the general army to command them, and that they\r\nwere exposed to dangers from lack of discipline. They therefore chose as\r\nleaders Mice that were most renowned for their family descent, strength,\r\nand counsel, as well as those most noted for their courage in the fight,\r\nso that they might be better marshaled in battle array and formed into\r\ntroops, regiments, and battalions. When all this was done, and the army\r\ndisciplined, and the herald Mouse had duly proclaimed war by challenging\r\nthe Weasels, the newly chosen generals bound their heads with straws,\r\nthat they might be more conspicuous to all their troops. Scarcely had\r\nthe battle begun, when a great rout overwhelmed the Mice, who scampered\r\noff as fast as they could to their holes. The generals, not being able\r\nto get in on account of the ornaments on their heads, were all captured\r\nand eaten by the Weasels.\r\n\r\nThe more honor the more danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mice in Council\r\n\r\nTHE MICE summoned a council to decide how they might best devise means\r\nof warning themselves of the approach of their great enemy the Cat.\r\nAmong the many plans suggested, the one that found most favor was the\r\nproposal to tie a bell to the neck of the Cat, so that the Mice, being\r\nwarned by the sound of the tinkling, might run away and hide themselves\r\nin their holes at his approach. But when the Mice further debated who\r\namong them should thus \"bell the Cat,\" there was no one found to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wolf and the Housedog\r\n\r\nA WOLF, meeting a big well-fed Mastiff with a wooden collar about his\r\nneck asked him who it was that fed him so well and yet compelled him to\r\ndrag that heavy log about wherever he went. \"The master,\" he replied.\r\nThen said the Wolf: \"May no friend of mine ever be in such a plight; for\r\nthe weight of this chain is enough to spoil the appetite.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rivers and the Sea\r\n\r\nTHE RIVERS joined together to complain to the Sea, saying, \"Why is it\r\nthat when we flow into your tides so potable and sweet, you work in\r\nus such a change, and make us salty and unfit to drink?\" The Sea,\r\nperceiving that they intended to throw the blame on him, said, \"Pray\r\ncease to flow into me, and then you will not be made briny.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Playful Ass\r\n\r\nAN ASS climbed up to the roof of a building, and frisking about there,\r\nbroke in the tiling. The owner went up after him and quickly drove him\r\ndown, beating him severely with a thick wooden cudgel. The Ass said,\r\n\"Why, I saw the Monkey do this very thing yesterday, and you all laughed\r\nheartily, as if it afforded you very great amusement.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Three Tradesmen\r\n\r\nA GREAT CITY was besieged, and its inhabitants were called together to\r\nconsider the best means of protecting it from the enemy. A Bricklayer\r\nearnestly recommended bricks as affording the best material for an\r\neffective resistance. A Carpenter, with equal enthusiasm, proposed\r\ntimber as a preferable method of defense. Upon which a Currier stood up\r\nand said, \"Sirs, I differ from you altogether: there is no material\r\nfor resistance equal to a covering of hides; and nothing so good as\r\nleather.\"\r\n\r\nEvery man for himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Master and His Dogs\r\n\r\nA CERTAIN MAN, detained by a storm in his country house, first of\r\nall killed his sheep, and then his goats, for the maintenance of his\r\nhousehold. The storm still continuing, he was obliged to slaughter his\r\nyoke oxen for food. On seeing this, his Dogs took counsel together,\r\nand said, \"It is time for us to be off, for if the master spare not his\r\noxen, who work for his gain, how can we expect him to spare us?\"\r\n\r\nHe is not to be trusted as a friend who mistreats his own family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wolf and the Shepherds\r\n\r\nA WOLF, passing by, saw some Shepherds in a hut eating a haunch of\r\nmutton for their dinner. Approaching them, he said, \"What a clamor you\r\nwould raise if I were to do as you are doing!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dolphins, the Whales, and the Sprat\r\n\r\nTHE DOLPHINS and Whales waged a fierce war with each other. When the\r\nbattle was at its height, a Sprat lifted its head out of the waves and\r\nsaid that he would reconcile their differences if they would accept\r\nhim as an umpire. One of the Dolphins replied, \"We would far rather be\r\ndestroyed in our battle with each other than admit any interference from\r\nyou in our affairs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ass Carrying the Image\r\n\r\nAN ASS once carried through the streets of a city a famous wooden Image,\r\nto be placed in one of its Temples. As he passed along, the crowd made\r\nlowly prostration before the Image. The Ass, thinking that they bowed\r\ntheir heads in token of respect for himself, bristled up with pride,\r\ngave himself airs, and refused to move another step. The driver, seeing\r\nhim thus stop, laid his whip lustily about his shoulders and said, \"O\r\nyou perverse dull-head! it is not yet come to this, that men pay worship\r\nto an Ass.\"\r\n\r\nThey are not wise who give to themselves the credit due to others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Two Travelers and the Axe\r\n\r\nTWO MEN were journeying together. One of them picked up an axe that\r\nlay upon the path, and said, \"I have found an axe.\" \"Nay, my friend,\"\r\nreplied the other, \"do not say 'I,' but 'We' have found an axe.\" They\r\nhad not gone far before they saw the owner of the axe pursuing them, and\r\nhe who had picked up the axe said, \"We are undone.\" \"Nay,\" replied the\r\nother, \"keep to your first mode of speech, my friend; what you thought\r\nright then, think right now. Say 'I,' not 'We' are undone.\"\r\n\r\nHe who shares the danger ought to share the prize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Old Lion\r\n\r\nA LION, worn out with years and powerless from disease, lay on the\r\nground at the point of death. A Boar rushed upon him, and avenged with\r\na stroke of his tusks a long-remembered injury. Shortly afterwards the\r\nBull with his horns gored him as if he were an enemy. When the Ass saw\r\nthat the huge beast could be assailed with impunity, he let drive at\r\nhis forehead with his heels. The expiring Lion said, \"I have reluctantly\r\nbrooked the insults of the brave, but to be compelled to endure such\r\ntreatment from thee, a disgrace to Nature, is indeed to die a double\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Old Hound\r\n\r\nA HOUND, who in the days of his youth and strength had never yielded to\r\nany beast of the forest, encountered in his old age a boar in the chase.\r\nHe seized him boldly by the ear, but could not retain his hold because\r\nof the decay of his teeth, so that the boar escaped. His master, quickly\r\ncoming up, was very much disappointed, and fiercely abused the dog. The\r\nHound looked up and said, \"It was not my fault master: my spirit was as\r\ngood as ever, but I could not help my infirmities. I rather deserve to\r\nbe praised for what I have been, than to be blamed for what I am.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bee and Jupiter\r\n\r\nA BEE from Mount Hymettus, the queen of the hive, ascended to Olympus to\r\npresent Jupiter some honey fresh from her combs. Jupiter, delighted with\r\nthe offering of honey, promised to give whatever she should ask. She\r\ntherefore besought him, saying, \"Give me, I pray thee, a sting, that if\r\nany mortal shall approach to take my honey, I may kill him.\" Jupiter was\r\nmuch displeased, for he loved the race of man, but could not refuse the\r\nrequest because of his promise. He thus answered the Bee: \"You shall\r\nhave your request, but it will be at the peril of your own life. For if\r\nyou use your sting, it shall remain in the wound you make, and then you\r\nwill die from the loss of it.\"\r\n\r\nEvil wishes, like chickens, come home to roost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Milk-Woman and Her Pail\r\n\r\nA FARMER'S daughter was carrying her Pail of milk from the field to the\r\nfarmhouse, when she fell a-musing. \"The money for which this milk will\r\nbe sold, will buy at least three hundred eggs. The eggs, allowing for\r\nall mishaps, will produce two hundred and fifty chickens. The chickens\r\nwill become ready for the market when poultry will fetch the highest\r\nprice, so that by the end of the year I shall have money enough from\r\nmy share to buy a new gown. In this dress I will go to the Christmas\r\nparties, where all the young fellows will propose to me, but I will toss\r\nmy head and refuse them every one.\" At this moment she tossed her head\r\nin unison with her thoughts, when down fell the milk pail to the ground,\r\nand all her imaginary schemes perished in a moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Seaside Travelers\r\n\r\nSOME TRAVELERS, journeying along the seashore, climbed to the summit of\r\na tall cliff, and looking over the sea, saw in the distance what they\r\nthought was a large ship. They waited in the hope of seeing it enter\r\nthe harbor, but as the object on which they looked was driven nearer to\r\nshore by the wind, they found that it could at the most be a small boat,\r\nand not a ship. When however it reached the beach, they discovered\r\nthat it was only a large faggot of sticks, and one of them said to\r\nhis companions, \"We have waited for no purpose, for after all there is\r\nnothing to see but a load of wood.\"\r\n\r\nOur mere anticipations of life outrun its realities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Brazier and His Dog\r\n\r\nA BRAZIER had a little Dog, which was a great favorite with his master,\r\nand his constant companion. While he hammered away at his metals the Dog\r\nslept; but when, on the other hand, he went to dinner and began to eat,\r\nthe Dog woke up and wagged his tail, as if he would ask for a share of\r\nhis meal. His master one day, pretending to be angry and shaking his\r\nstick at him, said, \"You wretched little sluggard! what shall I do to\r\nyou? While I am hammering on the anvil, you sleep on the mat; and when\r\nI begin to eat after my toil, you wake up and wag your tail for food. Do\r\nyou not know that labor is the source of every blessing, and that none\r\nbut those who work are entitled to eat?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ass and His Shadow\r\n\r\nA TRAVELER hired an Ass to convey him to a distant place. The day being\r\nintensely hot, and the sun shining in its strength, the Traveler stopped\r\nto rest, and sought shelter from the heat under the Shadow of the Ass.\r\nAs this afforded only protection for one, and as the Traveler and the\r\nowner of the Ass both claimed it, a violent dispute arose between them\r\nas to which of them had the right to the Shadow. The owner maintained\r\nthat he had let the Ass only, and not his Shadow. The Traveler asserted\r\nthat he had, with the hire of the Ass, hired his Shadow also. The\r\nquarrel proceeded from words to blows, and while the men fought, the Ass\r\ngalloped off.\r\n\r\nIn quarreling about the shadow we often lose the substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ass and His Masters\r\n\r\nAN ASS, belonging to an herb-seller who gave him too little food and\r\ntoo much work made a petition to Jupiter to be released from his present\r\nservice and provided with another master. Jupiter, after warning him\r\nthat he would repent his request, caused him to be sold to a tile-maker.\r\nShortly afterwards, finding that he had heavier loads to carry and\r\nharder work in the brick-field, he petitioned for another change of\r\nmaster. Jupiter, telling him that it would be the last time that he\r\ncould grant his request, ordained that he be sold to a tanner. The\r\nAss found that he had fallen into worse hands, and noting his master's\r\noccupation, said, groaning: \"It would have been better for me to have\r\nbeen either starved by the one, or to have been overworked by the other\r\nof my former masters, than to have been bought by my present owner, who\r\nwill even after I am dead tan my hide, and make me useful to him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Oak and the Reeds\r\n\r\nA VERY LARGE OAK was uprooted by the wind and thrown across a stream. It\r\nfell among some Reeds, which it thus addressed: \"I wonder how you, who\r\nare so light and weak, are not entirely crushed by these strong winds.\"\r\nThey replied, \"You fight and contend with the wind, and consequently you\r\nare destroyed; while we on the contrary bend before the least breath of\r\nair, and therefore remain unbroken, and escape.\"\r\n\r\nStoop to conquer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fisherman and the Little Fish\r\n\r\nA FISHERMAN who lived on the produce of his nets, one day caught a\r\nsingle small Fish as the result of his day's labor. The Fish, panting\r\nconvulsively, thus entreated for his life: \"O Sir, what good can I be to\r\nyou, and how little am I worth? I am not yet come to my full size. Pray\r\nspare my life, and put me back into the sea. I shall soon become a large\r\nfish fit for the tables of the rich, and then you can catch me again,\r\nand make a handsome profit of me.\" The Fisherman replied, \"I should\r\nindeed be a very simple fellow if, for the chance of a greater uncertain\r\nprofit, I were to forego my present certain gain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hunter and the Woodman\r\n\r\nA HUNTER, not very bold, was searching for the tracks of a Lion. He\r\nasked a man felling oaks in the forest if he had seen any marks of his\r\nfootsteps or knew where his lair was. \"I will,\" said the man, \"at once\r\nshow you the Lion himself.\" The Hunter, turning very pale and chattering\r\nwith his teeth from fear, replied, \"No, thank you. I did not ask that;\r\nit is his track only I am in search of, not the Lion himself.\"\r\n\r\nThe hero is brave in deeds as well as words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wild Boar and the Fox\r\n\r\nA WILD BOAR stood under a tree and rubbed his tusks against the trunk. A\r\nFox passing by asked him why he thus sharpened his teeth when there was\r\nno danger threatening from either huntsman or hound. He replied, \"I do\r\nit advisedly; for it would never do to have to sharpen my weapons just\r\nat the time I ought to be using them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion in a Farmyard\r\n\r\nA LION entered a farmyard. The Farmer, wishing to catch him, shut the\r\ngate. When the Lion found that he could not escape, he flew upon the\r\nsheep and killed them, and then attacked the oxen. The Farmer, beginning\r\nto be alarmed for his own safety, opened the gate and released the Lion.\r\nOn his departure the Farmer grievously lamented the destruction of his\r\nsheep and oxen, but his wife, who had been a spectator to all that took\r\nplace, said, \"On my word, you are rightly served, for how could you for\r\na moment think of shutting up a Lion along with you in your farmyard\r\nwhen you know that you shake in your shoes if you only hear his roar at\r\na distance?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMercury and the Sculptor\r\n\r\nMERCURY ONCE DETERMINED to learn in what esteem he was held among\r\nmortals. For this purpose he assumed the character of a man and visited\r\nin this disguise a Sculptor's studio having looked at various statues,\r\nhe demanded the price of two figures of Jupiter and Juno. When the sum\r\nat which they were valued was named, he pointed to a figure of himself,\r\nsaying to the Sculptor, \"You will certainly want much more for this, as\r\nit is the statue of the Messenger of the Gods, and author of all your\r\ngain.\" The Sculptor replied, \"Well, if you will buy these, I'll fling\r\nyou that into the bargain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Swan and the Goose\r\n\r\nA CERTAIN rich man bought in the market a Goose and a Swan. He fed the\r\none for his table and kept the other for the sake of its song. When the\r\ntime came for killing the Goose, the cook went to get him at night, when\r\nit was dark, and he was not able to distinguish one bird from the other.\r\nBy mistake he caught the Swan instead of the Goose. The Swan, threatened\r\nwith death, burst forth into song and thus made himself known by his\r\nvoice, and preserved his life by his melody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Swollen Fox\r\n\r\nA VERY HUNGRY FOX, seeing some bread and meat left by shepherds in the\r\nhollow of an oak, crept into the hole and made a hearty meal. When he\r\nfinished, he was so full that he was not able to get out, and began to\r\ngroan and lament his fate. Another Fox passing by heard his cries, and\r\ncoming up, inquired the cause of his complaining. On learning what had\r\nhappened, he said to him, \"Ah, you will have to remain there, my friend,\r\nuntil you become such as you were when you crept in, and then you will\r\neasily get out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fox and the Woodcutter\r\n\r\nA FOX, running before the hounds, came across a Woodcutter felling\r\nan oak and begged him to show him a safe hiding-place. The Woodcutter\r\nadvised him to take shelter in his own hut, so the Fox crept in and\r\nhid himself in a corner. The huntsman soon came up with his hounds and\r\ninquired of the Woodcutter if he had seen the Fox. He declared that he\r\nhad not seen him, and yet pointed, all the time he was speaking, to the\r\nhut where the Fox lay hidden. The huntsman took no notice of the signs,\r\nbut believing his word, hastened forward in the chase. As soon as\r\nthey were well away, the Fox departed without taking any notice of the\r\nWoodcutter: whereon he called to him and reproached him, saying, \"You\r\nungrateful fellow, you owe your life to me, and yet you leave me without\r\na word of thanks.\" The Fox replied, \"Indeed, I should have thanked you\r\nfervently if your deeds had been as good as your words, and if your\r\nhands had not been traitors to your speech.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Birdcatcher, the Partridge, and the Cock\r\n\r\nA BIRDCATCHER was about to sit down to a dinner of herbs when a friend\r\nunexpectedly came in. The bird-trap was quite empty, as he had caught\r\nnothing, and he had to kill a pied Partridge, which he had tamed for\r\na decoy. The bird entreated earnestly for his life: \"What would you do\r\nwithout me when next you spread your nets? Who would chirp you to sleep,\r\nor call for you the covey of answering birds?\" The Birdcatcher spared\r\nhis life, and determined to pick out a fine young Cock just attaining to\r\nhis comb. But the Cock expostulated in piteous tones from his perch: \"If\r\nyou kill me, who will announce to you the appearance of the dawn? Who\r\nwill wake you to your daily tasks or tell you when it is time to visit\r\nthe bird-trap in the morning?\" He replied, \"What you say is true. You\r\nare a capital bird at telling the time of day. But my friend and I must\r\nhave our dinners.\"\r\n\r\nNecessity knows no law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Monkey and the Fishermen\r\n\r\nA MONKEY perched upon a lofty tree saw some Fishermen casting their\r\nnets into a river, and narrowly watched their proceedings. The Fishermen\r\nafter a while gave up fishing, and on going home to dinner left their\r\nnets upon the bank. The Monkey, who is the most imitative of animals,\r\ndescended from the treetop and endeavored to do as they had done. Having\r\nhandled the net, he threw it into the river, but became tangled in\r\nthe meshes and drowned. With his last breath he said to himself, \"I am\r\nrightly served; for what business had I who had never handled a net to\r\ntry and catch fish?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Flea and the Wrestler\r\n\r\nA FLEA settled upon the bare foot of a Wrestler and bit him, causing the\r\nman to call loudly upon Hercules for help. When the Flea a second time\r\nhopped upon his foot, he groaned and said, \"O Hercules! if you will\r\nnot help me against a Flea, how can I hope for your assistance against\r\ngreater antagonists?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Two Frogs\r\n\r\nTWO FROGS dwelt in the same pool. When the pool dried up under the\r\nsummer's heat, they left it and set out together for another home. As\r\nthey went along they chanced to pass a deep well, amply supplied with\r\nwater, and when they saw it, one of the Frogs said to the other, \"Let us\r\ndescend and make our abode in this well: it will furnish us with shelter\r\nand food.\" The other replied with greater caution, \"But suppose the\r\nwater should fail us. How can we get out again from so great a depth?\"\r\n\r\nDo nothing without a regard to the consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cat and the Mice\r\n\r\nA CERTAIN HOUSE was overrun with Mice. A Cat, discovering this, made\r\nher way into it and began to catch and eat them one by one. Fearing for\r\ntheir lives, the Mice kept themselves close in their holes. The Cat was\r\nno longer able to get at them and perceived that she must tempt them\r\nforth by some device. For this purpose she jumped upon a peg, and\r\nsuspending herself from it, pretended to be dead. One of the Mice,\r\npeeping stealthily out, saw her and said, \"Ah, my good madam, even\r\nthough you should turn into a meal-bag, we will not come near you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion, the Bear, and the Fox\r\n\r\nA LION and a Bear seized a Kid at the same moment, and fought fiercely\r\nfor its possession. When they had fearfully lacerated each other and\r\nwere faint from the long combat, they lay down exhausted with fatigue. A\r\nFox, who had gone round them at a distance several times, saw them both\r\nstretched on the ground with the Kid lying untouched in the middle. He\r\nran in between them, and seizing the Kid scampered off as fast as he\r\ncould. The Lion and the Bear saw him, but not being able to get up,\r\nsaid, \"Woe be to us, that we should have fought and belabored ourselves\r\nonly to serve the turn of a Fox.\"\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that one man has all the toil, and another all the\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Doe and the Lion\r\n\r\nA DOE hard pressed by hunters sought refuge in a cave belonging to a\r\nLion. The Lion concealed himself on seeing her approach, but when she\r\nwas safe within the cave, sprang upon her and tore her to pieces. \"Woe\r\nis me,\" exclaimed the Doe, \"who have escaped from man, only to throw\r\nmyself into the mouth of a wild beast?\"\r\n\r\nIn avoiding one evil, care must be taken not to fall into another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Farmer and the Fox\r\n\r\nA FARMER, who bore a grudge against a Fox for robbing his poultry yard,\r\ncaught him at last, and being determined to take an ample revenge, tied\r\nsome rope well soaked in oil to his tail, and set it on fire. The Fox by\r\na strange fatality rushed to the fields of the Farmer who had captured\r\nhim. It was the time of the wheat harvest; but the Farmer reaped nothing\r\nthat year and returned home grieving sorely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Seagull and the Kite\r\n\r\nA SEAGULL having bolted down too large a fish, burst its deep gullet-bag\r\nand lay down on the shore to die. A Kite saw him and exclaimed: \"You\r\nrichly deserve your fate; for a bird of the air has no business to seek\r\nits food from the sea.\"\r\n\r\nEvery man should be content to mind his own business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher, the Ants, and Mercury\r\n\r\nA PHILOSOPHER witnessed from the shore the shipwreck of a vessel, of\r\nwhich the crew and passengers were all drowned. He inveighed against\r\nthe injustice of Providence, which would for the sake of one criminal\r\nperchance sailing in the ship allow so many innocent persons to perish.\r\nAs he was indulging in these reflections, he found himself surrounded\r\nby a whole army of Ants, near whose nest he was standing. One of them\r\nclimbed up and stung him, and he immediately trampled them all to death\r\nwith his foot. Mercury presented himself, and striking the Philosopher\r\nwith his wand, said, \"And are you indeed to make yourself a judge of\r\nthe dealings of Providence, who hast thyself in a similar manner treated\r\nthese poor Ants?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mouse and the Bull\r\n\r\nA BULL was bitten by a Mouse and, angered by the wound, tried to capture\r\nhim. But the Mouse reached his hole in safety. Though the Bull dug into\r\nthe walls with his horns, he tired before he could rout out the Mouse,\r\nand crouching down, went to sleep outside the hole. The Mouse peeped\r\nout, crept furtively up his flank, and again biting him, retreated to\r\nhis hole. The Bull rising up, and not knowing what to do, was sadly\r\nperplexed. At which the Mouse said, \"The great do not always prevail.\r\nThere are times when the small and lowly are the strongest to do\r\nmischief.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion and the Hare\r\n\r\nA LION came across a Hare, who was fast asleep. He was just in the act\r\nof seizing her, when a fine young Hart trotted by, and he left the Hare\r\nto follow him. The Hare, scared by the noise, awoke and scudded away.\r\nThe Lion was unable after a long chase to catch the Hart, and returned\r\nto feed upon the Hare. On finding that the Hare also had run off, he\r\nsaid, \"I am rightly served, for having let go of the food that I had in\r\nmy hand for the chance of obtaining more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Peasant and the Eagle\r\n\r\nA PEASANT found an Eagle captured in a trap, and much admiring the bird,\r\nset him free. The Eagle did not prove ungrateful to his deliverer, for\r\nseeing the Peasant sitting under a wall which was not safe, he flew\r\ntoward him and with his talons snatched a bundle from his head. When the\r\nPeasant rose in pursuit, the Eagle let the bundle fall again. Taking\r\nit up, the man returned to the same place, to find that the wall under\r\nwhich he had been sitting had fallen to pieces; and he marveled at the\r\nservice rendered him by the Eagle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Image of Mercury and the Carpenter\r\n\r\nA VERY POOR MAN, a Carpenter by trade, had a wooden image of Mercury,\r\nbefore which he made offerings day by day, and begged the idol to make\r\nhim rich, but in spite of his entreaties he became poorer and poorer.\r\nAt last, being very angry, he took his image down from its pedestal and\r\ndashed it against the wall. When its head was knocked off, out came a\r\nstream of gold, which the Carpenter quickly picked up and said, \"Well,\r\nI think thou art altogether contradictory and unreasonable; for when I\r\npaid you honor, I reaped no benefits: but now that I maltreat you I am\r\nloaded with an abundance of riches.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bull and the Goat\r\n\r\nA BULL, escaping from a Lion, hid in a cave which some shepherds had\r\nrecently occupied. As soon as he entered, a He-Goat left in the cave\r\nsharply attacked him with his horns. The Bull quietly addressed him:\r\n\"Butt away as much as you will. I have no fear of you, but of the\r\nLion. Let that monster go away and I will soon let you know what is the\r\nrespective strength of a Goat and a Bull.\"\r\n\r\nIt shows an evil disposition to take advantage of a friend in distress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dancing Monkeys\r\n\r\nA PRINCE had some Monkeys trained to dance. Being naturally great mimics\r\nof men's actions, they showed themselves most apt pupils, and when\r\narrayed in their rich clothes and masks, they danced as well as any of\r\nthe courtiers. The spectacle was often repeated with great applause,\r\ntill on one occasion a courtier, bent on mischief, took from his pocket\r\na handful of nuts and threw them upon the stage. The Monkeys at the\r\nsight of the nuts forgot their dancing and became (as indeed they were)\r\nMonkeys instead of actors. Pulling off their masks and tearing their\r\nrobes, they fought with one another for the nuts. The dancing spectacle\r\nthus came to an end amidst the laughter and ridicule of the audience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fox and the Leopard\r\n\r\nTHE FOX and the Leopard disputed which was the more beautiful of the\r\ntwo. The Leopard exhibited one by one the various spots which decorated\r\nhis skin. But the Fox, interrupting him, said, \"And how much more\r\nbeautiful than you am I, who am decorated, not in body, but in mind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Monkeys and Their Mother\r\n\r\nTHE MONKEY, it is said, has two young ones at each birth. The Mother\r\nfondles one and nurtures it with the greatest affection and care, but\r\nhates and neglects the other. It happened once that the young one which\r\nwas caressed and loved was smothered by the too great affection of the\r\nMother, while the despised one was nurtured and reared in spite of the\r\nneglect to which it was exposed.\r\n\r\nThe best intentions will not always ensure success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Oaks and Jupiter\r\n\r\nTHE OAKS presented a complaint to Jupiter, saying, \"We bear for no\r\npurpose the burden of life, as of all the trees that grow we are the\r\nmost continually in peril of the axe.\" Jupiter made answer: \"You have\r\nonly to thank yourselves for the misfortunes to which you are exposed:\r\nfor if you did not make such excellent pillars and posts, and prove\r\nyourselves so serviceable to the carpenters and the farmers, the axe\r\nwould not so frequently be laid to your roots.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hare and the Hound\r\n\r\nA HOUND started a Hare from his lair, but after a long run, gave up the\r\nchase. A goat-herd seeing him stop, mocked him, saying \"The little one\r\nis the best runner of the two.\" The Hound replied, \"You do not see the\r\ndifference between us: I was only running for a dinner, but he for his\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Traveler and Fortune\r\n\r\nA TRAVELER wearied from a long journey lay down, overcome with fatigue,\r\non the very brink of a deep well. Just as he was about to fall into the\r\nwater, Dame Fortune, it is said, appeared to him and waking him from\r\nhis slumber thus addressed him: \"Good Sir, pray wake up: for if you fall\r\ninto the well, the blame will be thrown on me, and I shall get an\r\nill name among mortals; for I find that men are sure to impute their\r\ncalamities to me, however much by their own folly they have really\r\nbrought them on themselves.\"\r\n\r\nEveryone is more or less master of his own fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bald Knight\r\n\r\nA BALD KNIGHT, who wore a wig, went out to hunt. A sudden puff of wind\r\nblew off his hat and wig, at which a loud laugh rang forth from his\r\ncompanions. He pulled up his horse, and with great glee joined in the\r\njoke by saying, \"What a marvel it is that hairs which are not mine\r\nshould fly from me, when they have forsaken even the man on whose head\r\nthey grew.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Shepherd and the Dog\r\n\r\nA SHEPHERD penning his sheep in the fold for the night was about to shut\r\nup a wolf with them, when his Dog perceiving the wolf said, \"Master, how\r\ncan you expect the sheep to be safe if you admit a wolf into the fold?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lamp\r\n\r\nA LAMP, soaked with too much oil and flaring brightly, boasted that it\r\ngave more light than the sun. Then a sudden puff of wind arose, and the\r\nLamp was immediately extinguished. Its owner lit it again, and said:\r\n\"Boast no more, but henceforth be content to give thy light in silence.\r\nKnow that not even the stars need to be relit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion, the Fox, and the Ass\r\n\r\nTHE LION, the Fox and the Ass entered into an agreement to assist each\r\nother in the chase. Having secured a large booty, the Lion on their\r\nreturn from the forest asked the Ass to allot his due portion to each\r\nof the three partners in the treaty. The Ass carefully divided the spoil\r\ninto three equal shares and modestly requested the two others to make\r\nthe first choice. The Lion, bursting out into a great rage, devoured the\r\nAss. Then he requested the Fox to do him the favor to make a division.\r\nThe Fox accumulated all that they had killed into one large heap and\r\nleft to himself the smallest possible morsel. The Lion said, \"Who has\r\ntaught you, my very excellent fellow, the art of division? You are\r\nperfect to a fraction.\" He replied, \"I learned it from the Ass, by\r\nwitnessing his fate.\"\r\n\r\nHappy is the man who learns from the misfortunes of others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bull, the Lioness, and the Wild-Boar Hunter\r\n\r\nA BULL finding a lion's cub asleep gored him to death with his horns.\r\nThe Lioness came up, and bitterly lamented the death of her whelp. A\r\nwild-boar Hunter, seeing her distress, stood at a distance and said to\r\nher, \"Think how many men there are who have reason to lament the loss of\r\ntheir children, whose deaths have been caused by you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Oak and the Woodcutters\r\n\r\nTHE WOODCUTTER cut down a Mountain Oak and split it in pieces, making\r\nwedges of its own branches for dividing the trunk. The Oak said with a\r\nsigh, \"I do not care about the blows of the axe aimed at my roots, but\r\nI do grieve at being torn in pieces by these wedges made from my own\r\nbranches.\"\r\n\r\nMisfortunes springing from ourselves are the hardest to bear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hen and the Golden Eggs\r\n\r\nA COTTAGER and his wife had a Hen that laid a golden egg every day. They\r\nsupposed that the Hen must contain a great lump of gold in its inside,\r\nand in order to get the gold they killed it. Having done so, they found\r\nto their surprise that the Hen differed in no respect from their other\r\nhens. The foolish pair, thus hoping to become rich all at once, deprived\r\nthemselves of the gain of which they were assured day by day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ass and the Frogs\r\n\r\nAN ASS, carrying a load of wood, passed through a pond. As he was\r\ncrossing through the water he lost his footing, stumbled and fell, and\r\nnot being able to rise on account of his load, groaned heavily. Some\r\nFrogs frequenting the pool heard his lamentation, and said, \"What would\r\nyou do if you had to live here always as we do, when you make such a\r\nfuss about a mere fall into the water?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMen often bear little grievances with less courage than they do large\r\nmisfortunes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crow and the Raven\r\n\r\nA CROW was jealous of the Raven, because he was considered a bird of\r\ngood omen and always attracted the attention of men, who noted by his\r\nflight the good or evil course of future events. Seeing some travelers\r\napproaching, the Crow flew up into a tree, and perching herself on one\r\nof the branches, cawed as loudly as she could. The travelers turned\r\ntowards the sound and wondered what it foreboded, when one of them said\r\nto his companion, \"Let us proceed on our journey, my friend, for it is\r\nonly the caw of a crow, and her cry, you know, is no omen.\"\r\n\r\nThose who assume a character which does not belong to them, only make\r\nthemselves ridiculous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Trees and the Axe\r\n\r\nA MAN came into a forest and asked the Trees to provide him a handle\r\nfor his axe. The Trees consented to his request and gave him a young\r\nash-tree. No sooner had the man fitted a new handle to his axe from it,\r\nthan he began to use it and quickly felled with his strokes the\r\nnoblest giants of the forest. An old oak, lamenting when too late the\r\ndestruction of his companions, said to a neighboring cedar, \"The first\r\nstep has lost us all. If we had not given up the rights of the ash, we\r\nmight yet have retained our own privileges and have stood for ages.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crab and the Fox\r\n\r\nA CRAB, forsaking the seashore, chose a neighboring green meadow as its\r\nfeeding ground. A Fox came across him, and being very hungry ate him\r\nup. Just as he was on the point of being eaten, the Crab said, \"I well\r\ndeserve my fate, for what business had I on the land, when by my nature\r\nand habits I am only adapted for the sea?\"\r\n\r\nContentment with our lot is an element of happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Woman and Her Hen\r\n\r\nA WOMAN possessed a Hen that gave her an egg every day. She often\r\npondered how she might obtain two eggs daily instead of one, and at\r\nlast, to gain her purpose, determined to give the Hen a double allowance\r\nof barley. From that day the Hen became fat and sleek, and never once\r\nlaid another egg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ass and the Old Shepherd\r\n\r\nA SHEPHERD, watching his Ass feeding in a meadow, was alarmed all of\r\na sudden by the cries of the enemy. He appealed to the Ass to fly with\r\nhim, lest they should both be captured, but the animal lazily replied,\r\n\"Why should I, pray? Do you think it likely the conqueror will place on\r\nme two sets of panniers?\" \"No,\" rejoined the Shepherd. \"Then,\" said\r\nthe Ass, \"as long as I carry the panniers, what matters it to me whom I\r\nserve?\"\r\n\r\nIn a change of government the poor change nothing beyond the name of\r\ntheir master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kites and the Swans\r\n\r\nTEE KITES of olden times, as well as the Swans, had the privilege of\r\nsong. But having heard the neigh of the horse, they were so enchanted\r\nwith the sound, that they tried to imitate it; and, in trying to neigh,\r\nthey forgot how to sing.\r\n\r\nThe desire for imaginary benefits often involves the loss of present\r\nblessings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wolves and the Sheepdogs\r\n\r\nTHE WOLVES thus addressed the Sheepdogs: \"Why should you, who are like\r\nus in so many things, not be entirely of one mind with us, and live with\r\nus as brothers should? We differ from you in one point only. We live in\r\nfreedom, but you bow down to and slave for men, who in return for your\r\nservices flog you with whips and put collars on your necks. They make\r\nyou also guard their sheep, and while they eat the mutton throw only\r\nthe bones to you. If you will be persuaded by us, you will give us the\r\nsheep, and we will enjoy them in common, till we all are surfeited.\" The\r\nDogs listened favorably to these proposals, and, entering the den of the\r\nWolves, they were set upon and torn to pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hares and the Foxes\r\n\r\nTHE HARES waged war with the Eagles, and called upon the Foxes to help\r\nthem. They replied, \"We would willingly have helped you, if we had not\r\nknown who you were, and with whom you were fighting.\"\r\n\r\nCount the cost before you commit yourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bowman and Lion\r\n\r\nA VERY SKILLFUL BOWMAN went to the mountains in search of game, but all\r\nthe beasts of the forest fled at his approach. The Lion alone challenged\r\nhim to combat. The Bowman immediately shot out an arrow and said to the\r\nLion: \"I send thee my messenger, that from him thou mayest learn what\r\nI myself shall be when I assail thee.\" The wounded Lion rushed away in\r\ngreat fear, and when a Fox who had seen it all happen told him to be of\r\ngood courage and not to back off at the first attack he replied: \"You\r\ncounsel me in vain; for if he sends so fearful a messenger, how shall I\r\nabide the attack of the man himself?\"\r\n\r\nBe on guard against men who can strike from a distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Camel\r\n\r\nWHEN MAN first saw the Camel, he was so frightened at his vast size that\r\nhe ran away. After a time, perceiving the meekness and gentleness of\r\nthe beast's temper, he summoned courage enough to approach him. Soon\r\nafterwards, observing that he was an animal altogether deficient in\r\nspirit, he assumed such boldness as to put a bridle in his mouth, and to\r\nlet a child drive him.\r\n\r\nUse serves to overcome dread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wasp and the Snake\r\n\r\nA WASP seated himself upon the head of a Snake and, striking him\r\nunceasingly with his stings, wounded him to death. The Snake, being in\r\ngreat torment and not knowing how to rid himself of his enemy, saw a\r\nwagon heavily laden with wood, and went and purposely placed his\r\nhead under the wheels, saying, \"At least my enemy and I shall perish\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dog and the Hare\r\n\r\nA HOUND having started a Hare on the hillside pursued her for some\r\ndistance, at one time biting her with his teeth as if he would take her\r\nlife, and at another fawning upon her, as if in play with another dog.\r\nThe Hare said to him, \"I wish you would act sincerely by me, and show\r\nyourself in your true colors. If you are a friend, why do you bite me so\r\nhard? If an enemy, why do you fawn on me?\"\r\n\r\nNo one can be a friend if you know not whether to trust or distrust him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bull and the Calf\r\n\r\nA BULL was striving with all his might to squeeze himself through a\r\nnarrow passage which led to his stall. A young Calf came up, and offered\r\nto go before and show him the way by which he could manage to pass.\r\n\"Save yourself the trouble,\" said the Bull; \"I knew that way long before\r\nyou were born.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Stag, the Wolf, and the Sheep\r\n\r\nA STAG asked a Sheep to lend him a measure of wheat, and said that the\r\nWolf would be his surety. The Sheep, fearing some fraud was intended,\r\nexcused herself, saying, \"The Wolf is accustomed to seize what he wants\r\nand to run off; and you, too, can quickly outstrip me in your rapid\r\nflight. How then shall I be able to find you, when the day of payment\r\ncomes?\"\r\n\r\nTwo blacks do not make one white.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Peacock and the Crane\r\n\r\nA PEACOCK spreading its gorgeous tail mocked a Crane that passed by,\r\nridiculing the ashen hue of its plumage and saying, \"I am robed, like\r\na king, in gold and purple and all the colors of the rainbow; while you\r\nhave not a bit of color on your wings.\" \"True,\" replied the Crane; \"but\r\nI soar to the heights of heaven and lift up my voice to the stars, while\r\nyou walk below, like a cock, among the birds of the dunghill.\"\r\n\r\nFine feathers don't make fine birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fox and the Hedgehog\r\n\r\nA FOX swimming across a rapid river was carried by the force of the\r\ncurrent into a very deep ravine, where he lay for a long time very much\r\nbruised, sick, and unable to move. A swarm of hungry blood-sucking flies\r\nsettled upon him. A Hedgehog, passing by, saw his anguish and inquired\r\nif he should drive away the flies that were tormenting him. \"By no\r\nmeans,\" replied the Fox; \"pray do not molest them.\" \"How is this?\" said\r\nthe Hedgehog; \"do you not want to be rid of them?\" \"No,\" returned the\r\nFox, \"for these flies which you see are full of blood, and sting me but\r\nlittle, and if you rid me of these which are already satiated, others\r\nmore hungry will come in their place, and will drink up all the blood I\r\nhave left.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eagle, the Cat, and the Wild Sow\r\n\r\nAN EAGLE made her nest at the top of a lofty oak; a Cat, having found\r\na convenient hole, moved into the middle of the trunk; and a Wild Sow,\r\nwith her young, took shelter in a hollow at its foot. The Cat cunningly\r\nresolved to destroy this chance-made colony. To carry out her design,\r\nshe climbed to the nest of the Eagle, and said, \"Destruction is\r\npreparing for you, and for me too, unfortunately. The Wild Sow, whom you\r\nsee daily digging up the earth, wishes to uproot the oak, so she may\r\non its fall seize our families as food for her young.\" Having thus\r\nfrightened the Eagle out of her senses, she crept down to the cave of\r\nthe Sow, and said, \"Your children are in great danger; for as soon\r\nas you go out with your litter to find food, the Eagle is prepared to\r\npounce upon one of your little pigs.\" Having instilled these fears into\r\nthe Sow, she went and pretended to hide herself in the hollow of the\r\ntree. When night came she went forth with silent foot and obtained\r\nfood for herself and her kittens, but feigning to be afraid, she kept a\r\nlookout all through the day. Meanwhile, the Eagle, full of fear of the\r\nSow, sat still on the branches, and the Sow, terrified by the Eagle, did\r\nnot dare to go out from her cave. And thus they both, along with their\r\nfamilies, perished from hunger, and afforded ample provision for the Cat\r\nand her kittens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Thief and the Innkeeper\r\n\r\nA THIEF hired a room in a tavern and stayed a while in the hope of\r\nstealing something which should enable him to pay his reckoning. When he\r\nhad waited some days in vain, he saw the Innkeeper dressed in a new and\r\nhandsome coat and sitting before his door. The Thief sat down beside him\r\nand talked with him. As the conversation began to flag, the Thief yawned\r\nterribly and at the same time howled like a wolf. The Innkeeper said,\r\n\"Why do you howl so fearfully?\" \"I will tell you,\" said the Thief, \"but\r\nfirst let me ask you to hold my clothes, or I shall tear them to pieces.\r\nI know not, sir, when I got this habit of yawning, nor whether these\r\nattacks of howling were inflicted on me as a judgment for my crimes, or\r\nfor any other cause; but this I do know, that when I yawn for the third\r\ntime, I actually turn into a wolf and attack men.\" With this speech he\r\ncommenced a second fit of yawning and again howled like a wolf, as he\r\nhad at first. The Innkeeper, hearing his tale and believing what he\r\nsaid, became greatly alarmed and, rising from his seat, attempted to run\r\naway. The Thief laid hold of his coat and entreated him to stop, saying,\r\n\"Pray wait, sir, and hold my clothes, or I shall tear them to pieces\r\nin my fury, when I turn into a wolf.\" At the same moment he yawned the\r\nthird time and set up a terrible howl. The Innkeeper, frightened lest\r\nhe should be attacked, left his new coat in the Thief's hand and ran as\r\nfast as he could into the inn for safety. The Thief made off with the\r\ncoat and did not return again to the inn.\r\n\r\nEvery tale is not to be believed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mule\r\n\r\nA MULE, frolicsome from lack of work and from too much corn, galloped\r\nabout in a very extravagant manner, and said to himself: \"My father\r\nsurely was a high-mettled racer, and I am his own child in speed and\r\nspirit.\" On the next day, being driven a long journey, and feeling\r\nvery wearied, he exclaimed in a disconsolate tone: \"I must have made a\r\nmistake; my father, after all, could have been only an ass.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hart and the Vine\r\n\r\nA HART, hard pressed in the chase, hid himself beneath the large leaves\r\nof a Vine. The huntsmen, in their haste, overshot the place of his\r\nconcealment. Supposing all danger to have passed, the Hart began to\r\nnibble the tendrils of the Vine. One of the huntsmen, attracted by the\r\nrustling of the leaves, looked back, and seeing the Hart, shot an arrow\r\nfrom his bow and struck it. The Hart, at the point of death, groaned: \"I\r\nam rightly served, for I should not have maltreated the Vine that saved\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Serpent and the Eagle\r\n\r\nA SERPENT and an Eagle were struggling with each other in deadly\r\nconflict. The Serpent had the advantage, and was about to strangle the\r\nbird. A countryman saw them, and running up, loosed the coil of the\r\nSerpent and let the Eagle go free. The Serpent, irritated at the\r\nescape of his prey, injected his poison into the drinking horn of the\r\ncountryman. The rustic, ignorant of his danger, was about to drink, when\r\nthe Eagle struck his hand with his wing, and, seizing the drinking horn\r\nin his talons, carried it aloft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crow and the Pitcher\r\n\r\nA CROW perishing with thirst saw a pitcher, and hoping to find water,\r\nflew to it with delight. When he reached it, he discovered to his grief\r\nthat it contained so little water that he could not possibly get at it.\r\nHe tried everything he could think of to reach the water, but all his\r\nefforts were in vain. At last he collected as many stones as he could\r\ncarry and dropped them one by one with his beak into the pitcher, until\r\nhe brought the water within his reach and thus saved his life.\r\n\r\nNecessity is the mother of invention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Two Frogs\r\n\r\nTWO FROGS were neighbors. One inhabited a deep pond, far removed from\r\npublic view; the other lived in a gully containing little water, and\r\ntraversed by a country road. The Frog that lived in the pond warned his\r\nfriend to change his residence and entreated him to come and live with\r\nhim, saying that he would enjoy greater safety from danger and more\r\nabundant food. The other refused, saying that he felt it so very hard to\r\nleave a place to which he had become accustomed. A few days afterwards a\r\nheavy wagon passed through the gully and crushed him to death under its\r\nwheels.\r\n\r\nA willful man will have his way to his own hurt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wolf and the Fox\r\n\r\nAT ONE TIME a very large and strong Wolf was born among the wolves, who\r\nexceeded all his fellow-wolves in strength, size, and swiftness, so that\r\nthey unanimously decided to call him \"Lion.\" The Wolf, with a lack of\r\nsense proportioned to his enormous size, thought that they gave him this\r\nname in earnest, and, leaving his own race, consorted exclusively with\r\nthe lions. An old sly Fox, seeing this, said, \"May I never make myself\r\nso ridiculous as you do in your pride and self-conceit; for even though\r\nyou have the size of a lion among wolves, in a herd of lions you are\r\ndefinitely a wolf.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Walnut-Tree\r\n\r\nA WALNUT TREE standing by the roadside bore an abundant crop of fruit.\r\nFor the sake of the nuts, the passers-by broke its branches with stones\r\nand sticks. The Walnut-Tree piteously exclaimed, \"O wretched me! that\r\nthose whom I cheer with my fruit should repay me with these painful\r\nrequitals!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Gnat and the Lion\r\n\r\nA GNAT came and said to a Lion, \"I do not in the least fear you, nor are\r\nyou stronger than I am. For in what does your strength consist? You\r\ncan scratch with your claws and bite with your teeth an a woman in her\r\nquarrels. I repeat that I am altogether more powerful than you; and if\r\nyou doubt it, let us fight and see who will conquer.\" The Gnat, having\r\nsounded his horn, fastened himself upon the Lion and stung him on the\r\nnostrils and the parts of the face devoid of hair. While trying to crush\r\nhim, the Lion tore himself with his claws, until he punished himself\r\nseverely. The Gnat thus prevailed over the Lion, and, buzzing about in\r\na song of triumph, flew away. But shortly afterwards he became entangled\r\nin the meshes of a cobweb and was eaten by a spider. He greatly lamented\r\nhis fate, saying, \"Woe is me! that I, who can wage war successfully\r\nwith the hugest beasts, should perish myself from this spider, the most\r\ninconsiderable of insects!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Monkey and the Dolphin\r\n\r\nA SAILOR, bound on a long voyage, took with him a Monkey to amuse him\r\nwhile on shipboard. As he sailed off the coast of Greece, a violent\r\ntempest arose in which the ship was wrecked and he, his Monkey, and all\r\nthe crew were obliged to swim for their lives. A Dolphin saw the Monkey\r\ncontending with the waves, and supposing him to be a man (whom he is\r\nalways said to befriend), came and placed himself under him, to convey\r\nhim on his back in safety to the shore. When the Dolphin arrived with\r\nhis burden in sight of land not far from Athens, he asked the Monkey\r\nif he were an Athenian. The latter replied that he was, and that he was\r\ndescended from one of the most noble families in that city. The Dolphin\r\nthen inquired if he knew the Piraeus (the famous harbor of Athens).\r\nSupposing that a man was meant, the Monkey answered that he knew him\r\nvery well and that he was an intimate friend. The Dolphin, indignant at\r\nthese falsehoods, dipped the Monkey under the water and drowned him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Jackdaw and the Doves\r\n\r\nA JACKDAW, seeing some Doves in a cote abundantly provided with food,\r\npainted himself white and joined them in order to share their plentiful\r\nmaintenance. The Doves, as long as he was silent, supposed him to be one\r\nof themselves and admitted him to their cote. But when one day he forgot\r\nhimself and began to chatter, they discovered his true character and\r\ndrove him forth, pecking him with their beaks. Failing to obtain food\r\namong the Doves, he returned to the Jackdaws. They too, not recognizing\r\nhim on account of his color, expelled him from living with them. So\r\ndesiring two ends, he obtained neither.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Horse and the Stag\r\n\r\nAT ONE TIME the Horse had the plain entirely to himself. Then a Stag\r\nintruded into his domain and shared his pasture. The Horse, desiring to\r\nrevenge himself on the stranger, asked a man if he were willing to\r\nhelp him in punishing the Stag. The man replied that if the Horse would\r\nreceive a bit in his mouth and agree to carry him, he would contrive\r\neffective weapons against the Stag. The Horse consented and allowed\r\nthe man to mount him. From that hour he found that instead of obtaining\r\nrevenge on the Stag, he had enslaved himself to the service of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kid and the Wolf\r\n\r\nA KID, returning without protection from the pasture, was pursued by a\r\nWolf. Seeing he could not escape, he turned round, and said: \"I know,\r\nfriend Wolf, that I must be your prey, but before I die I would ask of\r\nyou one favor you will play me a tune to which I may dance.\" The Wolf\r\ncomplied, and while he was piping and the Kid was dancing, some hounds\r\nhearing the sound ran up and began chasing the Wolf. Turning to the\r\nKid, he said, \"It is just what I deserve; for I, who am only a butcher,\r\nshould not have turned piper to please you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prophet\r\n\r\nA WIZARD, sitting in the marketplace, was telling the fortunes of the\r\npassers-by when a person ran up in great haste, and announced to him\r\nthat the doors of his house had been broken open and that all his goods\r\nwere being stolen. He sighed heavily and hastened away as fast as he\r\ncould run. A neighbor saw him running and said, \"Oh! you fellow there!\r\nyou say you can foretell the fortunes of others; how is it you did not\r\nforesee your own?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fox and the Monkey\r\n\r\nA FOX and a Monkey were traveling together on the same road. As they\r\njourneyed, they passed through a cemetery full of monuments. \"All these\r\nmonuments which you see,\" said the Monkey, \"are erected in honor of my\r\nancestors, who were in their day freedmen and citizens of great renown.\"\r\nThe Fox replied, \"You have chosen a most appropriate subject for\r\nyour falsehoods, as I am sure none of your ancestors will be able to\r\ncontradict you.\"\r\n\r\nA false tale often betrays itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Thief and the Housedog\r\n\r\nA THIEF came in the night to break into a house. He brought with him\r\nseveral slices of meat in order to pacify the Housedog, so that he would\r\nnot alarm his master by barking. As the Thief threw him the pieces of\r\nmeat, the Dog said, \"If you think to stop my mouth, you will be greatly\r\nmistaken. This sudden kindness at your hands will only make me more\r\nwatchful, lest under these unexpected favors to myself, you have some\r\nprivate ends to accomplish for your own benefit, and for my master's\r\ninjury.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Man, the Horse, the Ox, and the Dog\r\n\r\nA HORSE, Ox, and Dog, driven to great straits by the cold, sought\r\nshelter and protection from Man. He received them kindly, lighted a\r\nfire, and warmed them. He let the Horse make free with his oats, gave\r\nthe Ox an abundance of hay, and fed the Dog with meat from his own\r\ntable. Grateful for these favors, the animals determined to repay him\r\nto the best of their ability. For this purpose, they divided the term\r\nof his life between them, and each endowed one portion of it with the\r\nqualities which chiefly characterized himself. The Horse chose his\r\nearliest years and gave them his own attributes: hence every man is in\r\nhis youth impetuous, headstrong, and obstinate in maintaining his own\r\nopinion. The Ox took under his patronage the next term of life, and\r\ntherefore man in his middle age is fond of work, devoted to labor, and\r\nresolute to amass wealth and to husband his resources. The end of life\r\nwas reserved for the Dog, wherefore the old man is often snappish,\r\nirritable, hard to please, and selfish, tolerant only of his own\r\nhousehold, but averse to strangers and to all who do not administer to\r\nhis comfort or to his necessities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Apes and the Two Travelers\r\n\r\nTWO MEN, one who always spoke the truth and the other who told nothing\r\nbut lies, were traveling together and by chance came to the land of\r\nApes. One of the Apes, who had raised himself to be king, commanded them\r\nto be seized and brought before him, that he might know what was said of\r\nhim among men. He ordered at the same time that all the Apes be arranged\r\nin a long row on his right hand and on his left, and that a throne be\r\nplaced for him, as was the custom among men. After these preparations\r\nhe signified that the two men should be brought before him, and greeted\r\nthem with this salutation: \"What sort of a king do I seem to you to be,\r\nO strangers?\" The Lying Traveler replied, \"You seem to me a most mighty\r\nking.\" \"And what is your estimate of those you see around me?\" \"These,\"\r\nhe made answer, \"are worthy companions of yourself, fit at least to be\r\nambassadors and leaders of armies.\" The Ape and all his court, gratified\r\nwith the lie, commanded that a handsome present be given to the\r\nflatterer. On this the truthful Traveler thought to himself, \"If so\r\ngreat a reward be given for a lie, with what gift may not I be rewarded,\r\nif, according to my custom, I tell the truth?\" The Ape quickly turned\r\nto him. \"And pray how do I and these my friends around me seem to you?\"\r\n\"Thou art,\" he said, \"a most excellent Ape, and all these thy companions\r\nafter thy example are excellent Apes too.\" The King of the Apes, enraged\r\nat hearing these truths, gave him over to the teeth and claws of his\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wolf and the Shepherd\r\n\r\nA WOLF followed a flock of sheep for a long time and did not attempt\r\nto injure one of them. The Shepherd at first stood on his guard against\r\nhim, as against an enemy, and kept a strict watch over his movements.\r\nBut when the Wolf, day after day, kept in the company of the sheep and\r\ndid not make the slightest effort to seize them, the Shepherd began to\r\nlook upon him as a guardian of his flock rather than as a plotter of\r\nevil against it; and when occasion called him one day into the city,\r\nhe left the sheep entirely in his charge. The Wolf, now that he had the\r\nopportunity, fell upon the sheep, and destroyed the greater part of\r\nthe flock. When the Shepherd returned to find his flock destroyed, he\r\nexclaimed: \"I have been rightly served; why did I trust my sheep to a\r\nWolf?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hares and the Lions\r\n\r\nTHE HARES harangued the assembly, and argued that all should be equal.\r\nThe Lions made this reply: \"Your words, O Hares! are good; but they lack\r\nboth claws and teeth such as we have.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lark and Her Young Ones\r\n\r\nA LARK had made her nest in the early spring on the young green wheat.\r\nThe brood had almost grown to their full strength and attained the use\r\nof their wings and the full plumage of their feathers, when the owner of\r\nthe field, looking over his ripe crop, said, \"The time has come when I\r\nmust ask all my neighbors to help me with my harvest.\" One of the young\r\nLarks heard his speech and related it to his mother, inquiring of her\r\nto what place they should move for safety. \"There is no occasion to move\r\nyet, my son,\" she replied; \"the man who only sends to his friends to\r\nhelp him with his harvest is not really in earnest.\" The owner of the\r\nfield came again a few days later and saw the wheat shedding the grain\r\nfrom excess of ripeness. He said, \"I will come myself tomorrow with my\r\nlaborers, and with as many reapers as I can hire, and will get in the\r\nharvest.\" The Lark on hearing these words said to her brood, \"It is time\r\nnow to be off, my little ones, for the man is in earnest this time; he\r\nno longer trusts his friends, but will reap the field himself.\"\r\n\r\nSelf-help is the best help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fox and the Lion\r\n\r\nWHEN A FOX who had never yet seen a Lion, fell in with him by chance for\r\nthe first time in the forest, he was so frightened that he nearly\r\ndied with fear. On meeting him for the second time, he was still much\r\nalarmed, but not to the same extent as at first. On seeing him the third\r\ntime, he so increased in boldness that he went up to him and commenced a\r\nfamiliar conversation with him.\r\n\r\nAcquaintance softens prejudices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Weasel and the Mice\r\n\r\nA WEASEL, inactive from age and infirmities, was not able to catch mice\r\nas he once did. He therefore rolled himself in flour and lay down in a\r\ndark corner. A Mouse, supposing him to be food, leaped upon him, and was\r\ninstantly caught and squeezed to death. Another perished in a similar\r\nmanner, and then a third, and still others after them. A very old Mouse,\r\nwho had escaped many a trap and snare, observed from a safe distance\r\nthe trick of his crafty foe and said, \"Ah! you that lie there, may you\r\nprosper just in the same proportion as you are what you pretend to be!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Boy Bathing\r\n\r\nA BOY bathing in a river was in danger of being drowned. He called out\r\nto a passing traveler for help, but instead of holding out a helping\r\nhand, the man stood by unconcernedly, and scolded the boy for his\r\nimprudence. \"Oh, sir!\" cried the youth, \"pray help me now and scold me\r\nafterwards.\"\r\n\r\nCounsel without help is useless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ass and the Wolf\r\n\r\nAN ASS feeding in a meadow saw a Wolf approaching to seize him, and\r\nimmediately pretended to be lame. The Wolf, coming up, inquired the\r\ncause of his lameness. The Ass replied that passing through a hedge he\r\nhad trod with his foot upon a sharp thorn. He requested that the Wolf\r\npull it out, lest when he ate him it should injure his throat. The Wolf\r\nconsented and lifted up the foot, and was giving his whole mind to the\r\ndiscovery of the thorn, when the Ass, with his heels, kicked his teeth\r\ninto his mouth and galloped away. The Wolf, being thus fearfully mauled,\r\nsaid, \"I am rightly served, for why did I attempt the art of healing,\r\nwhen my father only taught me the trade of a butcher?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Seller of Images\r\n\r\nA CERTAIN MAN made a wooden image of Mercury and offered it for sale.\r\nWhen no one appeared willing to buy it, in order to attract purchasers,\r\nhe cried out that he had the statue to sell of a benefactor who bestowed\r\nwealth and helped to heap up riches. One of the bystanders said to him,\r\n\"My good fellow, why do you sell him, being such a one as you describe,\r\nwhen you may yourself enjoy the good things he has to give?\" \"Why,\" he\r\nreplied, \"I am in need of immediate help, and he is wont to give his\r\ngood gifts very slowly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fox and the Grapes\r\n\r\nA FAMISHED FOX saw some clusters of ripe black grapes hanging from\r\na trellised vine. She resorted to all her tricks to get at them, but\r\nwearied herself in vain, for she could not reach them. At last she\r\nturned away, hiding her disappointment and saying: \"The Grapes are sour,\r\nand not ripe as I thought.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Man and His Wife\r\n\r\nA MAN had a Wife who made herself hated by all the members of his\r\nhousehold. Wishing to find out if she had the same effect on the persons\r\nin her father's house, he made some excuse to send her home on a visit\r\nto her father. After a short time she returned, and when he inquired how\r\nshe had got on and how the servants had treated her, she replied, \"The\r\nherdsmen and shepherds cast on me looks of aversion.\" He said, \"O Wife,\r\nif you were disliked by those who go out early in the morning with their\r\nflocks and return late in the evening, what must have been felt towards\r\nyou by those with whom you passed the whole day!\"\r\n\r\nStraws show how the wind blows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Peacock and Juno\r\n\r\nTHE PEACOCK made complaint to Juno that, while the nightingale pleased\r\nevery ear with his song, he himself no sooner opened his mouth than he\r\nbecame a laughingstock to all who heard him. The Goddess, to console\r\nhim, said, \"But you far excel in beauty and in size. The splendor of the\r\nemerald shines in your neck and you unfold a tail gorgeous with painted\r\nplumage.\" \"But for what purpose have I,\" said the bird, \"this dumb\r\nbeauty so long as I am surpassed in song?\" \"The lot of each,\" replied\r\nJuno, \"has been assigned by the will of the Fates--to thee, beauty; to\r\nthe eagle, strength; to the nightingale, song; to the raven, favorable,\r\nand to the crow, unfavorable auguries. These are all contented with the\r\nendowments allotted to them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hawk and the Nightingale\r\n\r\nA NIGHTINGALE, sitting aloft upon an oak and singing according to his\r\nwont, was seen by a Hawk who, being in need of food, swooped down and\r\nseized him. The Nightingale, about to lose his life, earnestly begged\r\nthe Hawk to let him go, saying that he was not big enough to satisfy\r\nthe hunger of a Hawk who, if he wanted food, ought to pursue the larger\r\nbirds. The Hawk, interrupting him, said: \"I should indeed have lost\r\nmy senses if I should let go food ready in my hand, for the sake of\r\npursuing birds which are not yet even within sight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dog, the Cock, and the Fox\r\n\r\nA DOG and a Cock being great friends, agreed to travel together. At\r\nnightfall they took shelter in a thick wood. The Cock flying up, perched\r\nhimself on the branches of a tree, while the Dog found a bed beneath in\r\nthe hollow trunk. When the morning dawned, the Cock, as usual, crowed\r\nvery loudly several times. A Fox heard the sound, and wishing to make\r\na breakfast on him, came and stood under the branches, saying how\r\nearnestly he desired to make the acquaintance of the owner of so\r\nmagnificent a voice. The Cock, suspecting his civilities, said: \"Sir, I\r\nwish you would do me the favor of going around to the hollow trunk below\r\nme, and waking my porter, so that he may open the door and let you in.\"\r\nWhen the Fox approached the tree, the Dog sprang out and caught him, and\r\ntore him to pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wolf and the Goat\r\n\r\nA WOLF saw a Goat feeding at the summit of a steep precipice, where he\r\nhad no chance of reaching her. He called to her and earnestly begged her\r\nto come lower down, lest she fall by some mishap; and he added that the\r\nmeadows lay where he was standing, and that the herbage was most tender.\r\nShe replied, \"No, my friend, it is not for the pasture that you invite\r\nme, but for yourself, who are in want of food.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion and the Bull\r\n\r\nA LION, greatly desiring to capture a Bull, and yet afraid to attack\r\nhim on account of his great size, resorted to a trick to ensure his\r\ndestruction. He approached the Bull and said, \"I have slain a fine\r\nsheep, my friend; and if you will come home and partake of him with me,\r\nI shall be delighted to have your company.\" The Lion said this in the\r\nhope that, as the Bull was in the act of reclining to eat, he might\r\nattack him to advantage, and make his meal on him. The Bull, on\r\napproaching the Lion's den, saw the huge spits and giant caldrons, and\r\nno sign whatever of the sheep, and, without saying a word, quietly took\r\nhis departure. The Lion inquired why he went off so abruptly without\r\na word of salutation to his host, who had not given him any cause for\r\noffense. \"I have reasons enough,\" said the Bull. \"I see no indication\r\nwhatever of your having slaughtered a sheep, while I do see very plainly\r\nevery preparation for your dining on a bull.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Goat and the Ass\r\n\r\nA MAN once kept a Goat and an Ass. The Goat, envying the Ass on account\r\nof his greater abundance of food, said, \"How shamefully you are\r\ntreated: at one time grinding in the mill, and at another carrying heavy\r\nburdens;\" and he further advised him to pretend to be epileptic and\r\nfall into a ditch and so obtain rest. The Ass listened to his words, and\r\nfalling into a ditch, was very much bruised. His master, sending for a\r\nleech, asked his advice. He bade him pour upon the wounds the lungs of a\r\nGoat. They at once killed the Goat, and so healed the Ass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Town Mouse and the Country Mouse\r\n\r\nA COUNTRY MOUSE invited a Town Mouse, an intimate friend, to pay him\r\na visit and partake of his country fare. As they were on the bare\r\nplowlands, eating there wheat-stocks and roots pulled up from the\r\nhedgerow, the Town Mouse said to his friend, \"You live here the life of\r\nthe ants, while in my house is the horn of plenty. I am surrounded by\r\nevery luxury, and if you will come with me, as I wish you would, you\r\nshall have an ample share of my dainties.\" The Country Mouse was easily\r\npersuaded, and returned to town with his friend. On his arrival, the\r\nTown Mouse placed before him bread, barley, beans, dried figs, honey,\r\nraisins, and, last of all, brought a dainty piece of cheese from a\r\nbasket. The Country Mouse, being much delighted at the sight of such\r\ngood cheer, expressed his satisfaction in warm terms and lamented his\r\nown hard fate. Just as they were beginning to eat, someone opened the\r\ndoor, and they both ran off squeaking, as fast as they could, to a hole\r\nso narrow that two could only find room in it by squeezing. They had\r\nscarcely begun their repast again when someone else entered to take\r\nsomething out of a cupboard, whereupon the two Mice, more frightened\r\nthan before, ran away and hid themselves. At last the Country Mouse,\r\nalmost famished, said to his friend: \"Although you have prepared for\r\nme so dainty a feast, I must leave you to enjoy it by yourself. It is\r\nsurrounded by too many dangers to please me. I prefer my bare plowlands\r\nand roots from the hedgerow, where I can live in safety, and without\r\nfear.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wolf, the Fox, and the Ape\r\n\r\nA WOLF accused a Fox of theft, but the Fox entirely denied the charge.\r\nAn Ape undertook to adjudge the matter between them. When each had fully\r\nstated his case the Ape announced this sentence: \"I do not think you,\r\nWolf, ever lost what you claim; and I do believe you, Fox, to have\r\nstolen what you so stoutly deny.\"\r\n\r\nThe dishonest, if they act honestly, get no credit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fly and the Draught-Mule\r\n\r\nA FLY sat on the axle-tree of a chariot, and addressing the Draught-Mule\r\nsaid, \"How slow you are! Why do you not go faster? See if I do not prick\r\nyour neck with my sting.\" The Draught-Mule replied, \"I do not heed your\r\nthreats; I only care for him who sits above you, and who quickens my\r\npace with his whip, or holds me back with the reins. Away, therefore,\r\nwith your insolence, for I know well when to go fast, and when to go\r\nslow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fishermen\r\n\r\nSOME FISHERMEN were out trawling their nets. Perceiving them to be very\r\nheavy, they danced about for joy and supposed that they had taken a\r\nlarge catch. When they had dragged the nets to the shore they found but\r\nfew fish: the nets were full of sand and stones, and the men were beyond\r\nmeasure cast down so much at the disappointment which had befallen them,\r\nbut because they had formed such very different expectations. One of\r\ntheir company, an old man, said, \"Let us cease lamenting, my mates, for,\r\nas it seems to me, sorrow is always the twin sister of joy; and it was\r\nonly to be looked for that we, who just now were over-rejoiced, should\r\nnext have something to make us sad.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion and the Three Bulls\r\n\r\nTHREE BULLS for a long time pastured together. A Lion lay in ambush in\r\nthe hope of making them his prey, but was afraid to attack them while\r\nthey kept together. Having at last by guileful speeches succeeded in\r\nseparating them, he attacked them without fear as they fed alone, and\r\nfeasted on them one by one at his own leisure.\r\n\r\nUnion is strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fowler and the Viper\r\n\r\nA FOWLER, taking his bird-lime and his twigs, went out to catch birds.\r\nSeeing a thrush sitting upon a tree, he wished to take it, and fitting\r\nhis twigs to a proper length, watched intently, having his whole\r\nthoughts directed towards the sky. While thus looking upwards, he\r\nunknowingly trod upon a Viper asleep just before his feet. The Viper,\r\nturning about, stung him, and falling into a swoon, the man said to\r\nhimself, \"Woe is me! that while I purposed to hunt another, I am myself\r\nfallen unawares into the snares of death.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Horse and the Ass\r\n\r\nA HORSE, proud of his fine trappings, met an Ass on the highway. The\r\nAss, being heavily laden, moved slowly out of the way. \"Hardly,\" said\r\nthe Horse, \"can I resist kicking you with my heels.\" The Ass held his\r\npeace, and made only a silent appeal to the justice of the gods. Not\r\nlong afterwards the Horse, having become broken-winded, was sent by his\r\nowner to the farm. The Ass, seeing him drawing a dungcart, thus derided\r\nhim: \"Where, O boaster, are now all thy gay trappings, thou who are\r\nthyself reduced to the condition you so lately treated with contempt?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fox and the Mask\r\n\r\nA FOX entered the house of an actor and, rummaging through all his\r\nproperties, came upon a Mask, an admirable imitation of a human head. He\r\nplaced his paws on it and said, \"What a beautiful head! Yet it is of no\r\nvalue, as it entirely lacks brains.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Geese and the Cranes\r\n\r\nTHE GEESE and the Cranes were feeding in the same meadow, when a\r\nbirdcatcher came to ensnare them in his nets. The Cranes, being light of\r\nwing, fled away at his approach; while the Geese, being slower of flight\r\nand heavier in their bodies, were captured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Blind Man and the Whelp\r\n\r\nA BLIND MAN was accustomed to distinguishing different animals by\r\ntouching them with his hands. The whelp of a Wolf was brought him, with\r\na request that he would feel it, and say what it was. He felt it, and\r\nbeing in doubt, said: \"I do not quite know whether it is the cub of a\r\nFox, or the whelp of a Wolf, but this I know full well. It would not be\r\nsafe to admit him to the sheepfold.\"\r\n\r\nEvil tendencies are shown in early life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dogs and the Fox\r\n\r\nSOME DOGS, finding the skin of a lion, began to tear it in pieces with\r\ntheir teeth. A Fox, seeing them, said, \"If this lion were alive, you\r\nwould soon find out that his claws were stronger than your teeth.\"\r\n\r\nIt is easy to kick a man that is down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cobbler Turned Doctor\r\n\r\nA COBBLER unable to make a living by his trade and made desperate by\r\npoverty, began to practice medicine in a town in which he was not known.\r\nHe sold a drug, pretending that it was an antidote to all poisons,\r\nand obtained a great name for himself by long-winded puffs and\r\nadvertisements. When the Cobbler happened to fall sick himself of a\r\nserious illness, the Governor of the town determined to test his skill.\r\nFor this purpose he called for a cup, and while filling it with water,\r\npretended to mix poison with the Cobbler's antidote, commanding him\r\nto drink it on the promise of a reward. The Cobbler, under the fear of\r\ndeath, confessed that he had no knowledge of medicine, and was only made\r\nfamous by the stupid clamors of the crowd. The Governor then called a\r\npublic assembly and addressed the citizens: \"Of what folly have you been\r\nguilty? You have not hesitated to entrust your heads to a man, whom no\r\none could employ to make even the shoes for their feet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wolf and the Horse\r\n\r\nA WOLF coming out of a field of oats met a Horse and thus addressed\r\nhim: \"I would advise you to go into that field. It is full of fine oats,\r\nwhich I have left untouched for you, as you are a friend whom I would\r\nlove to hear enjoying good eating.\" The Horse replied, \"If oats had been\r\nthe food of wolves, you would never have indulged your ears at the cost\r\nof your belly.\"\r\n\r\nMen of evil reputation, when they perform a good deed, fail to get\r\ncredit for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Brother and the Sister\r\n\r\nA FATHER had one son and one daughter, the former remarkable for his\r\ngood looks, the latter for her extraordinary ugliness. While they were\r\nplaying one day as children, they happened by chance to look together\r\ninto a mirror that was placed on their mother's chair. The boy\r\ncongratulated himself on his good looks; the girl grew angry, and could\r\nnot bear the self-praises of her Brother, interpreting all he said (and\r\nhow could she do otherwise?) into reflection on herself. She ran off to\r\nher father, to be avenged on her Brother, and spitefully accused him\r\nof having, as a boy, made use of that which belonged only to girls.\r\nThe father embraced them both, and bestowing his kisses and affection\r\nimpartially on each, said, \"I wish you both would look into the mirror\r\nevery day: you, my son, that you may not spoil your beauty by evil\r\nconduct; and you, my daughter, that you may make up for your lack of\r\nbeauty by your virtues.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wasps, the Partridges, and the Farmer\r\n\r\nTHE WASPS and the Partridges, overcome with thirst, came to a Farmer and\r\nbesought him to give them some water to drink. They promised amply to\r\nrepay him the favor which they asked. The Partridges declared that they\r\nwould dig around his vines and make them produce finer grapes. The Wasps\r\nsaid that they would keep guard and drive off thieves with their stings.\r\nBut the Farmer interrupted them, saying: \"I have already two oxen, who,\r\nwithout making any promises, do all these things. It is surely better\r\nfor me to give the water to them than to you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crow and Mercury\r\n\r\nA CROW caught in a snare prayed to Apollo to release him, making a vow\r\nto offer some frankincense at his shrine. But when rescued from his\r\ndanger, he forgot his promise. Shortly afterwards, again caught in\r\na snare, he passed by Apollo and made the same promise to offer\r\nfrankincense to Mercury. Mercury soon appeared and said to him, \"O thou\r\nmost base fellow? how can I believe thee, who hast disowned and wronged\r\nthy former patron?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe North Wind and the Sun\r\n\r\nTHE NORTH WIND and the Sun disputed as to which was the most powerful,\r\nand agreed that he should be declared the victor who could first strip\r\na wayfaring man of his clothes. The North Wind first tried his power\r\nand blew with all his might, but the keener his blasts, the closer the\r\nTraveler wrapped his cloak around him, until at last, resigning all hope\r\nof victory, the Wind called upon the Sun to see what he could do. The\r\nSun suddenly shone out with all his warmth. The Traveler no sooner felt\r\nhis genial rays than he took off one garment after another, and at last,\r\nfairly overcome with heat, undressed and bathed in a stream that lay in\r\nhis path.\r\n\r\nPersuasion is better than Force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Two Men Who Were Enemies\r\n\r\nTWO MEN, deadly enemies to each other, were sailing in the same vessel.\r\nDetermined to keep as far apart as possible, the one seated himself in\r\nthe stem, and the other in the prow of the ship. A violent storm arose,\r\nand with the vessel in great danger of sinking, the one in the stern\r\ninquired of the pilot which of the two ends of the ship would go down\r\nfirst. On his replying that he supposed it would be the prow, the Man\r\nsaid, \"Death would not be grievous to me, if I could only see my Enemy\r\ndie before me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Gamecocks and the Partridge\r\n\r\nA MAN had two Gamecocks in his poultry-yard. One day by chance he found\r\na tame Partridge for sale. He purchased it and brought it home to\r\nbe reared with his Gamecocks. When the Partridge was put into the\r\npoultry-yard, they struck at it and followed it about, so that the\r\nPartridge became grievously troubled and supposed that he was thus\r\nevilly treated because he was a stranger. Not long afterwards he saw the\r\nCocks fighting together and not separating before one had well beaten\r\nthe other. He then said to himself, \"I shall no longer distress myself\r\nat being struck at by these Gamecocks, when I see that they cannot even\r\nrefrain from quarreling with each other.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Quack Frog\r\n\r\nA FROG once upon a time came forth from his home in the marsh and\r\nproclaimed to all the beasts that he was a learned physician, skilled\r\nin the use of drugs and able to heal all diseases. A Fox asked him, \"How\r\ncan you pretend to prescribe for others, when you are unable to heal\r\nyour own lame gait and wrinkled skin?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion, the Wolf, and the Fox\r\n\r\nA LION, growing old, lay sick in his cave. All the beasts came to visit\r\ntheir king, except the Fox. The Wolf therefore, thinking that he had\r\na capital opportunity, accused the Fox to the Lion of not paying any\r\nrespect to him who had the rule over them all and of not coming to visit\r\nhim. At that very moment the Fox came in and heard these last words of\r\nthe Wolf. The Lion roaring out in a rage against him, the Fox sought an\r\nopportunity to defend himself and said, \"And who of all those who have\r\ncome to you have benefited you so much as I, who have traveled from\r\nplace to place in every direction, and have sought and learnt from the\r\nphysicians the means of healing you?\" The Lion commanded him immediately\r\nto tell him the cure, when he replied, \"You must flay a wolf alive\r\nand wrap his skin yet warm around you.\" The Wolf was at once taken and\r\nflayed; whereon the Fox, turning to him, said with a smile, \"You should\r\nhave moved your master not to ill, but to good, will.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dog's House\r\n\r\nIN THE WINTERTIME, a Dog curled up in as small a space as possible on\r\naccount of the cold, determined to make himself a house. However when\r\nthe summer returned again, he lay asleep stretched at his full length\r\nand appeared to himself to be of a great size. Now he considered that\r\nit would be neither an easy nor a necessary work to make himself such a\r\nhouse as would accommodate him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wolf and the Lion\r\n\r\nROAMING BY the mountainside at sundown, a Wolf saw his own shadow become\r\ngreatly extended and magnified, and he said to himself, \"Why should I,\r\nbeing of such an immense size and extending nearly an acre in length,\r\nbe afraid of the Lion? Ought I not to be acknowledged as King of all\r\nthe collected beasts?\" While he was indulging in these proud thoughts,\r\na Lion fell upon him and killed him. He exclaimed with a too late\r\nrepentance, \"Wretched me! this overestimation of myself is the cause of\r\nmy destruction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Birds, the Beasts, and the Bat\r\n\r\nTHE BIRDS waged war with the Beasts, and each were by turns the\r\nconquerors. A Bat, fearing the uncertain issues of the fight, always\r\nfought on the side which he felt was the strongest. When peace was\r\nproclaimed, his deceitful conduct was apparent to both combatants.\r\nTherefore being condemned by each for his treachery, he was driven\r\nforth from the light of day, and henceforth concealed himself in dark\r\nhiding-places, flying always alone and at night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spendthrift and the Swallow\r\n\r\nA YOUNG MAN, a great spendthrift, had run through all his patrimony and\r\nhad but one good cloak left. One day he happened to see a Swallow, which\r\nhad appeared before its season, skimming along a pool and twittering\r\ngaily. He supposed that summer had come, and went and sold his cloak.\r\nNot many days later, winter set in again with renewed frost and cold.\r\nWhen he found the unfortunate Swallow lifeless on the ground, he\r\nsaid, \"Unhappy bird! what have you done? By thus appearing before the\r\nspringtime you have not only killed yourself, but you have wrought my\r\ndestruction also.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fox and the Lion\r\n\r\nA FOX saw a Lion confined in a cage, and standing near him, bitterly\r\nreviled him. The Lion said to the Fox, \"It is not thou who revilest me;\r\nbut this mischance which has befallen me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Owl and the Birds\r\n\r\nAN OWL, in her wisdom, counseled the Birds that when the acorn first\r\nbegan to sprout, to pull it all up out of the ground and not allow it\r\nto grow. She said acorns would produce mistletoe, from which an\r\nirremediable poison, the bird-lime, would be extracted and by which they\r\nwould be captured. The Owl next advised them to pluck up the seed of the\r\nflax, which men had sown, as it was a plant which boded no good to them.\r\nAnd, lastly, the Owl, seeing an archer approach, predicted that this\r\nman, being on foot, would contrive darts armed with feathers which would\r\nfly faster than the wings of the Birds themselves. The Birds gave no\r\ncredence to these warning words, but considered the Owl to be beside\r\nherself and said that she was mad. But afterwards, finding her words\r\nwere true, they wondered at her knowledge and deemed her to be the\r\nwisest of birds. Hence it is that when she appears they look to her\r\nas knowing all things, while she no longer gives them advice, but in\r\nsolitude laments their past folly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Trumpeter Taken Prisoner\r\n\r\nA TRUMPETER, bravely leading on the soldiers, was captured by the enemy.\r\nHe cried out to his captors, \"Pray spare me, and do not take my life\r\nwithout cause or without inquiry. I have not slain a single man of your\r\ntroop. I have no arms, and carry nothing but this one brass trumpet.\"\r\n\"That is the very reason for which you should be put to death,\" they\r\nsaid; \"for, while you do not fight yourself, your trumpet stirs all the\r\nothers to battle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ass in the Lion's Skin\r\n\r\nAN ASS, having put on the Lion's skin, roamed about in the forest and\r\namused himself by frightening all the foolish animals he met in his\r\nwanderings. At last coming upon a Fox, he tried to frighten him also,\r\nbut the Fox no sooner heard the sound of his voice than he exclaimed,\r\n\"I might possibly have been frightened myself, if I had not heard your\r\nbray.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sparrow and the Hare\r\n\r\nA HARE pounced upon by an eagle sobbed very much and uttered cries like\r\na child. A Sparrow upbraided her and said, \"Where now is thy remarkable\r\nswiftness of foot? Why were your feet so slow?\" While the Sparrow was\r\nthus speaking, a hawk suddenly seized him and killed him. The Hare was\r\ncomforted in her death, and expiring said, \"Ah! you who so lately, when\r\nyou supposed yourself safe, exulted over my calamity, have now reason to\r\ndeplore a similar misfortune.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Flea and the Ox\r\n\r\nA FLEA thus questioned an Ox: \"What ails you, that being so huge and\r\nstrong, you submit to the wrongs you receive from men and slave for\r\nthem day by day, while I, being so small a creature, mercilessly feed on\r\ntheir flesh and drink their blood without stint?\" The Ox replied: \"I do\r\nnot wish to be ungrateful, for I am loved and well cared for by men, and\r\nthey often pat my head and shoulders.\" \"Woe's me!\" said the flea; \"this\r\nvery patting which you like, whenever it happens to me, brings with it\r\nmy inevitable destruction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Goods and the Ills\r\n\r\nALL the Goods were once driven out by the Ills from that common share\r\nwhich they each had in the affairs of mankind; for the Ills by reason\r\nof their numbers had prevailed to possess the earth. The Goods wafted\r\nthemselves to heaven and asked for a righteous vengeance on their\r\npersecutors. They entreated Jupiter that they might no longer be\r\nassociated with the Ills, as they had nothing in common and could\r\nnot live together, but were engaged in unceasing warfare; and that an\r\nindissoluble law might be laid down for their future protection. Jupiter\r\ngranted their request and decreed that henceforth the Ills should visit\r\nthe earth in company with each other, but that the Goods should one by\r\none enter the habitations of men. Hence it arises that Ills abound, for\r\nthey come not one by one, but in troops, and by no means singly: while\r\nthe Goods proceed from Jupiter, and are given, not alike to all, but\r\nsingly, and separately; and one by one to those who are able to discern\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dove and the Crow\r\n\r\nA DOVE shut up in a cage was boasting of the large number of young ones\r\nwhich she had hatched. A Crow hearing her, said: \"My good friend, cease\r\nfrom this unseasonable boasting. The larger the number of your family,\r\nthe greater your cause of sorrow, in seeing them shut up in this\r\nprison-house.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMercury and the Workmen\r\n\r\nA WORKMAN, felling wood by the side of a river, let his axe drop by\r\naccident into a deep pool. Being thus deprived of the means of his\r\nlivelihood, he sat down on the bank and lamented his hard fate. Mercury\r\nappeared and demanded the cause of his tears. After he told him his\r\nmisfortune, Mercury plunged into the stream, and, bringing up a golden\r\naxe, inquired if that were the one he had lost. On his saying that\r\nit was not his, Mercury disappeared beneath the water a second time,\r\nreturned with a silver axe in his hand, and again asked the Workman if\r\nit were his. When the Workman said it was not, he dived into the pool\r\nfor the third time and brought up the axe that had been lost. The\r\nWorkman claimed it and expressed his joy at its recovery. Mercury,\r\npleased with his honesty, gave him the golden and silver axes in\r\naddition to his own. The Workman, on his return to his house, related\r\nto his companions all that had happened. One of them at once resolved\r\nto try and secure the same good fortune for himself. He ran to the river\r\nand threw his axe on purpose into the pool at the same place, and sat\r\ndown on the bank to weep. Mercury appeared to him just as he hoped\r\nhe would; and having learned the cause of his grief, plunged into the\r\nstream and brought up a golden axe, inquiring if he had lost it. The\r\nWorkman seized it greedily, and declared that truly it was the very same\r\naxe that he had lost. Mercury, displeased at his knavery, not only\r\ntook away the golden axe, but refused to recover for him the axe he had\r\nthrown into the pool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eagle and the Jackdaw\r\n\r\nAN EAGLE, flying down from his perch on a lofty rock, seized upon a\r\nlamb and carried him aloft in his talons. A Jackdaw, who witnessed the\r\ncapture of the lamb, was stirred with envy and determined to emulate the\r\nstrength and flight of the Eagle. He flew around with a great whir of\r\nhis wings and settled upon a large ram, with the intention of carrying\r\nhim off, but his claws became entangled in the ram's fleece and he was\r\nnot able to release himself, although he fluttered with his feathers\r\nas much as he could. The shepherd, seeing what had happened, ran up and\r\ncaught him. He at once clipped the Jackdaw's wings, and taking him home\r\nat night, gave him to his children. On their saying, \"Father, what kind\r\nof bird is it?\" he replied, \"To my certain knowledge he is a Daw; but he\r\nwould like you to think an Eagle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fox and the Crane\r\n\r\nA FOX invited a Crane to supper and provided nothing for his\r\nentertainment but some soup made of pulse, which was poured out into a\r\nbroad flat stone dish. The soup fell out of the long bill of the Crane\r\nat every mouthful, and his vexation at not being able to eat afforded\r\nthe Fox much amusement. The Crane, in his turn, asked the Fox to sup\r\nwith him, and set before her a flagon with a long narrow mouth, so that\r\nhe could easily insert his neck and enjoy its contents at his leisure.\r\nThe Fox, unable even to taste it, met with a fitting requital, after the\r\nfashion of her own hospitality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJupiter, Neptune, Minerva, and Momus\r\n\r\nACCORDING to an ancient legend, the first man was made by Jupiter, the\r\nfirst bull by Neptune, and the first house by Minerva. On the completion\r\nof their labors, a dispute arose as to which had made the most perfect\r\nwork. They agreed to appoint Momus as judge, and to abide by his\r\ndecision. Momus, however, being very envious of the handicraft of each,\r\nfound fault with all. He first blamed the work of Neptune because he had\r\nnot made the horns of the bull below his eyes, so he might better see\r\nwhere to strike. He then condemned the work of Jupiter, because he had\r\nnot placed the heart of man on the outside, that everyone might read the\r\nthoughts of the evil disposed and take precautions against the intended\r\nmischief. And, lastly, he inveighed against Minerva because she had not\r\ncontrived iron wheels in the foundation of her house, so its inhabitants\r\nmight more easily remove if a neighbor proved unpleasant. Jupiter,\r\nindignant at such inveterate faultfinding, drove him from his office of\r\njudge, and expelled him from the mansions of Olympus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eagle and the Fox\r\n\r\nAN EAGLE and a Fox formed an intimate friendship and decided to live\r\nnear each other. The Eagle built her nest in the branches of a tall\r\ntree, while the Fox crept into the underwood and there produced her\r\nyoung. Not long after they had agreed upon this plan, the Eagle, being\r\nin want of provision for her young ones, swooped down while the Fox was\r\nout, seized upon one of the little cubs, and feasted herself and her\r\nbrood. The Fox on her return, discovered what had happened, but was\r\nless grieved for the death of her young than for her inability to avenge\r\nthem. A just retribution, however, quickly fell upon the Eagle. While\r\nhovering near an altar, on which some villagers were sacrificing a goat,\r\nshe suddenly seized a piece of the flesh, and carried it, along with a\r\nburning cinder, to her nest. A strong breeze soon fanned the spark into\r\na flame, and the eaglets, as yet unfledged and helpless, were roasted\r\nin their nest and dropped down dead at the bottom of the tree. There, in\r\nthe sight of the Eagle, the Fox gobbled them up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Man and the Satyr\r\n\r\nA MAN and a Satyr once drank together in token of a bond of alliance\r\nbeing formed between them. One very cold wintry day, as they talked, the\r\nMan put his fingers to his mouth and blew on them. When the Satyr\r\nasked the reason for this, he told him that he did it to warm his hands\r\nbecause they were so cold. Later on in the day they sat down to eat, and\r\nthe food prepared was quite scalding. The Man raised one of the dishes\r\na little towards his mouth and blew in it. When the Satyr again inquired\r\nthe reason, he said that he did it to cool the meat, which was too hot.\r\n\"I can no longer consider you as a friend,\" said the Satyr, \"a fellow\r\nwho with the same breath blows hot and cold.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ass and His Purchaser\r\n\r\nA MAN wished to purchase an Ass, and agreed with its owner that he\r\nshould try out the animal before he bought him. He took the Ass home\r\nand put him in the straw-yard with his other Asses, upon which the new\r\nanimal left all the others and at once joined the one that was most idle\r\nand the greatest eater of them all. Seeing this, the man put a halter\r\non him and led him back to his owner. On being asked how, in so short a\r\ntime, he could have made a trial of him, he answered, \"I do not need a\r\ntrial; I know that he will be just the same as the one he chose for his\r\ncompanion.\"\r\n\r\nA man is known by the company he keeps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Two Bags\r\n\r\nEVERY MAN, according to an ancient legend, is born into the world with\r\ntwo bags suspended from his neck all bag in front full of his neighbors'\r\nfaults, and a large bag behind filled with his own faults. Hence it is\r\nthat men are quick to see the faults of others, and yet are often blind\r\nto their own failings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Stag at the Pool\r\n\r\nA STAG overpowered by heat came to a spring to drink. Seeing his own\r\nshadow reflected in the water, he greatly admired the size and variety\r\nof his horns, but felt angry with himself for having such slender and\r\nweak feet. While he was thus contemplating himself, a Lion appeared at\r\nthe pool and crouched to spring upon him. The Stag immediately took to\r\nflight, and exerting his utmost speed, as long as the plain was smooth\r\nand open kept himself easily at a safe distance from the Lion. But\r\nentering a wood he became entangled by his horns, and the Lion quickly\r\ncame up to him and caught him. When too late, he thus reproached\r\nhimself: \"Woe is me! How I have deceived myself! These feet which would\r\nhave saved me I despised, and I gloried in these antlers which have\r\nproved my destruction.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is most truly valuable is often underrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Jackdaw and the Fox\r\n\r\nA HALF-FAMISHED JACKDAW seated himself on a fig-tree, which had produced\r\nsome fruit entirely out of season, and waited in the hope that the figs\r\nwould ripen. A Fox seeing him sitting so long and learning the reason\r\nof his doing so, said to him, \"You are indeed, sir, sadly deceiving\r\nyourself; you are indulging a hope strong enough to cheat you, but which\r\nwill never reward you with enjoyment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lark Burying Her Father\r\n\r\nTHE LARK (according to an ancient legend) was created before the earth\r\nitself, and when her father died, as there was no earth, she could find\r\nno place of burial for him. She let him lie uninterred for five days,\r\nand on the sixth day, not knowing what else to do, she buried him in her\r\nown head. Hence she obtained her crest, which is popularly said to be\r\nher father's grave-hillock.\r\n\r\nYouth's first duty is reverence to parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Gnat and the Bull\r\n\r\nA GNAT settled on the horn of a Bull, and sat there a long time. Just\r\nas he was about to fly off, he made a buzzing noise, and inquired of the\r\nBull if he would like him to go. The Bull replied, \"I did not know you\r\nhad come, and I shall not miss you when you go away.\"\r\n\r\nSome men are of more consequence in their own eyes than in the eyes of\r\ntheir neighbors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bitch and Her Whelps\r\n\r\nA BITCH, ready to whelp, earnestly begged a shepherd for a place where\r\nshe might litter. When her request was granted, she besought permission\r\nto rear her puppies in the same spot. The shepherd again consented. But\r\nat last the Bitch, protected by the bodyguard of her Whelps, who had\r\nnow grown up and were able to defend themselves, asserted her exclusive\r\nright to the place and would not permit the shepherd to approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dogs and the Hides\r\n\r\nSOME DOGS famished with hunger saw a number of cowhides steeping in a\r\nriver. Not being able to reach them, they agreed to drink up the river,\r\nbut it happened that they burst themselves with drinking long before\r\nthey reached the hides.\r\n\r\nAttempt not impossibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Shepherd and the Sheep\r\n\r\nA SHEPHERD driving his Sheep to a wood, saw an oak of unusual size full\r\nof acorns, and spreading his cloak under the branches, he climbed\r\nup into the tree and shook them down. The Sheep eating the acorns\r\ninadvertently frayed and tore the cloak. When the Shepherd came down\r\nand saw what was done, he said, \"O you most ungrateful creatures! You\r\nprovide wool to make garments for all other men, but you destroy the\r\nclothes of him who feeds you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Grasshopper and the Owl\r\n\r\nAN OWL, accustomed to feed at night and to sleep during the day, was\r\ngreatly disturbed by the noise of a Grasshopper and earnestly besought\r\nher to stop chirping. The Grasshopper refused to desist, and chirped\r\nlouder and louder the more the Owl entreated. When she saw that she\r\ncould get no redress and that her words were despised, the Owl attacked\r\nthe chatterer by a stratagem. \"Since I cannot sleep,\" she said, \"on\r\naccount of your song which, believe me, is sweet as the lyre of Apollo,\r\nI shall indulge myself in drinking some nectar which Pallas lately gave\r\nme. If you do not dislike it, come to me and we will drink it together.\"\r\nThe Grasshopper, who was thirsty, and pleased with the praise of her\r\nvoice, eagerly flew up. The Owl came forth from her hollow, seized her,\r\nand put her to death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Monkey and the Camel\r\n\r\nTHE BEASTS of the forest gave a splendid entertainment at which the\r\nMonkey stood up and danced. Having vastly delighted the assembly, he\r\nsat down amidst universal applause. The Camel, envious of the praises\r\nbestowed on the Monkey and desiring to divert to himself the favor\r\nof the guests, proposed to stand up in his turn and dance for their\r\namusement. He moved about in so utterly ridiculous a manner that the\r\nBeasts, in a fit of indignation, set upon him with clubs and drove him\r\nout of the assembly.\r\n\r\nIt is absurd to ape our betters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Peasant and the Apple-Tree\r\n\r\nA PEASANT had in his garden an Apple-Tree which bore no fruit but only\r\nserved as a harbor for the sparrows and grasshoppers. He resolved to\r\ncut it down, and taking his axe in his hand, made a bold stroke at its\r\nroots. The grasshoppers and sparrows entreated him not to cut down the\r\ntree that sheltered them, but to spare it, and they would sing to him\r\nand lighten his labors. He paid no attention to their request, but gave\r\nthe tree a second and a third blow with his axe. When he reached the\r\nhollow of the tree, he found a hive full of honey. Having tasted the\r\nhoneycomb, he threw down his axe, and looking on the tree as sacred,\r\ntook great care of it.\r\n\r\nSelf-interest alone moves some men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Two Soldiers and the Robber\r\n\r\nTWO SOLDIERS traveling together were set upon by a Robber. The one fled\r\naway; the other stood his ground and defended himself with his stout\r\nright hand. The Robber being slain, the timid companion ran up and drew\r\nhis sword, and then, throwing back his traveling cloak said, \"I'll at\r\nhim, and I'll take care he shall learn whom he has attacked.\" On this,\r\nhe who had fought with the Robber made answer, \"I only wish that you\r\nhad helped me just now, even if it had been only with those words, for I\r\nshould have been the more encouraged, believing them to be true; but now\r\nput up your sword in its sheath and hold your equally useless tongue,\r\ntill you can deceive others who do not know you. I, indeed, who have\r\nexperienced with what speed you run away, know right well that no\r\ndependence can be placed on your valor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Trees Under the Protection of the Gods\r\n\r\nTHE GODS, according to an ancient legend, made choice of certain trees\r\nto be under their special protection. Jupiter chose the oak, Venus the\r\nmyrtle, Apollo the laurel, Cybele the pine, and Hercules the poplar.\r\nMinerva, wondering why they had preferred trees not yielding fruit,\r\ninquired the reason for their choice. Jupiter replied, \"It is lest we\r\nshould seem to covet the honor for the fruit.\" But said Minerva, \"Let\r\nanyone say what he will the olive is more dear to me on account of its\r\nfruit.\" Then said Jupiter, \"My daughter, you are rightly called wise;\r\nfor unless what we do is useful, the glory of it is vain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mother and the Wolf\r\n\r\nA FAMISHED WOLF was prowling about in the morning in search of food. As\r\nhe passed the door of a cottage built in the forest, he heard a Mother\r\nsay to her child, \"Be quiet, or I will throw you out of the window, and\r\nthe Wolf shall eat you.\" The Wolf sat all day waiting at the door. In\r\nthe evening he heard the same woman fondling her child and saying: \"You\r\nare quiet now, and if the Wolf should come, we will kill him.\" The Wolf,\r\nhearing these words, went home, gasping with cold and hunger. When he\r\nreached his den, Mistress Wolf inquired of him why he returned wearied\r\nand supperless, so contrary to his wont. He replied: \"Why, forsooth! use\r\nI gave credence to the words of a woman!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ass and the Horse\r\n\r\nAN ASS besought a Horse to spare him a small portion of his feed. \"Yes,\"\r\nsaid the Horse; \"if any remains out of what I am now eating I will give\r\nit you for the sake of my own superior dignity, and if you will come\r\nwhen I reach my own stall in the evening, I will give you a little sack\r\nfull of barley.\" The Ass replied, \"Thank you. But I can't think that\r\nyou, who refuse me a little matter now, will by and by confer on me a\r\ngreater benefit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTruth and the Traveler\r\n\r\nA WAYFARING MAN, traveling in the desert, met a woman standing alone\r\nand terribly dejected. He inquired of her, \"Who art thou?\" \"My name is\r\nTruth,\" she replied. \"And for what cause,\" he asked, \"have you left the\r\ncity to dwell alone here in the wilderness?\" She made answer, \"Because\r\nin former times, falsehood was with few, but is now with all men.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Manslayer\r\n\r\nA MAN committed a murder, and was pursued by the relations of the man\r\nwhom he murdered. On his reaching the river Nile he saw a Lion on its\r\nbank and being fearfully afraid, climbed up a tree. He found a serpent\r\nin the upper branches of the tree, and again being greatly alarmed, he\r\nthrew himself into the river, where a crocodile caught him and ate\r\nhim. Thus the earth, the air, and the water alike refused shelter to a\r\nmurderer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion and the Fox\r\n\r\nA FOX entered into partnership with a Lion on the pretense of becoming\r\nhis servant. Each undertook his proper duty in accordance with his own\r\nnature and powers. The Fox discovered and pointed out the prey; the\r\nLion sprang on it and seized it. The Fox soon became jealous of the Lion\r\ncarrying off the Lion's share, and said that he would no longer find\r\nout the prey, but would capture it on his own account. The next day he\r\nattempted to snatch a lamb from the fold, but he himself fell prey to\r\nthe huntsmen and hounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion and the Eagle\r\n\r\nAN EAGLE stayed his flight and entreated a Lion to make an alliance with\r\nhim to their mutual advantage. The Lion replied, \"I have no objection,\r\nbut you must excuse me for requiring you to find surety for your good\r\nfaith, for how can I trust anyone as a friend who is able to fly away\r\nfrom his bargain whenever he pleases?\"\r\n\r\nTry before you trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hen and the Swallow\r\n\r\nA HEN finding the eggs of a viper and carefully keeping them warm,\r\nnourished them into life. A Swallow, observing what she had done, said,\r\n\"You silly creature! why have you hatched these vipers which, when they\r\nshall have grown, will inflict injury on all, beginning with yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Buffoon and the Countryman\r\n\r\nA RICH NOBLEMAN once opened the theaters without charge to the people,\r\nand gave a public notice that he would handsomely reward any person who\r\ninvented a new amusement for the occasion. Various public performers\r\ncontended for the prize. Among them came a Buffoon well known among the\r\npopulace for his jokes, and said that he had a kind of entertainment\r\nwhich had never been brought out on any stage before. This report being\r\nspread about made a great stir, and the theater was crowded in every\r\npart. The Buffoon appeared alone upon the platform, without any\r\napparatus or confederates, and the very sense of expectation caused\r\nan intense silence. He suddenly bent his head towards his bosom and\r\nimitated the squeaking of a little pig so admirably with his voice that\r\nthe audience declared he had a porker under his cloak, and demanded that\r\nit should be shaken out. When that was done and nothing was found,\r\nthey cheered the actor, and loaded him with the loudest applause. A\r\nCountryman in the crowd, observing all that has passed, said, \"So\r\nhelp me, Hercules, he shall not beat me at that trick!\" and at once\r\nproclaimed that he would do the same thing on the next day, though in a\r\nmuch more natural way. On the morrow a still larger crowd assembled in\r\nthe theater, but now partiality for their favorite actor very generally\r\nprevailed, and the audience came rather to ridicule the Countryman than\r\nto see the spectacle. Both of the performers appeared on the stage.\r\nThe Buffoon grunted and squeaked away first, and obtained, as on the\r\npreceding day, the applause and cheers of the spectators. Next the\r\nCountryman commenced, and pretending that he concealed a little pig\r\nbeneath his clothes (which in truth he did, but not suspected by the\r\naudience ) contrived to take hold of and to pull his ear causing the\r\npig to squeak. The Crowd, however, cried out with one consent that\r\nthe Buffoon had given a far more exact imitation, and clamored for the\r\nCountryman to be kicked out of the theater. On this the rustic produced\r\nthe little pig from his cloak and showed by the most positive proof the\r\ngreatness of their mistake. \"Look here,\" he said, \"this shows what sort\r\nof judges you are.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crow and the Serpent\r\n\r\nA CROW in great want of food saw a Serpent asleep in a sunny nook, and\r\nflying down, greedily seized him. The Serpent, turning about, bit the\r\nCrow with a mortal wound. In the agony of death, the bird exclaimed: \"O\r\nunhappy me! who have found in that which I deemed a happy windfall the\r\nsource of my destruction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hunter and the Horseman\r\n\r\nA CERTAIN HUNTER, having snared a hare, placed it upon his shoulders and\r\nset out homewards. On his way he met a man on horseback who begged the\r\nhare of him, under the pretense of purchasing it. However, when the\r\nHorseman got the hare, he rode off as fast as he could. The Hunter\r\nran after him, as if he was sure of overtaking him, but the Horseman\r\nincreased more and more the distance between them. The Hunter, sorely\r\nagainst his will, called out to him and said, \"Get along with you! for I\r\nwill now make you a present of the hare.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe King's Son and the Painted Lion\r\n\r\nA KING, whose only son was fond of martial exercises, had a dream in\r\nwhich he was warned that his son would be killed by a lion. Afraid the\r\ndream should prove true, he built for his son a pleasant palace and\r\nadorned its walls for his amusement with all kinds of life-sized\r\nanimals, among which was the picture of a lion. When the young Prince\r\nsaw this, his grief at being thus confined burst out afresh, and,\r\nstanding near the lion, he said: \"O you most detestable of animals!\r\nthrough a lying dream of my father's, which he saw in his sleep, I am\r\nshut up on your account in this palace as if I had been a girl: what\r\nshall I now do to you?\" With these words he stretched out his hands\r\ntoward a thorn-tree, meaning to cut a stick from its branches so that he\r\nmight beat the lion. But one of the tree's prickles pierced his finger\r\nand caused great pain and inflammation, so that the young Prince fell\r\ndown in a fainting fit. A violent fever suddenly set in, from which he\r\ndied not many days later.\r\n\r\nWe had better bear our troubles bravely than try to escape them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cat and Venus\r\n\r\nA CAT fell in love with a handsome young man, and entreated Venus to\r\nchange her into the form of a woman. Venus consented to her request and\r\ntransformed her into a beautiful damsel, so that the youth saw her and\r\nloved her, and took her home as his bride. While the two were reclining\r\nin their chamber, Venus wishing to discover if the Cat in her change\r\nof shape had also altered her habits of life, let down a mouse in the\r\nmiddle of the room. The Cat, quite forgetting her present condition,\r\nstarted up from the couch and pursued the mouse, wishing to eat it.\r\nVenus was much disappointed and again caused her to return to her former\r\nshape.\r\n\r\nNature exceeds nurture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe She-Goats and Their Beards\r\n\r\nTHE SHE-GOATS having obtained a beard by request to Jupiter, the\r\nHe-Goats were sorely displeased and made complaint that the females\r\nequaled them in dignity. \"Allow them,\" said Jupiter, \"to enjoy an empty\r\nhonor and to assume the badge of your nobler sex, so long as they are\r\nnot your equals in strength or courage.\"\r\n\r\nIt matters little if those who are inferior to us in merit should be\r\nlike us in outside appearances.\r\n\r\nThe Camel and the Arab\r\n\r\nAN ARAB CAMEL-DRIVER, after completing the loading of his Camel, asked\r\nhim which he would like best, to go up hill or down. The poor beast\r\nreplied, not without a touch of reason: \"Why do you ask me? Is it that\r\nthe level way through the desert is closed?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Miller, His Son, and Their Ass\r\n\r\nA MILLER and his son were driving their Ass to a neighboring fair to\r\nsell him. They had not gone far when they met with a troop of women\r\ncollected round a well, talking and laughing. \"Look there,\" cried one of\r\nthem, \"did you ever see such fellows, to be trudging along the road on\r\nfoot when they might ride?\" The old man hearing this, quickly made his\r\nson mount the Ass, and continued to walk along merrily by his side.\r\nPresently they came up to a group of old men in earnest debate. \"There,\"\r\nsaid one of them, \"it proves what I was a-saying. What respect is shown\r\nto old age in these days? Do you see that idle lad riding while his old\r\nfather has to walk? Get down, you young scapegrace, and let the old man\r\nrest his weary limbs.\" Upon this the old man made his son dismount, and\r\ngot up himself. In this manner they had not proceeded far when they\r\nmet a company of women and children: \"Why, you lazy old fellow,\" cried\r\nseveral tongues at once, \"how can you ride upon the beast, while that\r\npoor little lad there can hardly keep pace by the side of you?\" The\r\ngood-natured Miller immediately took up his son behind him. They had now\r\nalmost reached the town. \"Pray, honest friend,\" said a citizen, \"is\r\nthat Ass your own?\" \"Yes,\" replied the old man. \"O, one would not have\r\nthought so,\" said the other, \"by the way you load him. Why, you two\r\nfellows are better able to carry the poor beast than he you.\" \"Anything\r\nto please you,\" said the old man; \"we can but try.\" So, alighting with\r\nhis son, they tied the legs of the Ass together and with the help of a\r\npole endeavored to carry him on their shoulders over a bridge near the\r\nentrance to the town. This entertaining sight brought the people in\r\ncrowds to laugh at it, till the Ass, not liking the noise nor the\r\nstrange handling that he was subject to, broke the cords that bound him\r\nand, tumbling off the pole, fell into the river. Upon this, the old man,\r\nvexed and ashamed, made the best of his way home again, convinced that\r\nby endeavoring to please everybody he had pleased nobody, and lost his\r\nAss in the bargain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crow and the Sheep\r\n\r\nA TROUBLESOME CROW seated herself on the back of a Sheep. The Sheep,\r\nmuch against his will, carried her backward and forward for a long time,\r\nand at last said, \"If you had treated a dog in this way, you would have\r\nhad your deserts from his sharp teeth.\" To this the Crow replied, \"I\r\ndespise the weak and yield to the strong. I know whom I may bully and\r\nwhom I must flatter; and I thus prolong my life to a good old age.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fox and the Bramble\r\n\r\nA FOX was mounting a hedge when he lost his footing and caught hold of a\r\nBramble to save himself. Having pricked and grievously tom the soles of\r\nhis feet, he accused the Bramble because, when he had fled to her for\r\nassistance, she had used him worse than the hedge itself. The Bramble,\r\ninterrupting him, said, \"But you really must have been out of your\r\nsenses to fasten yourself on me, who am myself always accustomed to\r\nfasten upon others.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wolf and the Lion\r\n\r\nA WOLF, having stolen a lamb from a fold, was carrying him off to his\r\nlair. A Lion met him in the path, and seizing the lamb, took it\r\nfrom him. Standing at a safe distance, the Wolf exclaimed, \"You have\r\nunrighteously taken that which was mine from me!\" To which the Lion\r\njeeringly replied, \"It was righteously yours, eh? The gift of a friend?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dog and the Oyster\r\n\r\nA DOG, used to eating eggs, saw an Oyster and, opening his mouth to its\r\nwidest extent, swallowed it down with the utmost relish, supposing it to\r\nbe an egg. Soon afterwards suffering great pain in his stomach, he said,\r\n\"I deserve all this torment, for my folly in thinking that everything\r\nround must be an egg.\"\r\n\r\nThey who act without sufficient thought, will often fall into\r\nunsuspected danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ant and the Dove\r\n\r\nAN ANT went to the bank of a river to quench its thirst, and being\r\ncarried away by the rush of the stream, was on the point of drowning. A\r\nDove sitting on a tree overhanging the water plucked a leaf and let it\r\nfall into the stream close to her. The Ant climbed onto it and floated\r\nin safety to the bank. Shortly afterwards a birdcatcher came and stood\r\nunder the tree, and laid his lime-twigs for the Dove, which sat in the\r\nbranches. The Ant, perceiving his design, stung him in the foot. In pain\r\nthe birdcatcher threw down the twigs, and the noise made the Dove take\r\nwing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Partridge and the Fowler\r\n\r\nA FOWLER caught a Partridge and was about to kill it. The Partridge\r\nearnestly begged him to spare his life, saying, \"Pray, master, permit me\r\nto live and I will entice many Partridges to you in recompense for your\r\nmercy to me.\" The Fowler replied, \"I shall now with less scruple take\r\nyour life, because you are willing to save it at the cost of betraying\r\nyour friends and relations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Flea and the Man\r\n\r\nA MAN, very much annoyed with a Flea, caught him at last, and said, \"Who\r\nare you who dare to feed on my limbs, and to cost me so much trouble in\r\ncatching you?\" The Flea replied, \"O my dear sir, pray spare my life,\r\nand destroy me not, for I cannot possibly do you much harm.\" The Man,\r\nlaughing, replied, \"Now you shall certainly die by mine own hands, for\r\nno evil, whether it be small or large, ought to be tolerated.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Thieves and the Cock\r\n\r\nSOME THIEVES broke into a house and found nothing but a Cock, whom they\r\nstole, and got off as fast as they could. Upon arriving at home they\r\nprepared to kill the Cock, who thus pleaded for his life: \"Pray spare\r\nme; I am very serviceable to men. I wake them up in the night to their\r\nwork.\" \"That is the very reason why we must the more kill you,\" they\r\nreplied; \"for when you wake your neighbors, you entirely put an end to\r\nour business.\"\r\n\r\nThe safeguards of virtue are hateful to those with evil intentions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dog and the Cook\r\n\r\nA RICH MAN gave a great feast, to which he invited many friends and\r\nacquaintances. His Dog availed himself of the occasion to invite a\r\nstranger Dog, a friend of his, saying, \"My master gives a feast, and\r\nthere is always much food remaining; come and sup with me tonight.\" The\r\nDog thus invited went at the hour appointed, and seeing the preparations\r\nfor so grand an entertainment, said in the joy of his heart, \"How glad\r\nI am that I came! I do not often get such a chance as this. I will take\r\ncare and eat enough to last me both today and tomorrow.\" While he was\r\ncongratulating himself and wagging his tail to convey his pleasure to\r\nhis friend, the Cook saw him moving about among his dishes and, seizing\r\nhim by his fore and hind paws, bundled him without ceremony out of the\r\nwindow. He fell with force upon the ground and limped away, howling\r\ndreadfully. His yelling soon attracted other street dogs, who came up\r\nto him and inquired how he had enjoyed his supper. He replied, \"Why, to\r\ntell you the truth, I drank so much wine that I remember nothing. I do\r\nnot know how I got out of the house.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Travelers and the Plane-Tree\r\n\r\nTWO TRAVELERS, worn out by the heat of the summer's sun, laid themselves\r\ndown at noon under the widespreading branches of a Plane-Tree. As they\r\nrested under its shade, one of the Travelers said to the other, \"What a\r\nsingularly useless tree is the Plane! It bears no fruit, and is not of\r\nthe least service to man.\" The Plane-Tree, interrupting him, said, \"You\r\nungrateful fellows! Do you, while receiving benefits from me and resting\r\nunder my shade, dare to describe me as useless, and unprofitable?\"\r\n\r\nSome men underrate their best blessings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hares and the Frogs\r\n\r\nTHE HARES, oppressed by their own exceeding timidity and weary of the\r\nperpetual alarm to which they were exposed, with one accord determined\r\nto put an end to themselves and their troubles by jumping from a lofty\r\nprecipice into a deep lake below. As they scampered off in large numbers\r\nto carry out their resolve, the Frogs lying on the banks of the lake\r\nheard the noise of their feet and rushed helter-skelter to the deep\r\nwater for safety. On seeing the rapid disappearance of the Frogs, one of\r\nthe Hares cried out to his companions: \"Stay, my friends, do not do as\r\nyou intended; for you now see that there are creatures who are still\r\nmore timid than ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion, Jupiter, and the Elephant\r\n\r\nTHE LION wearied Jupiter with his frequent complaints. \"It is true, O\r\nJupiter!\" he said, \"that I am gigantic in strength, handsome in shape,\r\nand powerful in attack. I have jaws well provided with teeth, and feet\r\nfurnished with claws, and I lord it over all the beasts of the forest,\r\nand what a disgrace it is, that being such as I am, I should be\r\nfrightened by the crowing of a cock.\" Jupiter replied, \"Why do you blame\r\nme without a cause? I have given you all the attributes which I possess\r\nmyself, and your courage never fails you except in this one instance.\"\r\nOn hearing this the Lion groaned and lamented very much and, reproaching\r\nhimself with his cowardice, wished that he might die. As these thoughts\r\npassed through his mind, he met an Elephant and came close to hold a\r\nconversation with him. After a time he observed that the Elephant shook\r\nhis ears very often, and he inquired what was the matter and why his\r\nears moved with such a tremor every now and then. Just at that moment\r\na Gnat settled on the head of the Elephant, and he replied, \"Do you see\r\nthat little buzzing insect? If it enters my ear, my fate is sealed. I\r\nshould die presently.\" The Lion said, \"Well, since so huge a beast is\r\nafraid of a tiny gnat, I will no more complain, nor wish myself dead. I\r\nfind myself, even as I am, better off than the Elephant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lamb and the Wolf\r\n\r\nA WOLF pursued a Lamb, which fled for refuge to a certain Temple. The\r\nWolf called out to him and said, \"The Priest will slay you in sacrifice,\r\nif he should catch you.\" On which the Lamb replied, \"It would be better\r\nfor me to be sacrificed in the Temple than to be eaten by you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rich Man and the Tanner\r\n\r\nA RICH MAN lived near a Tanner, and not being able to bear the\r\nunpleasant smell of the tan-yard, he pressed his neighbor to go away.\r\nThe Tanner put off his departure from time to time, saying that he would\r\nleave soon. But as he still continued to stay, as time went on, the\r\nrich man became accustomed to the smell, and feeling no manner of\r\ninconvenience, made no further complaints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Shipwrecked Man and the Sea\r\n\r\nA SHIPWRECKED MAN, having been cast upon a certain shore, slept after\r\nhis buffetings with the deep. After a while he awoke, and looking upon\r\nthe Sea, loaded it with reproaches. He argued that it enticed men with\r\nthe calmness of its looks, but when it had induced them to plow its\r\nwaters, it grew rough and destroyed them. The Sea, assuming the form of\r\na woman, replied to him: \"Blame not me, my good sir, but the winds, for\r\nI am by my own nature as calm and firm even as this earth; but the winds\r\nsuddenly falling on me create these waves, and lash me into fury.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mules and the Robbers\r\n\r\nTWO MULES well-laden with packs were trudging along. One carried\r\npanniers filled with money, the other sacks weighted with grain. The\r\nMule carrying the treasure walked with head erect, as if conscious of\r\nthe value of his burden, and tossed up and down the clear-toned bells\r\nfastened to his neck. His companion followed with quiet and easy step.\r\nAll of a sudden Robbers rushed upon them from their hiding-places, and\r\nin the scuffle with their owners, wounded with a sword the Mule carrying\r\nthe treasure, which they greedily seized while taking no notice of\r\nthe grain. The Mule which had been robbed and wounded bewailed his\r\nmisfortunes. The other replied, \"I am indeed glad that I was thought so\r\nlittle of, for I have lost nothing, nor am I hurt with any wound.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Viper and the File\r\n\r\nA LION, entering the workshop of a smith, sought from the tools the\r\nmeans of satisfying his hunger. He more particularly addressed himself\r\nto a File, and asked of him the favor of a meal. The File replied, \"You\r\nmust indeed be a simple-minded fellow if you expect to get anything from\r\nme, who am accustomed to take from everyone, and never to give anything\r\nin return.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion and the Shepherd\r\n\r\nA LION, roaming through a forest, trod upon a thorn. Soon afterward he\r\ncame up to a Shepherd and fawned upon him, wagging his tail as if to\r\nsay, \"I am a suppliant, and seek your aid.\" The Shepherd boldly examined\r\nthe beast, discovered the thorn, and placing his paw upon his lap,\r\npulled it out; thus relieved of his pain, the Lion returned into the\r\nforest. Some time after, the Shepherd, being imprisoned on a false\r\naccusation, was condemned \"to be cast to the Lions\" as the punishment\r\nfor his imputed crime. But when the Lion was released from his cage,\r\nhe recognized the Shepherd as the man who healed him, and instead of\r\nattacking him, approached and placed his foot upon his lap. The King, as\r\nsoon as he heard the tale, ordered the Lion to be set free again in the\r\nforest, and the Shepherd to be pardoned and restored to his friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Camel and Jupiter\r\n\r\nTHE CAMEL, when he saw the Bull adorned with horns, envied him and\r\nwished that he himself could obtain the same honors. He went to Jupiter,\r\nand besought him to give him horns. Jupiter, vexed at his request\r\nbecause he was not satisfied with his size and strength of body, and\r\ndesired yet more, not only refused to give him horns, but even deprived\r\nhim of a portion of his ears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Panther and the Shepherds\r\n\r\nA PANTHER, by some mischance, fell into a pit. The Shepherds discovered\r\nhim, and some threw sticks at him and pelted him with stones, while\r\nothers, moved with compassion towards one about to die even though no\r\none should hurt him, threw in some food to prolong his life. At night\r\nthey returned home, not dreaming of any danger, but supposing that on\r\nthe morrow they would find him dead. The Panther, however, when he had\r\nrecruited his feeble strength, freed himself with a sudden bound from\r\nthe pit, and hastened to his den with rapid steps. After a few days he\r\ncame forth and slaughtered the cattle, and, killing the Shepherds who\r\nhad attacked him, raged with angry fury. Then they who had spared his\r\nlife, fearing for their safety, surrendered to him their flocks and\r\nbegged only for their lives. To them the Panther made this reply: \"I\r\nremember alike those who sought my life with stones, and those who gave\r\nme food aside, therefore, your fears. I return as an enemy only to those\r\nwho injured me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ass and the Charger\r\n\r\nAN ASS congratulated a Horse on being so ungrudgingly and carefully\r\nprovided for, while he himself had scarcely enough to eat and not even\r\nthat without hard work. But when war broke out, a heavily armed soldier\r\nmounted the Horse, and riding him to the charge, rushed into the\r\nvery midst of the enemy. The Horse was wounded and fell dead on the\r\nbattlefield. Then the Ass, seeing all these things, changed his mind,\r\nand commiserated the Horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eagle and His Captor\r\n\r\nAN EAGLE was once captured by a man, who immediately clipped his\r\nwings and put him into his poultry-yard with the other birds, at which\r\ntreatment the Eagle was weighed down with grief. Later, another neighbor\r\npurchased him and allowed his feathers to grow again. The Eagle took\r\nflight, and pouncing upon a hare, brought it at once as an offering to\r\nhis benefactor. A Fox, seeing this, exclaimed, \"Do not cultivate the\r\nfavor of this man, but of your former owner, lest he should again hunt\r\nfor you and deprive you a second time of your wings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bald Man and the Fly\r\n\r\nA FLY bit the bare head of a Bald Man who, endeavoring to destroy it,\r\ngave himself a heavy slap. Escaping, the Fly said mockingly, \"You who\r\nhave wished to revenge, even with death, the Prick of a tiny insect, see\r\nwhat you have done to yourself to add insult to injury?\" The Bald Man\r\nreplied, \"I can easily make peace with myself, because I know there was\r\nno intention to hurt. But you, an ill-favored and contemptible insect\r\nwho delights in sucking human blood, I wish that I could have killed you\r\neven if I had incurred a heavier penalty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Olive-Tree and the Fig-Tree\r\n\r\nTHE OLIVE-TREE ridiculed the Fig-Tree because, while she was green all\r\nthe year round, the Fig-Tree changed its leaves with the seasons. A\r\nshower of snow fell upon them, and, finding the Olive full of foliage,\r\nit settled upon its branches and broke them down with its weight, at\r\nonce despoiling it of its beauty and killing the tree. But finding the\r\nFig-Tree denuded of leaves, the snow fell through to the ground, and did\r\nnot injure it at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eagle and the Kite\r\n\r\nAN EAGLE, overwhelmed with sorrow, sat upon the branches of a tree in\r\ncompany with a Kite. \"Why,\" said the Kite, \"do I see you with such a\r\nrueful look?\" \"I seek,\" she replied, \"a mate suitable for me, and am\r\nnot able to find one.\" \"Take me,\" returned the Kite, \"I am much stronger\r\nthan you are.\" \"Why, are you able to secure the means of living by your\r\nplunder?\" \"Well, I have often caught and carried away an ostrich in my\r\ntalons.\" The Eagle, persuaded by these words, accepted him as her mate.\r\nShortly after the nuptials, the Eagle said, \"Fly off and bring me back\r\nthe ostrich you promised me.\" The Kite, soaring aloft into the air,\r\nbrought back the shabbiest possible mouse, stinking from the length\r\nof time it had lain about the fields. \"Is this,\" said the Eagle, \"the\r\nfaithful fulfillment of your promise to me?\" The Kite replied, \"That\r\nI might attain your royal hand, there is nothing that I would not have\r\npromised, however much I knew that I must fail in the performance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ass and His Driver\r\n\r\nAN ASS, being driven along a high road, suddenly started off and bolted\r\nto the brink of a deep precipice. While he was in the act of throwing\r\nhimself over, his owner seized him by the tail, endeavoring to pull him\r\nback. When the Ass persisted in his effort, the man let him go and said,\r\n\"Conquer, but conquer to your cost.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Thrush and the Fowler\r\n\r\nA THRUSH was feeding on a myrtle-tree and did not move from it because\r\nits berries were so delicious. A Fowler observed her staying so long in\r\none spot, and having well bird-limed his reeds, caught her. The Thrush,\r\nbeing at the point of death, exclaimed, \"O foolish creature that I am!\r\nFor the sake of a little pleasant food I have deprived myself of my\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rose and the Amaranth\r\n\r\nAN AMARANTH planted in a garden near a Rose-Tree, thus addressed it:\r\n\"What a lovely flower is the Rose, a favorite alike with Gods and with\r\nmen. I envy you your beauty and your perfume.\" The Rose replied, \"I\r\nindeed, dear Amaranth, flourish but for a brief season! If no cruel hand\r\npluck me from my stem, yet I must perish by an early doom. But thou art\r\nimmortal and dost never fade, but bloomest for ever in renewed youth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Frogs' Complaint Against the Sun\r\n\r\nONCE UPON A TIME, when the Sun announced his intention to take a\r\nwife, the Frogs lifted up their voices in clamor to the sky. Jupiter,\r\ndisturbed by the noise of their croaking, inquired the cause of their\r\ncomplaint. One of them said, \"The Sun, now while he is single, parches\r\nup the marsh, and compels us to die miserably in our arid homes. What\r\nwill be our future condition if he should beget other suns?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF AESOP\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE and History of Aesop is involved, like that of Homer, the most\r\nfamous of Greek poets, in much obscurity. Sardis, the capital of Lydia;\r\nSamos, a Greek island; Mesembria, an ancient colony in Thrace; and\r\nCotiaeum, the chief city of a province of Phrygia, contend for the\r\ndistinction of being the birthplace of Aesop. Although the honor thus\r\nclaimed cannot be definitely assigned to any one of these places,\r\nyet there are a few incidents now generally accepted by scholars as\r\nestablished facts, relating to the birth, life, and death of Aesop. He\r\nis, by an almost universal consent, allowed to have been born about the\r\nyear 620 B.C., and to have been by birth a slave. He was owned by two\r\nmasters in succession, both inhabitants of Samos, Xanthus and Jadmon,\r\nthe latter of whom gave him his liberty as a reward for his learning\r\nand wit. One of the privileges of a freedman in the ancient republics of\r\nGreece, was the permission to take an active interest in public affairs;\r\nand Aesop, like the philosophers Phaedo, Menippus, and Epictetus, in\r\nlater times, raised himself from the indignity of a servile condition\r\nto a position of high renown. In his desire alike to instruct and to be\r\ninstructed, he travelled through many countries, and among others came\r\nto Sardis, the capital of the famous king of Lydia, the great patron, in\r\nthat day, of learning and of learned men. He met at the court of Croesus\r\nwith Solon, Thales, and other sages, and is related so to have pleased\r\nhis royal master, by the part he took in the conversations held with\r\nthese philosophers, that he applied to him an expression which has since\r\npassed into a proverb, \"The Phrygian has spoken better than all.\"\r\n\r\nOn the invitation of Croesus he fixed his residence at Sardis, and was\r\nemployed by that monarch in various difficult and delicate affairs of\r\nState. In his discharge of these commissions he visited the different\r\npetty republics of Greece. At one time he is found in Corinth, and at\r\nanother in Athens, endeavouring, by the narration of some of his\r\nwise fables, to reconcile the inhabitants of those cities to the\r\nadministration of their respective rulers Periander and Pisistratus. One\r\nof these ambassadorial missions, undertaken at the command of Croesus,\r\nwas the occasion of his death. Having been sent to Delphi with a large\r\nsum of gold for distribution among the citizens, he was so provoked at\r\ntheir covetousness that he refused to divide the money, and sent it back\r\nto his master. The Delphians, enraged at this treatment, accused him of\r\nimpiety, and, in spite of his sacred character as ambassador, executed\r\nhim as a public criminal. This cruel death of Aesop was not unavenged.\r\nThe citizens of Delphi were visited with a series of calamities, until\r\nthey made a public reparation of their crime; and, \"The blood of Aesop\"\r\nbecame a well-known adage, bearing witness to the truth that deeds of\r\nwrong would not pass unpunished. Neither did the great fabulist lack\r\nposthumous honors; for a statue was erected to his memory at Athens, the\r\nwork of Lysippus, one of the most famous of Greek sculptors. Phaedrus\r\nthus immortalizes the event:\r\n\r\n     Aesopo ingentem statuam posuere Attici,\r\n     Servumque collocarunt aeterna in basi:\r\n     Patere honoris scirent ut cuncti viam;\r\n     Nec generi tribui sed virtuti gloriam.\r\n\r\nThese few facts are all that can be relied on with any degree of\r\ncertainty, in reference to the birth, life, and death of Aesop. They\r\nwere first brought to light, after a patient search and diligent\r\nperusal of ancient authors, by a Frenchman, M. Claude Gaspard Bachet de\r\nMezeriac, who declined the honor of being tutor to Louis XIII of\r\nFrance, from his desire to devote himself exclusively to literature. He\r\npublished his Life of Aesop, Anno Domini 1632. The later investigations\r\nof a host of English and German scholars have added very little to the\r\nfacts given by M. Mezeriac. The substantial truth of his statements has\r\nbeen confirmed by later criticism and inquiry. It remains to state, that\r\nprior to this publication of M. Mezeriac, the life of Aesop was from the\r\npen of Maximus Planudes, a monk of Constantinople, who was sent on an\r\nembassy to Venice by the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus the elder, and who\r\nwrote in the early part of the fourteenth century. His life was prefixed\r\nto all the early editions of these fables, and was republished as late\r\nas 1727 by Archdeacon Croxall as the introduction to his edition of\r\nAesop. This life by Planudes contains, however, so small an amount of\r\ntruth, and is so full of absurd pictures of the grotesque deformity\r\nof Aesop, of wondrous apocryphal stories, of lying legends, and gross\r\nanachronisms, that it is now universally condemned as false, puerile,\r\nand unauthentic.[101] It is given up in the present day, by general\r\nconsent, as unworthy of the slightest credit. G.F.T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nTHE TALE, the Parable, and the Fable are all common and popular modes\r\nof conveying instruction. Each is distinguished by its own special\r\ncharacteristics. The Tale consists simply in the narration of a story\r\neither founded on facts, or created solely by the imagination, and\r\nnot necessarily associated with the teaching of any moral lesson. The\r\nParable is the designed use of language purposely intended to convey\r\na hidden and secret meaning other than that contained in the words\r\nthemselves; and which may or may not bear a special reference to the\r\nhearer, or reader. The Fable partly agrees with, and partly differs\r\nfrom both of these. It will contain, like the Tale, a short but real\r\nnarrative; it will seek, like the Parable, to convey a hidden meaning,\r\nand that not so much by the use of language, as by the skilful\r\nintroduction of fictitious characters; and yet unlike to either Tale\r\nor Parable, it will ever keep in view, as its high prerogative, and\r\ninseparable attribute, the great purpose of instruction, and will\r\nnecessarily seek to inculcate some moral maxim, social duty, or\r\npolitical truth. The true Fable, if it rise to its high requirements,\r\never aims at one great end and purpose representation of human motive,\r\nand the improvement of human conduct, and yet it so conceals its design\r\nunder the disguise of fictitious characters, by clothing with speech the\r\nanimals of the field, the birds of the air, the trees of the wood, or\r\nthe beasts of the forest, that the reader shall receive advice without\r\nperceiving the presence of the adviser. Thus the superiority of the\r\ncounsellor, which often renders counsel unpalatable, is kept out of\r\nview, and the lesson comes with the greater acceptance when the reader\r\nis led, unconsciously to himself, to have his sympathies enlisted in\r\nbehalf of what is pure, honorable, and praiseworthy, and to have his\r\nindignation excited against what is low, ignoble, and unworthy. The true\r\nfabulist, therefore, discharges a most important function. He is neither\r\na narrator, nor an allegorist. He is a great teacher, a corrector of\r\nmorals, a censor of vice, and a commender of virtue. In this consists\r\nthe superiority of the Fable over the Tale or the Parable. The\r\nfabulist is to create a laugh, but yet, under a merry guise, to convey\r\ninstruction. Phaedrus, the great imitator of Aesop, plainly indicates\r\nthis double purpose to be the true office of the writer of fables.\r\n\r\n     Duplex libelli dos est: quod risum movet,\r\n     Et quod prudenti vitam consilio monet.\r\n\r\nThe continual observance of this twofold aim creates the charm, and\r\naccounts for the universal favor, of the fables of Aesop. \"The fable,\"\r\nsays Professor K. O. Mueller, \"originated in Greece in an intentional\r\ntravestie of human affairs. The 'ainos,' as its name denotes, is an\r\nadmonition, or rather a reproof veiled, either from fear of an excess\r\nof frankness, or from a love of fun and jest, beneath the fiction of an\r\noccurrence happening among beasts; and wherever we have any ancient and\r\nauthentic account of the Aesopian fables, we find it to be the same.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe construction of a fable involves a minute attention to (1) the\r\nnarration itself; (2) the deduction of the moral; and (3) a careful\r\nmaintenance of the individual characteristics of the fictitious\r\npersonages introduced into it. The narration should relate to one\r\nsimple action, consistent with itself, and neither be overladen with a\r\nmultiplicity of details, nor distracted by a variety of circumstances.\r\nThe moral or lesson should be so plain, and so intimately interwoven\r\nwith, and so necessarily dependent on, the narration, that every reader\r\nshould be compelled to give to it the same undeniable interpretation.\r\nThe introduction of the animals or fictitious characters should be\r\nmarked with an unexceptionable care and attention to their natural\r\nattributes, and to the qualities attributed to them by universal popular\r\nconsent. The Fox should be always cunning, the Hare timid, the Lion\r\nbold, the Wolf cruel, the Bull strong, the Horse proud, and the Ass\r\npatient. Many of these fables are characterized by the strictest\r\nobservance of these rules. They are occupied with one short narrative,\r\nfrom which the moral naturally flows, and with which it is intimately\r\nassociated. \"'Tis the simple manner,\" says Dodsley,[2] \"in which the\r\nmorals of Aesop are interwoven with his fables that distinguishes him,\r\nand gives him the preference over all other mythologists. His 'Mountain\r\ndelivered of a Mouse,' produces the moral of his fable in ridicule of\r\npompous pretenders; and his Crow, when she drops her cheese, lets fall,\r\nas it were by accident, the strongest admonition against the power of\r\nflattery. There is no need of a separate sentence to explain it; no\r\npossibility of impressing it deeper, by that load we too often see of\r\naccumulated reflections.\"[3] An equal amount of praise is due for the\r\nconsistency with which the characters of the animals, fictitiously\r\nintroduced, are marked. While they are made to depict the motives and\r\npassions of men, they retain, in an eminent degree, their own special\r\nfeatures of craft or counsel, of cowardice or courage, of generosity or\r\nrapacity.\r\n\r\nThese terms of praise, it must be confessed, cannot be bestowed on all\r\nthe fables in this collection. Many of them lack that unity of design,\r\nthat close connection of the moral with the narrative, that wise choice\r\nin the introduction of the animals, which constitute the charm and\r\nexcellency of true Aesopian fable. This inferiority of some to others is\r\nsufficiently accounted for in the history of the origin and descent\r\nof these fables. The great bulk of them are not the immediate work of\r\nAesop. Many are obtained from ancient authors prior to the time in which\r\nhe lived. Thus, the fable of the \"Hawk and the Nightingale\" is related\r\nby Hesiod;[4] the \"Eagle wounded by an Arrow, winged with its own\r\nFeathers,\" by Aeschylus;[5] the \"Fox avenging his wrongs on the Eagle,\"\r\nby Archilochus.[6] Many of them again are of later origin, and are to be\r\ntraced to the monks of the middle ages: and yet this collection, though\r\nthus made up of fables both earlier and later than the era of Aesop,\r\nrightfully bears his name, because he composed so large a number (all\r\nframed in the same mould, and conformed to the same fashion, and stamped\r\nwith the same lineaments, image, and superscription) as to secure to\r\nhimself the right to be considered the father of Greek fables, and the\r\nfounder of this class of writing, which has ever since borne his name,\r\nand has secured for him, through all succeeding ages, the position of\r\nthe first of moralists.[7]\r\n\r\nThe fables were in the first instance only narrated by Aesop, and for a\r\nlong time were handed down by the uncertain channel of oral tradition.\r\nSocrates is mentioned by Plato[8] as having employed his time while in\r\nprison, awaiting the return of the sacred ship from Delphos which was to\r\nbe the signal of his death, in turning some of these fables into verse,\r\nbut he thus versified only such as he remembered. Demetrius Phalereus,\r\na philosopher at Athens about 300 B.C., is said to have made the first\r\ncollection of these fables. Phaedrus, a slave by birth or by subsequent\r\nmisfortunes, and admitted by Augustus to the honors of a freedman,\r\nimitated many of these fables in Latin iambics about the commencement of\r\nthe Christian era. Aphthonius, a rhetorician of Antioch, A.D. 315, wrote\r\na treatise on, and converted into Latin prose, some of these fables.\r\nThis translation is the more worthy of notice, as it illustrates a\r\ncustom of common use, both in these and in later times. The rhetoricians\r\nand philosophers were accustomed to give the Fables of Aesop as an\r\nexercise to their scholars, not only inviting them to discuss the moral\r\nof the tale, but also to practice and to perfect themselves thereby in\r\nstyle and rules of grammar, by making for themselves new and various\r\nversions of the fables. Ausonius,[9] the friend of the Emperor\r\nValentinian, and the latest poet of eminence in the Western Empire, has\r\nhanded down some of these fables in verse, which Julianus Titianus, a\r\ncontemporary writer of no great name, translated into prose. Avienus,\r\nalso a contemporary of Ausonius, put some of these fables into Latin\r\nelegiacs, which are given by Nevelet (in a book we shall refer to\r\nhereafter), and are occasionally incorporated with the editions of\r\nPhaedrus.\r\n\r\nSeven centuries elapsed before the next notice is found of the Fables\r\nof Aesop. During this long period these fables seem to have suffered an\r\neclipse, to have disappeared and to have been forgotten; and it is at\r\nthe commencement of the fourteenth century, when the Byzantine emperors\r\nwere the great patrons of learning, and amidst the splendors of an\r\nAsiatic court, that we next find honors paid to the name and memory\r\nof Aesop. Maximus Planudes, a learned monk of Constantinople, made a\r\ncollection of about a hundred and fifty of these fables. Little is known\r\nof his history. Planudes, however, was no mere recluse, shut up in his\r\nmonastery. He took an active part in public affairs. In 1327 A.D. he\r\nwas sent on a diplomatic mission to Venice by the Emperor Andronicus\r\nthe Elder. This brought him into immediate contact with the Western\r\nPatriarch, whose interests he henceforth advocated with so much zeal as\r\nto bring on him suspicion and persecution from the rulers of the Eastern\r\nChurch. Planudes has been exposed to a two-fold accusation. He is\r\ncharged on the one hand with having had before him a copy of Babrias\r\n(to whom we shall have occasion to refer at greater length in the end of\r\nthis Preface), and to have had the bad taste \"to transpose,\" or to turn\r\nhis poetical version into prose: and he is asserted, on the other hand,\r\nnever to have seen the Fables of Aesop at all, but to have himself\r\ninvented and made the fables which he palmed off under the name of\r\nthe famous Greek fabulist. The truth lies between these two extremes.\r\nPlanudes may have invented some few fables, or have inserted some that\r\nwere current in his day; but there is an abundance of unanswerable\r\ninternal evidence to prove that he had an acquaintance with the\r\nveritable fables of Aesop, although the versions he had access to\r\nwere probably corrupt, as contained in the various translations and\r\ndisquisitional exercises of the rhetoricians and philosophers. His\r\ncollection is interesting and important, not only as the parent source\r\nor foundation of the earlier printed versions of Aesop, but as the\r\ndirect channel of attracting to these fables the attention of the\r\nlearned.\r\n\r\nThe eventual re-introduction, however, of these Fables of Aesop to their\r\nhigh place in the general literature of Christendom, is to be looked for\r\nin the West rather than in the East. The calamities gradually thickening\r\nround the Eastern Empire, and the fall of Constantinople, 1453 A.D.\r\ncombined with other events to promote the rapid restoration of learning\r\nin Italy; and with that recovery of learning the revival of an interest\r\nin the Fables of Aesop is closely identified. These fables, indeed,\r\nwere among the first writings of an earlier antiquity that attracted\r\nattention. They took their place beside the Holy Scriptures and the\r\nancient classic authors, in the minds of the great students of that day.\r\nLorenzo Valla, one of the most famous promoters of Italian learning,\r\nnot only translated into Latin the Iliad of Homer and the Histories of\r\nHerodotus and Thucydides, but also the Fables of Aesop.\r\n\r\nThese fables, again, were among the books brought into an extended\r\ncirculation by the agency of the printing press. Bonus Accursius, as\r\nearly as 1475-1480, printed the collection of these fables, made by\r\nPlanudes, which, within five years afterwards, Caxton translated into\r\nEnglish, and printed at his press in West-minster Abbey, 1485.[10] It\r\nmust be mentioned also that the learning of this age has left\r\npermanent traces of its influence on these fables,[11] by causing the\r\ninterpolation with them of some of those amusing stories which were so\r\nfrequently introduced into the public discourses of the great preachers\r\nof those days, and of which specimens are yet to be found in the\r\nextant sermons of Jean Raulin, Meffreth, and Gabriel Barlette.[12] The\r\npublication of this era which most probably has influenced these fables,\r\nis the \"Liber Facetiarum,\"[13] a book consisting of a hundred jests and\r\nstories, by the celebrated Poggio Bracciolini, published A.D. 1471, from\r\nwhich the two fables of the \"Miller, his Son, and the Ass,\" and the \"Fox\r\nand the Woodcutter,\" are undoubtedly selected.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of these fables rapidly spread from Italy into Germany,\r\nand their popularity was increased by the favor and sanction given to\r\nthem by the great fathers of the Reformation, who frequently used them\r\nas vehicles for satire and protest against the tricks and abuses of the\r\nRomish ecclesiastics. The zealous and renowned Camerarius, who took an\r\nactive part in the preparation of the Confession of Augsburgh, found\r\ntime, amidst his numerous avocations, to prepare a version for the\r\nstudents in the university of Tubingen, in which he was a professor.\r\nMartin Luther translated twenty of these fables, and was urged by\r\nMelancthon to complete the whole; while Gottfried Arnold, the celebrated\r\nLutheran theologian, and librarian to Frederick I, king of Prussia,\r\nmentions that the great Reformer valued the Fables of Aesop next after\r\nthe Holy Scriptures. In 1546 A.D. the second printed edition of\r\nthe collection of the Fables made by Planudes, was issued from\r\nthe printing-press of Robert Stephens, in which were inserted some\r\nadditional fables from a MS. in the Bibliotheque du Roy at Paris.\r\n\r\nThe greatest advance, however, towards a re-introduction of the Fables\r\nof Aesop to a place in the literature of the world, was made in the\r\nearly part of the seventeenth century. In the year 1610, a learned\r\nSwiss, Isaac Nicholas Nevelet, sent forth the third printed edition of\r\nthese fables, in a work entitled \"Mythologia Aesopica.\" This was a\r\nnoble effort to do honor to the great fabulist, and was the most perfect\r\ncollection of Aesopian fables ever yet published. It consisted, in\r\naddition to the collection of fables given by Planudes and reprinted in\r\nthe various earlier editions, of one hundred and thirty-six new fables\r\n(never before published) from MSS. in the Library of the Vatican, of\r\nforty fables attributed to Aphthonius, and of forty-three from Babrias.\r\nIt also contained the Latin versions of the same fables by Phaedrus,\r\nAvienus, and other authors. This volume of Nevelet forms a complete\r\n\"Corpus Fabularum Aesopicarum;\" and to his labors Aesop owes his\r\nrestoration to universal favor as one of the wise moralists and great\r\nteachers of mankind. During the interval of three centuries which has\r\nelapsed since the publication of this volume of Nevelet's, no book, with\r\nthe exception of the Holy Scriptures, has had a wider circulation than\r\nAesop's Fables. They have been translated into the greater number of the\r\nlanguages both of Europe and of the East, and have been read, and\r\nwill be read, for generations, alike by Jew, Heathen, Mohammedan, and\r\nChristian. They are, at the present time, not only engrafted into the\r\nliterature of the civilized world, but are familiar as household words\r\nin the common intercourse and daily conversation of the inhabitants of\r\nall countries.\r\n\r\nThis collection of Nevelet's is the great culminating point in the\r\nhistory of the revival of the fame and reputation of Aesopian Fables. It\r\nis remarkable, also, as containing in its preface the germ of an idea,\r\nwhich has been since proved to have been correct by a strange chain of\r\ncircumstances. Nevelet intimates an opinion, that a writer named Babrias\r\nwould be found to be the veritable author of the existing form of\r\nAesopian Fables. This intimation has since given rise to a series of\r\ninquiries, the knowledge of which is necessary, in the present day, to a\r\nfull understanding of the true position of Aesop in connection with the\r\nwritings that bear his name.\r\n\r\nThe history of Babrias is so strange and interesting, that it might\r\nnot unfitly be enumerated among the curiosities of literature. He is\r\ngenerally supposed to have been a Greek of Asia Minor, of one of the\r\nIonic Colonies, but the exact period in which he lived and wrote is\r\nyet unsettled. He is placed, by one critic,[14] as far back as the\r\ninstitution of the Achaian League, B.C. 250; by another as late as the\r\nEmperor Severus, who died A.D. 235; while others make him a contemporary\r\nwith Phaedrus in the time of Augustus. At whatever time he wrote his\r\nversion of Aesop, by some strange accident it seems to have entirely\r\ndisappeared, and to have been lost sight of. His name is mentioned by\r\nAvienus; by Suidas, a celebrated critic, at the close of the eleventh\r\ncentury, who gives in his lexicon several isolated verses of his\r\nversion of the fables; and by John Tzetzes, a grammarian and poet of\r\nConstantinople, who lived during the latter half of the twelfth century.\r\nNevelet, in the preface to the volume which we have described, points\r\nout that the Fables of Planudes could not be the work of Aesop, as they\r\ncontain a reference in two places to \"Holy monks,\" and give a verse\r\nfrom the Epistle of St. James as an \"Epimith\" to one of the fables, and\r\nsuggests Babrias as their author. Francis Vavassor,[15] a learned French\r\njesuit, entered at greater length on this subject, and produced further\r\nproofs from internal evidence, from the use of the word Piraeus in\r\ndescribing the harbour of Athens, a name which was not given till two\r\nhundred years after Aesop, and from the introduction of other modern\r\nwords, that many of these fables must have been at least committed to\r\nwriting posterior to the time of Aesop, and more boldly suggests Babrias\r\nas their author or collector.[16] These various references to Babrias\r\ninduced Dr. Plichard Bentley, at the close of the seventeenth century,\r\nto examine more minutely the existing versions of Aesop's Fables, and\r\nhe maintained that many of them could, with a slight change of words,\r\nbe resolved into the Scazonic[17] iambics, in which Babrias is known\r\nto have written: and, with a greater freedom than the evidence then\r\njustified, he put forth, in behalf of Babrias, a claim to the exclusive\r\nauthorship of these fables. Such a seemingly extravagant theory, thus\r\nroundly asserted, excited much opposition. Dr. Bentley[18] met with an\r\nable antagonist in a member of the University of Oxford, the Hon.\r\nMr. Charles Boyle,[19] afterwards Earl of Orrery. Their letters and\r\ndisputations on this subject, enlivened on both sides with much wit and\r\nlearning, will ever bear a conspicuous place in the literary history of\r\nthe seventeenth century. The arguments of Dr. Bentley were yet further\r\ndefended a few years later by Mr. Thomas Tyrwhitt, a well-read scholar,\r\nwho gave up high civil distinctions that he might devote himself the\r\nmore unreservedly to literary pursuits. Mr. Tyrwhitt published, A.D.\r\n1776, a Dissertation on Babrias, and a collection of his fables in\r\ncholiambic meter found in a MS. in the Bodleian Library at Oxford.\r\nFrancesco de Furia, a learned Italian, contributed further testimony\r\nto the correctness of the supposition that Babrias had made a veritable\r\ncollection of fables by printing from a MS. contained in the Vatican\r\nlibrary several fables never before published. In the year 1844,\r\nhowever, new and unexpected light was thrown upon this subject. A\r\nveritable copy of Babrias was found in a manner as singular as were the\r\nMSS. of Quinctilian's Institutes, and of Cicero's Orations by Poggio in\r\nthe monastery of St. Gall A.D. 1416. M. Menoides, at the suggestion of\r\nM. Villemain, Minister of Public Instruction to King Louis Philippe,\r\nhad been entrusted with a commission to search for ancient MSS., and\r\nin carrying out his instructions he found a MS. at the convent of St.\r\nLaura, on Mount Athos, which proved to be a copy of the long suspected\r\nand wished-for choliambic version of Babrias. This MS. was found to be\r\ndivided into two books, the one containing a hundred and twenty-five,\r\nand the other ninety-five fables. This discovery attracted very general\r\nattention, not only as confirming, in a singular manner, the conjectures\r\nso boldly made by a long chain of critics, but as bringing to light\r\nvaluable literary treasures tending to establish the reputation, and\r\nto confirm the antiquity and authenticity of the great mass of Aesopian\r\nFable. The Fables thus recovered were soon published. They found a most\r\nworthy editor in the late distinguished Sir George Cornewall Lewis,\r\nand a translator equally qualified for his task, in the Reverend James\r\nDavies, M.A., sometime a scholar of Lincoln College, Oxford, and himself\r\na relation of their English editor. Thus, after an eclipse of many\r\ncenturies, Babrias shines out as the earliest, and most reliable\r\ncollector of veritable Aesopian Fables.\r\n\r\nThe following are the sources from which the present translation has\r\nbeen prepared:\r\n\r\n   Babrii Fabulae Aesopeae.

So also the\r\nfables of the \"Swollen Fox\" and of the \"Frogs asking a King\" were spoken\r\nby Aesop for the immediate purpose of reconciling the inhabitants of\r\nSamos and Athens to their respective rulers, Periander and Pisistratus;\r\nwhile the fable of the \"Horse and Stag\" was composed to caution the\r\ninhabitants of Himera against granting a bodyguard to Phalaris. In a\r\nsimilar manner, the fable from Phaedrus, the \"Marriage of the Sun,\" is\r\nsupposed to have reference to the contemplated union of Livia, the\r\ndaughter of Drusus, with Sejanus the favourite, and minister of Trajan.\r\nThese fables, however, though thus originating in special events, and\r\ndesigned at first to meet special circumstances, are so admirably\r\nconstructed as to be fraught with lessons of general utility, and of\r\nuniversal application.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Hesiod.

Bayle has well put this in his account of Aesop. \"Il n'y\r\na point d'apparence que les fables qui portent aujourd'hui son nom\r\nsoient les memes qu'il avait faites; elles viennent bien de lui pour la\r\nplupart, quant a la matiere et la pensee; mais les paroles sont d'un\r\nautre.\" And again, \"C'est donc a Hesiode, que j'aimerais mieux attribuer\r\nla gloire de l'invention; mais sans doute il laissa la chose tres\r\nimparfaite. Esope la perfectionne si heureusement, qu'on l'a regarde\r\ncomme le vrai pere de cette sorte de production.\" M. Bayle.

There are two celebrated works which might by some\r\nbe classed amongst works of this description. The one is the \"Speculum\r\nSapientiae,\" attributed to St. Cyril, Archbishop of Jerusalem, but of a\r\nconsiderably later origin, and existing only in Latin. It is divided\r\ninto four books, and consists of long conversations conducted by\r\nfictitious characters under the figures the beasts of the field and\r\nforest, and aimed at the rebuke of particular classes of men, the\r\nboastful, the proud, the luxurious, the wrathful, &c. None of the\r\nstories are precisely those of Aesop, and none have the concinnity,\r\nterseness, and unmistakable deduction of the lesson intended to be\r\ntaught by the fable, so conspicuous in the great Greek fabulist. The\r\nexact title of the book is this: \"Speculum Sapientiae, B. Cyrilli\r\nEpiscopi: alias quadripartitus apologeticus vocatus, in cujus quidem\r\nproverbiis omnis et totius sapientiae speculum claret et feliciter\r\nincipit.\" The other is a larger work in two volumes, published in the\r\nfourteenth century by Caesar Heisterbach, a Cistercian monk, under the\r\ntitle of \"Dialogus Miraculorum,\" reprinted in 1851. This work consists\r\nof conversations in which many stories are interwoven on all kinds of\r\nsubjects. It has no correspondence with the pure Aesopian fable.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Post-medieval Preachers, by S. Baring-Gould.
