A Not Unnatural Enterprise\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is written from memory, unfortunately. If I could have brought with\r\nme the material I so carefully prepared, this would be a very different\r\nstory. Whole books full of notes, carefully copied records, firsthand\r\ndescriptions, and the pictures--that's the worst loss. We had some\r\nbird's-eyes of the cities and parks; a lot of lovely views of streets,\r\nof buildings, outside and in, and some of those gorgeous gardens, and,\r\nmost important of all, of the women themselves.\r\n\r\nNobody will ever believe how they looked. Descriptions aren't any good\r\nwhen it comes to women, and I never was good at descriptions anyhow. But\r\nit's got to be done somehow; the rest of the world needs to know about\r\nthat country.\r\n\r\nI haven't said where it was for fear some self-appointed missionaries,\r\nor traders, or land-greedy expansionists, will take it upon themselves\r\nto push in. They will not be wanted, I can tell them that, and will fare\r\nworse than we did if they do find it.\r\n\r\nIt began this way. There were three of us, classmates and friends--Terry\r\nO. Nicholson (we used to call him the Old Nick, with good reason), Jeff\r\nMargrave, and I, Vandyck Jennings.\r\n\r\nWe had known each other years and years, and in spite of our differences\r\nwe had a good deal in common. All of us were interested in science.\r\n\r\nTerry was rich enough to do as he pleased. His great aim was\r\nexploration. He used to make all kinds of a row because there was\r\nnothing left to explore now, only patchwork and filling in, he said. He\r\nfilled in well enough--he had a lot of talents--great on mechanics and\r\nelectricity. Had all kinds of boats and motorcars, and was one of the\r\nbest of our airmen.\r\n\r\nWe never could have done the thing at all without Terry.\r\n\r\nJeff Margrave was born to be a poet, a botanist--or both--but his folks\r\npersuaded him to be a doctor instead. He was a good one, for his age,\r\nbut his real interest was in what he loved to call \"the wonders of\r\nscience.\"\r\n\r\nAs for me, sociology's my major. You have to back that up with a lot of\r\nother sciences, of course. I'm interested in them all.\r\n\r\nTerry was strong on facts--geography and meteorology and those; Jeff\r\ncould beat him any time on biology, and I didn't care what it was they\r\ntalked about, so long as it connected with human life, somehow. There\r\nare few things that don't.\r\n\r\nWe three had a chance to join a big scientific expedition. They needed\r\na doctor, and that gave Jeff an excuse for dropping his just opening\r\npractice; they needed Terry's experience, his machine, and his money;\r\nand as for me, I got in through Terry's influence.\r\n\r\nThe expedition was up among the thousand tributaries and enormous\r\nhinterland of a great river, up where the maps had to be made, savage\r\ndialects studied, and all manner of strange flora and fauna expected.\r\n\r\nBut this story is not about that expedition. That was only the merest\r\nstarter for ours.\r\n\r\nMy interest was first roused by talk among our guides. I'm quick at\r\nlanguages, know a good many, and pick them up readily. What with that\r\nand a really good interpreter we took with us, I made out quite a few\r\nlegends and folk myths of these scattered tribes.\r\n\r\nAnd as we got farther and farther upstream, in a dark tangle of rivers,\r\nlakes, morasses, and dense forests, with here and there an unexpected\r\nlong spur running out from the big mountains beyond, I noticed that more\r\nand more of these savages had a story about a strange and terrible Woman\r\nLand in the high distance.\r\n\r\n\"Up yonder,\" \"Over there,\" \"Way up\"--was all the direction they could\r\noffer, but their legends all agreed on the main point--that there was\r\nthis strange country where no men lived--only women and girl children.\r\n\r\nNone of them had ever seen it. It was dangerous, deadly, they said, for\r\nany man to go there. But there were tales of long ago, when some brave\r\ninvestigator had seen it--a Big Country, Big Houses, Plenty People--All\r\nWomen.\r\n\r\nHad no one else gone? Yes--a good many--but they never came back. It was\r\nno place for men--of that they seemed sure.\r\n\r\nI told the boys about these stories, and they laughed at them. Naturally\r\nI did myself. I knew the stuff that savage dreams are made of.\r\n\r\nBut when we had reached our farthest point, just the day before we all\r\nhad to turn around and start for home again, as the best of expeditions\r\nmust in time, we three made a discovery.\r\n\r\nThe main encampment was on a spit of land running out into the main\r\nstream, or what we thought was the main stream. It had the same muddy\r\ncolor we had been seeing for weeks past, the same taste.\r\n\r\nI happened to speak of that river to our last guide, a rather superior\r\nfellow with quick, bright eyes.\r\n\r\nHe told me that there was another river--\"over there, short river, sweet\r\nwater, red and blue.\"\r\n\r\nI was interested in this and anxious to see if I had understood, so I\r\nshowed him a red and blue pencil I carried, and asked again.\r\n\r\nYes, he pointed to the river, and then to the southwestward.\r\n\"River--good water--red and blue.\"\r\n\r\nTerry was close by and interested in the fellow's pointing.\r\n\r\n\"What does he say, Van?\"\r\n\r\nI told him.\r\n\r\nTerry blazed up at once.\r\n\r\n\"Ask him how far it is.\"\r\n\r\nThe man indicated a short journey; I judged about two hours, maybe\r\nthree.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go,\" urged Terry. \"Just us three. Maybe we can really find\r\nsomething. May be cinnabar in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"May be indigo,\" Jeff suggested, with his lazy smile.\r\n\r\nIt was early yet; we had just breakfasted; and leaving word that we'd\r\nbe back before night, we got away quietly, not wishing to be thought\r\ntoo gullible if we failed, and secretly hoping to have some nice little\r\ndiscovery all to ourselves.\r\n\r\nIt was a long two hours, nearer three. I fancy the savage could have\r\ndone it alone much quicker. There was a desperate tangle of wood and\r\nwater and a swampy patch we never should have found our way across\r\nalone. But there was one, and I could see Terry, with compass and\r\nnotebook, marking directions and trying to place landmarks.\r\n\r\nWe came after a while to a sort of marshy lake, very big, so that the\r\ncircling forest looked quite low and dim across it. Our guide told us\r\nthat boats could go from there to our camp--but \"long way--all day.\"\r\n\r\nThis water was somewhat clearer than that we had left, but we could not\r\njudge well from the margin. We skirted it for another half hour or so,\r\nthe ground growing firmer as we advanced, and presently we turned the\r\ncorner of a wooded promontory and saw a quite different country--a\r\nsudden view of mountains, steep and bare.\r\n\r\n\"One of those long easterly spurs,\" Terry said appraisingly. \"May be\r\nhundreds of miles from the range. They crop out like that.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly we left the lake and struck directly toward the cliffs. We\r\nheard running water before we reached it, and the guide pointed proudly\r\nto his river.\r\n\r\nIt was short. We could see where it poured down a narrow vertical\r\ncataract from an opening in the face of the cliff. It was sweet water.\r\nThe guide drank eagerly and so did we.\r\n\r\n\"That's snow water,\" Terry announced. \"Must come from way back in the\r\nhills.\"\r\n\r\nBut as to being red and blue--it was greenish in tint. The guide seemed\r\nnot at all surprised. He hunted about a little and showed us a quiet\r\nmarginal pool where there were smears of red along the border; yes, and\r\nof blue.\r\n\r\nTerry got out his magnifying glass and squatted down to investigate.\r\n\r\n\"Chemicals of some sort--I can't tell on the spot. Look to me like\r\ndyestuffs. Let's get nearer,\" he urged, \"up there by the fall.\"\r\n\r\nWe scrambled along the steep banks and got close to the pool that foamed\r\nand boiled beneath the falling water. Here we searched the border and\r\nfound traces of color beyond dispute. More--Jeff suddenly held up an\r\nunlooked-for trophy.\r\n\r\nIt was only a rag, a long, raveled fragment of cloth. But it was a\r\nwell-woven fabric, with a pattern, and of a clear scarlet that the water\r\nhad not faded. No savage tribe that we had heard of made such fabrics.\r\n\r\nThe guide stood serenely on the bank, well pleased with our excitement.\r\n\r\n\"One day blue--one day red--one day green,\" he told us, and pulled from\r\nhis pouch another strip of bright-hued cloth.\r\n\r\n\"Come down,\" he said, pointing to the cataract. \"Woman Country--up\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\nThen we were interested. We had our rest and lunch right there and\r\npumped the man for further information. He could tell us only what the\r\nothers had--a land of women--no men--babies, but all girls. No place for\r\nmen--dangerous. Some had gone to see--none had come back.\r\n\r\nI could see Terry's jaw set at that. No place for men? Dangerous? He\r\nlooked as if he might shin up the waterfall on the spot. But the guide\r\nwould not hear of going up, even if there had been any possible method\r\nof scaling that sheer cliff, and we had to get back to our party before\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\"They might stay if we told them,\" I suggested.\r\n\r\nBut Terry stopped in his tracks. \"Look here, fellows,\" he said. \"This\r\nis our find. Let's not tell those cocky old professors. Let's go on home\r\nwith 'em, and then come back--just us--have a little expedition of our\r\nown.\"\r\n\r\nWe looked at him, much impressed. There was something attractive to a\r\nbunch of unattached young men in finding an undiscovered country of a\r\nstrictly Amazonian nature.\r\n\r\nOf course we didn't believe the story--but yet!\r\n\r\n\"There is no such cloth made by any of these local tribes,\" I announced,\r\nexamining those rags with great care. \"Somewhere up yonder they spin and\r\nweave and dye--as well as we do.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would mean a considerable civilization, Van. There couldn't be\r\nsuch a place--and not known about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, I don't know. What's that old republic up in the Pyrenees\r\nsomewhere--Andorra? Precious few people know anything about that, and\r\nit's been minding its own business for a thousand years. Then there's\r\nMontenegro--splendid little state--you could lose a dozen Montenegroes\r\nup and down these great ranges.\"\r\n\r\nWe discussed it hotly all the way back to camp. We discussed it with\r\ncare and privacy on the voyage home. We discussed it after that, still\r\nonly among ourselves, while Terry was making his arrangements.\r\n\r\nHe was hot about it. Lucky he had so much money--we might have had to\r\nbeg and advertise for years to start the thing, and then it would have\r\nbeen a matter of public amusement--just sport for the papers.\r\n\r\nBut T. O. Nicholson could fix up his big steam yacht, load his\r\nspecially-made big motorboat aboard, and tuck in a \"dissembled\" biplane\r\nwithout any more notice than a snip in the society column.\r\n\r\nWe had provisions and preventives and all manner of supplies. His\r\nprevious experience stood him in good stead there. It was a very\r\ncomplete little outfit.\r\n\r\nWe were to leave the yacht at the nearest safe port and go up that\r\nendless river in our motorboat, just the three of us and a pilot; then\r\ndrop the pilot when we got to that last stopping place of the previous\r\nparty, and hunt up that clear water stream ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe motorboat we were going to leave at anchor in that wide shallow\r\nlake. It had a special covering of fitted armor, thin but strong, shut\r\nup like a clamshell.\r\n\r\n\"Those natives can't get into it, or hurt it, or move it,\" Terry\r\nexplained proudly. \"We'll start our flier from the lake and leave the\r\nboat as a base to come back to.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we come back,\" I suggested cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"'Fraid the ladies will eat you?\" he scoffed.\r\n\r\n\"We're not so sure about those ladies, you know,\" drawled Jeff. \"There\r\nmay be a contingent of gentlemen with poisoned arrows or something.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't need to go if you don't want to,\" Terry remarked drily.\r\n\r\n\"Go? You'll have to get an injunction to stop me!\" Both Jeff and I were\r\nsure about that.\r\n\r\nBut we did have differences of opinion, all the long way.\r\n\r\nAn ocean voyage is an excellent time for discussion. Now we had no\r\neavesdroppers, we could loll and loaf in our deck chairs and talk and\r\ntalk--there was nothing else to do. Our absolute lack of facts only made\r\nthe field of discussion wider.\r\n\r\n\"We'll leave papers with our consul where the yacht stays,\" Terry\r\nplanned. \"If we don't come back in--say a month--they can send a relief\r\nparty after us.\"\r\n\r\n\"A punitive expedition,\" I urged. \"If the ladies do eat us we must make\r\nreprisals.\"\r\n\r\n\"They can locate that last stopping place easy enough, and I've made a\r\nsort of chart of that lake and cliff and waterfall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but how will they get up?\" asked Jeff.\r\n\r\n\"Same way we do, of course. If three valuable American citizens are lost\r\nup there, they will follow somehow--to say nothing of the glittering\r\nattractions of that fair land--let's call it 'Feminisia,'\" he broke off.\r\n\r\n\"You're right, Terry. Once the story gets out, the river will crawl with\r\nexpeditions and the airships rise like a swarm of mosquitoes.\" I laughed\r\nas I thought of it. \"We've made a great mistake not to let Mr. Yellow\r\nPress in on this. Save us! What headlines!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much!\" said Terry grimly. \"This is our party. We're going to find\r\nthat place alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do with it when you do find it--if you do?\" Jeff\r\nasked mildly.\r\n\r\nJeff was a tender soul. I think he thought that country--if there was\r\none--was just blossoming with roses and babies and canaries and tidies,\r\nand all that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nAnd Terry, in his secret heart, had visions of a sort of sublimated\r\nsummer resort--just Girls and Girls and Girls--and that he was going to\r\nbe--well, Terry was popular among women even when there were other men\r\naround, and it's not to be wondered at that he had pleasant dreams of\r\nwhat might happen. I could see it in his eyes as he lay there, looking\r\nat the long blue rollers slipping by, and fingering that impressive\r\nmustache of his.\r\n\r\nBut I thought--then--that I could form a far clearer idea of what was\r\nbefore us than either of them.\r\n\r\n\"You're all off, boys,\" I insisted. \"If there is such a place--and there\r\ndoes seem some foundation for believing it--you'll find it's built on a\r\nsort of matriarchal principle, that's all. The men have a separate cult\r\nof their own, less socially developed than the women, and make them an\r\nannual visit--a sort of wedding call. This is a condition known to have\r\nexisted--here's just a survival. They've got some peculiarly isolated\r\nvalley or tableland up there, and their primeval customs have survived.\r\nThat's all there is to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about the boys?\" Jeff asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the men take them away as soon as they are five or six, you see.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how about this danger theory all our guides were so sure of?\"\r\n\r\n\"Danger enough, Terry, and we'll have to be mighty careful. Women of\r\nthat stage of culture are quite able to defend themselves and have no\r\nwelcome for unseasonable visitors.\"\r\n\r\nWe talked and talked.\r\n\r\nAnd with all my airs of sociological superiority I was no nearer than\r\nany of them.\r\n\r\nIt was funny though, in the light of what we did find, those extremely\r\nclear ideas of ours as to what a country of women would be like. It\r\nwas no use to tell ourselves and one another that all this was idle\r\nspeculation. We were idle and we did speculate, on the ocean voyage and\r\nthe river voyage, too.\r\n\r\n\"Admitting the improbability,\" we'd begin solemnly, and then launch out\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"They would fight among themselves,\" Terry insisted. \"Women always do.\r\nWe mustn't look to find any sort of order and organization.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're dead wrong,\" Jeff told him. \"It will be like a nunnery under an\r\nabbess--a peaceful, harmonious sisterhood.\"\r\n\r\nI snorted derision at this idea.\r\n\r\n\"Nuns, indeed! Your peaceful sisterhoods were all celibate, Jeff, and\r\nunder vows of obedience. These are just women, and mothers, and where\r\nthere's motherhood you don't find sisterhood--not much.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir--they'll scrap,\" agreed Terry. \"Also we mustn't look for\r\ninventions and progress; it'll be awfully primitive.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about that cloth mill?\" Jeff suggested.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, cloth! Women have always been spinsters. But there they\r\nstop--you'll see.\"\r\n\r\nWe joked Terry about his modest impression that he would be warmly\r\nreceived, but he held his ground.\r\n\r\n\"You'll see,\" he insisted. \"I'll get solid with them all--and play one\r\nbunch against another. I'll get myself elected king in no time--whew!\r\nSolomon will have to take a back seat!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do we come in on that deal?\" I demanded. \"Aren't we Viziers or\r\nanything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't risk it,\" he asserted solemnly. \"You might start a\r\nrevolution--probably would. No, you'll have to be beheaded, or\r\nbowstrung--or whatever the popular method of execution is.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd have to do it yourself, remember,\" grinned Jeff. \"No husky black\r\nslaves and mamelukes! And there'd be two of us and only one of you--eh,\r\nVan?\"\r\n\r\nJeff's ideas and Terry's were so far apart that sometimes it was all\r\nI could do to keep the peace between them. Jeff idealized women in the\r\nbest Southern style. He was full of chivalry and sentiment, and all\r\nthat. And he was a good boy; he lived up to his ideals.\r\n\r\nYou might say Terry did, too, if you can call his views about women\r\nanything so polite as ideals. I always liked Terry. He was a man's man,\r\nvery much so, generous and brave and clever; but I don't think any of\r\nus in college days was quite pleased to have him with our sisters. We\r\nweren't very stringent, heavens no! But Terry was \"the limit.\" Later\r\non--why, of course a man's life is his own, we held, and asked no\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nBut barring a possible exception in favor of a not impossible wife, or\r\nof his mother, or, of course, the fair relatives of his friends, Terry's\r\nidea seemed to be that pretty women were just so much game and homely\r\nones not worth considering.\r\n\r\nIt was really unpleasant sometimes to see the notions he had.\r\n\r\nBut I got out of patience with Jeff, too. He had such rose-colored halos\r\non his womenfolks. I held a middle ground, highly scientific, of course,\r\nand used to argue learnedly about the physiological limitations of the\r\nsex.\r\n\r\nWe were not in the least \"advanced\" on the woman question, any of us,\r\nthen.\r\n\r\nSo we joked and disputed and speculated, and after an interminable\r\njourney, we got to our old camping place at last.\r\n\r\nIt was not hard to find the river, just poking along that side till we\r\ncame to it, and it was navigable as far as the lake.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached that and slid out on its broad glistening bosom, with\r\nthat high gray promontory running out toward us, and the straight white\r\nfall clearly visible, it began to be really exciting.\r\n\r\nThere was some talk, even then, of skirting the rock wall and seeking\r\na possible footway up, but the marshy jungle made that method look not\r\nonly difficult but dangerous.\r\n\r\nTerry dismissed the plan sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, fellows! We've decided that. It might take months--we haven't\r\ngot the provisions. No, sir--we've got to take our chances. If we get\r\nback safe--all right. If we don't, why, we're not the first explorers to\r\nget lost in the shuffle. There are plenty to come after us.\"\r\n\r\nSo we got the big biplane together and loaded it with our scientifically\r\ncompressed baggage: the camera, of course; the glasses; a supply of\r\nconcentrated food. Our pockets were magazines of small necessities, and\r\nwe had our guns, of course--there was no knowing what might happen.\r\n\r\nUp and up and up we sailed, way up at first, to get \"the lay of the\r\nland\" and make note of it.\r\n\r\nOut of that dark green sea of crowding forest this high-standing spur\r\nrose steeply. It ran back on either side, apparently, to the far-off\r\nwhite-crowned peaks in the distance, themselves probably inaccessible.\r\n\r\n\"Let's make the first trip geographical,\" I suggested. \"Spy out the\r\nland, and drop back here for more gasoline. With your tremendous speed\r\nwe can reach that range and back all right. Then we can leave a sort of\r\nmap on board--for that relief expedition.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's sense in that,\" Terry agreed. \"I'll put off being king of\r\nLadyland for one more day.\"\r\n\r\nSo we made a long skirting voyage, turned the point of the cape which\r\nwas close by, ran up one side of the triangle at our best speed, crossed\r\nover the base where it left the higher mountains, and so back to our\r\nlake by moonlight.\r\n\r\n\"That's not a bad little kingdom,\" we agreed when it was roughly drawn\r\nand measured. We could tell the size fairly by our speed. And from what\r\nwe could see of the sides--and that icy ridge at the back end--\"It's a\r\npretty enterprising savage who would manage to get into it,\" Jeff said.\r\n\r\nOf course we had looked at the land itself--eagerly, but we were too\r\nhigh and going too fast to see much. It appeared to be well forested\r\nabout the edges, but in the interior there were wide plains, and\r\neverywhere parklike meadows and open places.\r\n\r\nThere were cities, too; that I insisted. It looked--well, it looked like\r\nany other country--a civilized one, I mean.\r\n\r\nWe had to sleep after that long sweep through the air, but we turned out\r\nearly enough next day, and again we rose softly up the height till\r\nwe could top the crowning trees and see the broad fair land at our\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n\"Semitropical. Looks like a first-rate climate. It's wonderful what a\r\nlittle height will do for temperature.\" Terry was studying the forest\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n\"Little height! Is that what you call little?\" I asked. Our instruments\r\nmeasured it clearly. We had not realized the long gentle rise from the\r\ncoast perhaps.\r\n\r\n\"Mighty lucky piece of land, I call it,\" Terry pursued. \"Now for the\r\nfolks--I've had enough scenery.\"\r\n\r\nSo we sailed low, crossing back and forth, quartering the country as we\r\nwent, and studying it. We saw--I can't remember now how much of this we\r\nnoted then and how much was supplemented by our later knowledge, but we\r\ncould not help seeing this much, even on that excited day--a land in a\r\nstate of perfect cultivation, where even the forests looked as if they\r\nwere cared for; a land that looked like an enormous park, only it was\r\neven more evidently an enormous garden.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see any cattle,\" I suggested, but Terry was silent. We were\r\napproaching a village.\r\n\r\nI confess that we paid small attention to the clean, well-built roads,\r\nto the attractive architecture, to the ordered beauty of the little\r\ntown. We had our glasses out; even Terry, setting his machine for a\r\nspiral glide, clapped the binoculars to his eyes.\r\n\r\nThey heard our whirring screw. They ran out of the houses--they gathered\r\nin from the fields, swift-running light figures, crowds of them. We\r\nstared and stared until it was almost too late to catch the levers,\r\nsweep off and rise again; and then we held our peace for a long run\r\nupward.\r\n\r\n\"Gosh!\" said Terry, after a while.\r\n\r\n\"Only women there--and children,\" Jeff urged excitedly.\r\n\r\n\"But they look--why, this is a CIVILIZED country!\" I protested. \"There\r\nmust be men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course there are men,\" said Terry. \"Come on, let's find 'em.\"\r\n\r\nHe refused to listen to Jeff's suggestion that we examine the country\r\nfurther before we risked leaving our machine.\r\n\r\n\"There's a fine landing place right there where we came over,\" he\r\ninsisted, and it was an excellent one--a wide, flat-topped rock,\r\noverlooking the lake, and quite out of sight from the interior.\r\n\r\n\"They won't find this in a hurry,\" he asserted, as we scrambled with the\r\nutmost difficulty down to safer footing. \"Come on, boys--there were some\r\ngood lookers in that bunch.\"\r\n\r\nOf course it was unwise of us.\r\n\r\nIt was quite easy to see afterward that our best plan was to have\r\nstudied the country more fully before we left our swooping airship and\r\ntrusted ourselves to mere foot service. But we were three young men. We\r\nhad been talking about this country for over a year, hardly believing\r\nthat there was such a place, and now--we were in it.\r\n\r\nIt looked safe and civilized enough, and among those upturned, crowding\r\nfaces, though some were terrified enough, there was great beauty--on\r\nthat we all agreed.\r\n\r\n\"Come on!\" cried Terry, pushing forward. \"Oh, come on! Here goes for\r\nHerland!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. Rash Advances\r\n\r\n\r\nNot more than ten or fifteen miles we judged it from our landing rock to\r\nthat last village. For all our eagerness we thought it wise to keep to\r\nthe woods and go carefully.\r\n\r\nEven Terry's ardor was held in check by his firm conviction that there\r\nwere men to be met, and we saw to it that each of us had a good stock of\r\ncartridges.\r\n\r\n\"They may be scarce, and they may be hidden away somewhere--some kind of\r\na matriarchate, as Jeff tells us; for that matter, they may live up\r\nin the mountains yonder and keep the women in this part of the\r\ncountry--sort of a national harem! But there are men somewhere--didn't\r\nyou see the babies?\"\r\n\r\nWe had all seen babies, children big and little, everywhere that we had\r\ncome near enough to distinguish the people. And though by dress we could\r\nnot be sure of all the grown persons, still there had not been one man\r\nthat we were certain of.\r\n\r\n\"I always liked that Arab saying, 'First tie your camel and then trust\r\nin the Lord,'\" Jeff murmured; so we all had our weapons in hand, and\r\nstole cautiously through the forest. Terry studied it as we progressed.\r\n\r\n\"Talk of civilization,\" he cried softly in restrained enthusiasm. \"I\r\nnever saw a forest so petted, even in Germany. Look, there's not a dead\r\nbough--the vines are trained--actually! And see here\"--he stopped and\r\nlooked about him, calling Jeff's attention to the kinds of trees.\r\n\r\nThey left me for a landmark and made a limited excursion on either side.\r\n\r\n\"Food-bearing, practically all of them,\" they announced returning. \"The\r\nrest, splendid hardwood. Call this a forest? It's a truck farm!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good thing to have a botanist on hand,\" I agreed. \"Sure there are no\r\nmedicinal ones? Or any for pure ornament?\"\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact they were quite right. These towering trees were\r\nunder as careful cultivation as so many cabbages. In other conditions\r\nwe should have found those woods full of fair foresters and fruit\r\ngatherers; but an airship is a conspicuous object, and by no means\r\nquiet--and women are cautious.\r\n\r\nAll we found moving in those woods, as we started through them, were\r\nbirds, some gorgeous, some musical, all so tame that it seemed almost\r\nto contradict our theory of cultivation--at least until we came upon\r\noccasional little glades, where carved stone seats and tables stood in\r\nthe shade beside clear fountains, with shallow bird baths always added.\r\n\r\n\"They don't kill birds, and apparently they do kill cats,\" Terry\r\ndeclared. \"MUST be men here. Hark!\"\r\n\r\nWe had heard something: something not in the least like a birdsong, and\r\nvery much like a suppressed whisper of laughter--a little happy sound,\r\ninstantly smothered. We stood like so many pointers, and then used our\r\nglasses, swiftly, carefully.\r\n\r\n\"It couldn't have been far off,\" said Terry excitedly. \"How about this\r\nbig tree?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a very large and beautiful tree in the glade we had just\r\nentered, with thick wide-spreading branches that sloped out in lapping\r\nfans like a beech or pine. It was trimmed underneath some twenty feet\r\nup, and stood there like a huge umbrella, with circling seats beneath.\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" he pursued. \"There are short stumps of branches left to climb\r\non. There's someone up that tree, I believe.\"\r\n\r\nWe stole near, cautiously.\r\n\r\n\"Look out for a poisoned arrow in your eye,\" I suggested, but Terry\r\npressed forward, sprang up on the seat-back, and grasped the trunk. \"In\r\nmy heart, more likely,\" he answered. \"Gee! Look, boys!\"\r\n\r\nWe rushed close in and looked up. There among the boughs overhead was\r\nsomething--more than one something--that clung motionless, close to the\r\ngreat trunk at first, and then, as one and all we started up the tree,\r\nseparated into three swift-moving figures and fled upward. As we climbed\r\nwe could catch glimpses of them scattering above us. By the time we had\r\nreached about as far as three men together dared push, they had left the\r\nmain trunk and moved outward, each one balanced on a long branch that\r\ndipped and swayed beneath the weight.\r\n\r\nWe paused uncertain. If we pursued further, the boughs would break under\r\nthe double burden. We might shake them off, perhaps, but none of us was\r\nso inclined. In the soft dappled light of these high regions, breathless\r\nwith our rapid climb, we rested awhile, eagerly studying our objects\r\nof pursuit; while they in turn, with no more terror than a set of\r\nfrolicsome children in a game of tag, sat as lightly as so many big\r\nbright birds on their precarious perches and frankly, curiously, stared\r\nat us.\r\n\r\n\"Girls!\" whispered Jeff, under his breath, as if they might fly if he\r\nspoke aloud.\r\n\r\n\"Peaches!\" added Terry, scarcely louder.\r\n\"Peacherinos--apricot-nectarines! Whew!\"\r\n\r\nThey were girls, of course, no boys could ever have shown that sparkling\r\nbeauty, and yet none of us was certain at first.\r\n\r\nWe saw short hair, hatless, loose, and shining; a suit of some light\r\nfirm stuff, the closest of tunics and kneebreeches, met by trim gaiters.\r\nAs bright and smooth as parrots and as unaware of danger, they swung\r\nthere before us, wholly at ease, staring as we stared, till first one,\r\nand then all of them burst into peals of delighted laughter.\r\n\r\nThen there was a torrent of soft talk tossed back and forth; no savage\r\nsing-song, but clear musical fluent speech.\r\n\r\nWe met their laughter cordially, and doffed our hats to them, at which\r\nthey laughed again, delightedly.\r\n\r\nThen Terry, wholly in his element, made a polite speech, with\r\nexplanatory gestures, and proceeded to introduce us, with pointing\r\nfinger. \"Mr. Jeff Margrave,\" he said clearly; Jeff bowed as gracefully\r\nas a man could in the fork of a great limb. \"Mr. Vandyck Jennings\"--I\r\nalso tried to make an effective salute and nearly lost my balance.\r\n\r\nThen Terry laid his hand upon his chest--a fine chest he had, too,\r\nand introduced himself; he was braced carefully for the occasion and\r\nachieved an excellent obeisance.\r\n\r\nAgain they laughed delightedly, and the one nearest me followed his\r\ntactics.\r\n\r\n\"Celis,\" she said distinctly, pointing to the one in blue; \"Alima\"--the\r\none in rose; then, with a vivid imitation of Terry's impressive manner,\r\nshe laid a firm delicate hand on her gold-green jerkin--\"Ellador.\" This\r\nwas pleasant, but we got no nearer.\r\n\r\n\"We can't sit here and learn the language,\" Terry protested. He beckoned\r\nto them to come nearer, most winningly--but they gaily shook their\r\nheads. He suggested, by signs, that we all go down together; but again\r\nthey shook their heads, still merrily. Then Ellador clearly indicated\r\nthat we should go down, pointing to each and all of us, with\r\nunmistakable firmness; and further seeming to imply by the sweep of a\r\nlithe arm that we not only go downward, but go away altogether--at which\r\nwe shook our heads in turn.\r\n\r\n\"Have to use bait,\" grinned Terry. \"I don't know about you fellows,\r\nbut I came prepared.\" He produced from an inner pocket a little box of\r\npurple velvet, that opened with a snap--and out of it he drew a long\r\nsparkling thing, a necklace of big varicolored stones that would have\r\nbeen worth a million if real ones. He held it up, swung it, glittering\r\nin the sun, offered it first to one, then to another, holding it out as\r\nfar as he could reach toward the girl nearest him. He stood braced\r\nin the fork, held firmly by one hand--the other, swinging his bright\r\ntemptation, reached far out along the bough, but not quite to his full\r\nstretch.\r\n\r\nShe was visibly moved, I noted, hesitated, spoke to her companions.\r\nThey chattered softly together, one evidently warning her, the other\r\nencouraging. Then, softly and slowly, she drew nearer. This was Alima,\r\na tall long-limbed lass, well-knit and evidently both strong and agile.\r\nHer eyes were splendid, wide, fearless, as free from suspicion as a\r\nchild's who has never been rebuked. Her interest was more that of\r\nan intent boy playing a fascinating game than of a girl lured by an\r\nornament.\r\n\r\nThe others moved a bit farther out, holding firmly, watching. Terry's\r\nsmile was irreproachable, but I did not like the look in his eyes--it\r\nwas like a creature about to spring. I could already see it happen--the\r\ndropped necklace, the sudden clutching hand, the girl's sharp cry as he\r\nseized her and drew her in. But it didn't happen. She made a timid reach\r\nwith her right hand for the gay swinging thing--he held it a little\r\nnearer--then, swift as light, she seized it from him with her left, and\r\ndropped on the instant to the bough below.\r\n\r\nHe made his snatch, quite vainly, almost losing his position as his\r\nhand clutched only air; and then, with inconceivable rapidity, the three\r\nbright creatures were gone. They dropped from the ends of the big boughs\r\nto those below, fairly pouring themselves off the tree, while we climbed\r\ndownward as swiftly as we could. We heard their vanishing gay laughter,\r\nwe saw them fleeting away in the wide open reaches of the forest, and\r\ngave chase, but we might as well have chased wild antelopes; so we\r\nstopped at length somewhat breathless.\r\n\r\n\"No use,\" gasped Terry. \"They got away with it. My word! The men of this\r\ncountry must be good sprinters!\"\r\n\r\n\"Inhabitants evidently arboreal,\" I grimly suggested. \"Civilized and\r\nstill arboreal--peculiar people.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shouldn't have tried that way,\" Jeff protested. \"They were\r\nperfectly friendly; now we've scared them.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was no use grumbling, and Terry refused to admit any mistake.\r\n\"Nonsense,\" he said. \"They expected it. Women like to be run after. Come\r\non, let's get to that town; maybe we'll find them there. Let's see, it\r\nwas in this direction and not far from the woods, as I remember.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the edge of the open country we reconnoitered with our\r\nfield glasses. There it was, about four miles off, the same town, we\r\nconcluded, unless, as Jeff ventured, they all had pink houses. The broad\r\ngreen fields and closely cultivated gardens sloped away at our feet, a\r\nlong easy slant, with good roads winding pleasantly here and there, and\r\nnarrower paths besides.\r\n\r\n\"Look at that!\" cried Jeff suddenly. \"There they go!\"\r\n\r\nSure enough, close to the town, across a wide meadow, three bright-hued\r\nfigures were running swiftly.\r\n\r\n\"How could they have got that far in this time? It can't be the same\r\nones,\" I urged. But through the glasses we could identify our pretty\r\ntree-climbers quite plainly, at least by costume.\r\n\r\nTerry watched them, we all did for that matter, till they disappeared\r\namong the houses. Then he put down his glass and turned to us, drawing\r\na long breath. \"Mother of Mike, boys--what Gorgeous Girls! To climb like\r\nthat! to run like that! and afraid of nothing. This country suits me all\r\nright. Let's get ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing venture, nothing have,\" I suggested, but Terry preferred \"Faint\r\nheart ne'er won fair lady.\"\r\n\r\nWe set forth in the open, walking briskly. \"If there are any men, we'd\r\nbetter keep an eye out,\" I suggested, but Jeff seemed lost in heavenly\r\ndreams, and Terry in highly practical plans.\r\n\r\n\"What a perfect road! What a heavenly country! See the flowers, will\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\nThis was Jeff, always an enthusiast; but we could agree with him fully.\r\n\r\nThe road was some sort of hard manufactured stuff, sloped slightly to\r\nshed rain, with every curve and grade and gutter as perfect as if it\r\nwere Europe's best. \"No men, eh?\" sneered Terry. On either side a double\r\nrow of trees shaded the footpaths; between the trees bushes or vines,\r\nall fruit-bearing, now and then seats and little wayside fountains;\r\neverywhere flowers.\r\n\r\n\"We'd better import some of these ladies and set 'em to parking the\r\nUnited States,\" I suggested. \"Mighty nice place they've got here.\" We\r\nrested a few moments by one of the fountains, tested the fruit that\r\nlooked ripe, and went on, impressed, for all our gay bravado by the\r\nsense of quiet potency which lay about us.\r\n\r\nHere was evidently a people highly skilled, efficient, caring for their\r\ncountry as a florist cares for his costliest orchids. Under the soft\r\nbrilliant blue of that clear sky, in the pleasant shade of those endless\r\nrows of trees, we walked unharmed, the placid silence broken only by the\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nPresently there lay before us at the foot of a long hill the town or\r\nvillage we were aiming for. We stopped and studied it.\r\n\r\nJeff drew a long breath. \"I wouldn't have believed a collection of\r\nhouses could look so lovely,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"They've got architects and landscape gardeners in plenty, that's sure,\"\r\nagreed Terry.\r\n\r\nI was astonished myself. You see, I come from California, and there's no\r\ncountry lovelier, but when it comes to towns--! I have often groaned\r\nat home to see the offensive mess man made in the face of nature, even\r\nthough I'm no art sharp, like Jeff. But this place! It was built mostly\r\nof a sort of dull rose-colored stone, with here and there some clear\r\nwhite houses; and it lay abroad among the green groves and gardens like\r\na broken rosary of pink coral.\r\n\r\n\"Those big white ones are public buildings evidently,\" Terry declared.\r\n\"This is no savage country, my friend. But no men? Boys, it behooves us\r\nto go forward most politely.\"\r\n\r\nThe place had an odd look, more impressive as we approached. \"It's like\r\nan exposition.\" \"It's too pretty to be true.\" \"Plenty of palaces, but\r\nwhere are the homes?\" \"Oh there are little ones enough--but--.\" It\r\ncertainly was different from any towns we had ever seen.\r\n\r\n\"There's no dirt,\" said Jeff suddenly. \"There's no smoke,\" he added\r\nafter a little.\r\n\r\n\"There's no noise,\" I offered; but Terry snubbed me--\"That's because\r\nthey are laying low for us; we'd better be careful how we go in there.\"\r\n\r\nNothing could induce him to stay out, however, so we walked on.\r\n\r\nEverything was beauty, order, perfect cleanness, and the pleasantest\r\nsense of home over it all. As we neared the center of the town the\r\nhouses stood thicker, ran together as it were, grew into rambling\r\npalaces grouped among parks and open squares, something as college\r\nbuildings stand in their quiet greens.\r\n\r\nAnd then, turning a corner, we came into a broad paved space and\r\nsaw before us a band of women standing close together in even order,\r\nevidently waiting for us.\r\n\r\nWe stopped a moment and looked back. The street behind was closed by\r\nanother band, marching steadily, shoulder to shoulder. We went\r\non--there seemed no other way to go--and presently found ourselves quite\r\nsurrounded by this close-massed multitude, women, all of them, but--\r\n\r\nThey were not young. They were not old. They were not, in the girl\r\nsense, beautiful. They were not in the least ferocious. And yet, as I\r\nlooked from face to face, calm, grave, wise, wholly unafraid, evidently\r\nassured and determined, I had the funniest feeling--a very early\r\nfeeling--a feeling that I traced back and back in memory until I caught\r\nup with it at last. It was that sense of being hopelessly in the wrong\r\nthat I had so often felt in early youth when my short legs' utmost\r\neffort failed to overcome the fact that I was late to school.\r\n\r\nJeff felt it too; I could see he did. We felt like small boys, very\r\nsmall boys, caught doing mischief in some gracious lady's house. But\r\nTerry showed no such consciousness. I saw his quick eyes darting here\r\nand there, estimating numbers, measuring distances, judging chances of\r\nescape. He examined the close ranks about us, reaching back far on every\r\nside, and murmured softly to me, \"Every one of 'em over forty as I'm a\r\nsinner.\"\r\n\r\nYet they were not old women. Each was in the full bloom of rosy health,\r\nerect, serene, standing sure-footed and light as any pugilist. They had\r\nno weapons, and we had, but we had no wish to shoot.\r\n\r\n\"I'd as soon shoot my aunts,\" muttered Terry again. \"What do they\r\nwant with us anyhow? They seem to mean business.\" But in spite of that\r\nbusinesslike aspect, he determined to try his favorite tactics. Terry\r\nhad come armed with a theory.\r\n\r\nHe stepped forward, with his brilliant ingratiating smile, and made low\r\nobeisance to the women before him. Then he produced another tribute, a\r\nbroad soft scarf of filmy texture, rich in color and pattern, a lovely\r\nthing, even to my eye, and offered it with a deep bow to the tall\r\nunsmiling woman who seemed to head the ranks before him. She took it\r\nwith a gracious nod of acknowledgment, and passed it on to those behind\r\nher.\r\n\r\nHe tried again, this time bringing out a circlet of rhinestones, a\r\nglittering crown that should have pleased any woman on earth. He made a\r\nbrief address, including Jeff and me as partners in his enterprise, and\r\nwith another bow presented this. Again his gift was accepted and, as\r\nbefore, passed out of sight.\r\n\r\n\"If they were only younger,\" he muttered between his teeth. \"What on\r\nearth is a fellow to say to a regiment of old Colonels like this?\"\r\n\r\nIn all our discussions and speculations we had always unconsciously\r\nassumed that the women, whatever else they might be, would be young.\r\nMost men do think that way, I fancy.\r\n\r\n\"Woman\" in the abstract is young, and, we assume, charming. As they get\r\nolder they pass off the stage, somehow, into private ownership mostly,\r\nor out of it altogether. But these good ladies were very much on the\r\nstage, and yet any one of them might have been a grandmother.\r\n\r\nWe looked for nervousness--there was none.\r\n\r\nFor terror, perhaps--there was none.\r\n\r\nFor uneasiness, for curiosity, for excitement--and all we saw was what\r\nmight have been a vigilance committee of women doctors, as cool as\r\ncucumbers, and evidently meaning to take us to task for being there.\r\n\r\nSix of them stepped forward now, one on either side of each of us, and\r\nindicated that we were to go with them. We thought it best to accede, at\r\nfirst anyway, and marched along, one of these close at each elbow, and\r\nthe others in close masses before, behind, on both sides.\r\n\r\nA large building opened before us, a very heavy thick-walled impressive\r\nplace, big, and old-looking; of gray stone, not like the rest of the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n\"This won't do!\" said Terry to us, quickly. \"We mustn't let them get us\r\nin this, boys. All together, now--\"\r\n\r\nWe stopped in our tracks. We began to explain, to make signs pointing\r\naway toward the big forest--indicating that we would go back to it--at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nIt makes me laugh, knowing all I do now, to think of us three\r\nboys--nothing else; three audacious impertinent boys--butting into an\r\nunknown country without any sort of a guard or defense. We seemed to\r\nthink that if there were men we could fight them, and if there were only\r\nwomen--why, they would be no obstacles at all.\r\n\r\nJeff, with his gentle romantic old-fashioned notions of women as\r\nclinging vines. Terry, with his clear decided practical theories that\r\nthere were two kinds of women--those he wanted and those he didn't;\r\nDesirable and Undesirable was his demarcation. The latter as a large\r\nclass, but negligible--he had never thought about them at all.\r\n\r\nAnd now here they were, in great numbers, evidently indifferent to\r\nwhat he might think, evidently determined on some purpose of their own\r\nregarding him, and apparently well able to enforce their purpose.\r\n\r\nWe all thought hard just then. It had not seemed wise to object to going\r\nwith them, even if we could have; our one chance was friendliness--a\r\ncivilized attitude on both sides.\r\n\r\nBut once inside that building, there was no knowing what these\r\ndetermined ladies might do to us. Even a peaceful detention was not to\r\nour minds, and when we named it imprisonment it looked even worse.\r\n\r\nSo we made a stand, trying to make clear that we preferred the open\r\ncountry. One of them came forward with a sketch of our flier, asking by\r\nsigns if we were the aerial visitors they had seen.\r\n\r\nThis we admitted.\r\n\r\nThey pointed to it again, and to the outlying country, in different\r\ndirections--but we pretended we did not know where it was, and in\r\ntruth we were not quite sure and gave a rather wild indication of its\r\nwhereabouts.\r\n\r\nAgain they motioned us to advance, standing so packed about the door\r\nthat there remained but the one straight path open. All around us and\r\nbehind they were massed solidly--there was simply nothing to do but go\r\nforward--or fight.\r\n\r\nWe held a consultation.\r\n\r\n\"I never fought with women in my life,\" said Terry, greatly perturbed,\r\n\"but I'm not going in there. I'm not going to be--herded in--as if we\r\nwere in a cattle chute.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't fight them, of course,\" Jeff urged. \"They're all women,\r\nin spite of their nondescript clothes; nice women, too; good strong\r\nsensible faces. I guess we'll have to go in.\"\r\n\r\n\"We may never get out, if we do,\" I told them. \"Strong and sensible,\r\nyes; but I'm not so sure about the good. Look at those faces!\"\r\n\r\nThey had stood at ease, waiting while we conferred together, but never\r\nrelaxing their close attention.\r\n\r\nTheir attitude was not the rigid discipline of soldiers; there was no\r\nsense of compulsion about them. Terry's term of a \"vigilance committee\"\r\nwas highly descriptive. They had just the aspect of sturdy burghers,\r\ngathered hastily to meet some common need or peril, all moved by\r\nprecisely the same feelings, to the same end.\r\n\r\nNever, anywhere before, had I seen women of precisely this quality.\r\nFishwives and market women might show similar strength, but it was\r\ncoarse and heavy. These were merely athletic--light and powerful.\r\nCollege professors, teachers, writers--many women showed similar\r\nintelligence but often wore a strained nervous look, while these were as\r\ncalm as cows, for all their evident intellect.\r\n\r\nWe observed pretty closely just then, for all of us felt that it was a\r\ncrucial moment.\r\n\r\nThe leader gave some word of command and beckoned us on, and the\r\nsurrounding mass moved a step nearer.\r\n\r\n\"We've got to decide quick,\" said Terry.\r\n\r\n\"I vote to go in,\" Jeff urged. But we were two to one against him and he\r\nloyally stood by us. We made one more effort to be let go, urgent, but\r\nnot imploring. In vain.\r\n\r\n\"Now for a rush, boys!\" Terry said. \"And if we can't break 'em, I'll\r\nshoot in the air.\"\r\n\r\nThen we found ourselves much in the position of the suffragette trying\r\nto get to the Parliament buildings through a triple cordon of London\r\npolice.\r\n\r\nThe solidity of those women was something amazing. Terry soon found that\r\nit was useless, tore himself loose for a moment, pulled his revolver,\r\nand fired upward. As they caught at it, he fired again--we heard a\r\ncry--.\r\n\r\nInstantly each of us was seized by five women, each holding arm or leg\r\nor head; we were lifted like children, straddling helpless children, and\r\nborne onward, wriggling indeed, but most ineffectually.\r\n\r\nWe were borne inside, struggling manfully, but held secure most\r\nwomanfully, in spite of our best endeavors.\r\n\r\nSo carried and so held, we came into a high inner hall, gray and bare,\r\nand were brought before a majestic gray-haired woman who seemed to hold\r\na judicial position.\r\n\r\nThere was some talk, not much, among them, and then suddenly there fell\r\nupon each of us at once a firm hand holding a wetted cloth before mouth\r\nand nose--an order of swimming sweetness--anesthesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. A Peculiar Imprisonment\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a slumber as deep as death, as refreshing as that of a healthy\r\nchild, I slowly awakened.\r\n\r\nIt was like rising up, up, up through a deep warm ocean, nearer\r\nand nearer to full light and stirring air. Or like the return to\r\nconsciousness after concussion of the brain. I was once thrown from a\r\nhorse while on a visit to a wild mountainous country quite new to me,\r\nand I can clearly remember the mental experience of coming back to life,\r\nthrough lifting veils of dream. When I first dimly heard the voices of\r\nthose about me, and saw the shining snowpeaks of that mighty range, I\r\nassumed that this too would pass, and I should presently find myself in\r\nmy own home.\r\n\r\nThat was precisely the experience of this awakening: receding waves of\r\nhalf-caught swirling vision, memories of home, the steamer, the boat,\r\nthe airship, the forest--at last all sinking away one after another,\r\ntill my eyes were wide open, my brain clear, and I realized what had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent sensation was of absolute physical comfort. I was\r\nlying in a perfect bed: long, broad, smooth; firmly soft and level; with\r\nthe finest linen, some warm light quilt of blanket, and a counterpane\r\nthat was a joy to the eye. The sheet turned down some fifteen inches,\r\nyet I could stretch my feet at the foot of the bed free but warmly\r\ncovered.\r\n\r\nI felt as light and clean as a white feather. It took me some time to\r\nconscientiously locate my arms and legs, to feel the vivid sense of life\r\nradiate from the wakening center to the extremities.\r\n\r\nA big room, high and wide, with many lofty windows whose closed blinds\r\nlet through soft green-lit air; a beautiful room, in proportion, in\r\ncolor, in smooth simplicity; a scent of blossoming gardens outside.\r\n\r\nI lay perfectly still, quite happy, quite conscious, and yet not\r\nactively realizing what had happened till I heard Terry.\r\n\r\n\"Gosh!\" was what he said.\r\n\r\nI turned my head. There were three beds in this chamber, and plenty of\r\nroom for them.\r\n\r\nTerry was sitting up, looking about him, alert as ever. His remark,\r\nthough not loud, roused Jeff also. We all sat up.\r\n\r\nTerry swung his legs out of bed, stood up, stretched himself mightily.\r\nHe was in a long nightrobe, a sort of seamless garment, undoubtedly\r\ncomfortable--we all found ourselves so covered. Shoes were beside each\r\nbed, also quite comfortable and goodlooking though by no means like our\r\nown.\r\n\r\nWe looked for our clothes--they were not there, nor anything of all the\r\nvaried contents of our pockets.\r\n\r\nA door stood somewhat ajar; it opened into a most attractive bathroom,\r\ncopiously provided with towels, soap, mirrors, and all such convenient\r\ncomforts, with indeed our toothbrushes and combs, our notebooks, and\r\nthank goodness, our watches--but no clothes.\r\n\r\nThen we made a search of the big room again and found a large airy\r\ncloset, holding plenty of clothing, but not ours.\r\n\r\n\"A council of war!\" demanded Terry. \"Come on back to bed--the bed's all\r\nright anyhow. Now then, my scientific friend, let us consider our case\r\ndispassionately.\"\r\n\r\nHe meant me, but Jeff seemed most impressed.\r\n\r\n\"They haven't hurt us in the least!\" he said. \"They could have killed\r\nus--or--or anything--and I never felt better in my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"That argues that they are all women,\" I suggested, \"and highly\r\ncivilized. You know you hit one in the last scrimmage--I heard her sing\r\nout--and we kicked awfully.\"\r\n\r\nTerry was grinning at us. \"So you realize what these ladies have done to\r\nus?\" he pleasantly inquired. \"They have taken away all our possessions,\r\nall our clothes--every stitch. We have been stripped and washed and put\r\nto bed like so many yearling babies--by these highly civilized women.\"\r\n\r\nJeff actually blushed. He had a poetic imagination. Terry had\r\nimagination enough, of a different kind. So had I, also different.\r\nI always flattered myself I had the scientific imagination, which,\r\nincidentally, I considered the highest sort. One has a right to a\r\ncertain amount of egotism if founded on fact--and kept to one's self--I\r\nthink.\r\n\r\n\"No use kicking, boys,\" I said. \"They've got us, and apparently they're\r\nperfectly harmless. It remains for us to cook up some plan of escape\r\nlike any other bottled heroes. Meanwhile we've got to put on these\r\nclothes--Hobson's choice.\"\r\n\r\nThe garments were simple in the extreme, and absolutely comfortable,\r\nphysically, though of course we all felt like supes in the theater.\r\nThere was a one-piece cotton undergarment, thin and soft, that reached\r\nover the knees and shoulders, something like the one-piece pajamas some\r\nfellows wear, and a kind of half-hose, that came up to just under the\r\nknee and stayed there--had elastic tops of their own, and covered the\r\nedges of the first.\r\n\r\nThen there was a thicker variety of union suit, a lot of them in the\r\ncloset, of varying weights and somewhat sturdier material--evidently\r\nthey would do at a pinch with nothing further. Then there were tunics,\r\nknee-length, and some long robes. Needless to say, we took tunics.\r\n\r\nWe bathed and dressed quite cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"Not half bad,\" said Terry, surveying himself in a long mirror. His\r\nhair was somewhat longer than when we left the last barber, and the\r\nhats provided were much like those seen on the prince in the fairy tale,\r\nlacking the plume.\r\n\r\nThe costume was similar to that which we had seen on all the women,\r\nthough some of them, those working in the fields, glimpsed by our\r\nglasses when we first flew over, wore only the first two.\r\n\r\nI settled my shoulders and stretched my arms, remarking: \"They have\r\nworked out a mighty sensible dress, I'll say that for them.\" With which\r\nwe all agreed.\r\n\r\n\"Now then,\" Terry proclaimed, \"we've had a fine long sleep--we've had a\r\ngood bath--we're clothed and in our right minds, though feeling like a\r\nlot of neuters. Do you think these highly civilized ladies are going to\r\ngive us any breakfast?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course they will,\" Jeff asserted confidently. \"If they had meant to\r\nkill us, they would have done it before. I believe we are going to be\r\ntreated as guests.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hailed as deliverers, I think,\" said Terry.\r\n\r\n\"Studied as curiosities,\" I told them. \"But anyhow, we want food. So now\r\nfor a sortie!\"\r\n\r\nA sortie was not so easy.\r\n\r\nThe bathroom only opened into our chamber, and that had but one outlet,\r\na big heavy door, which was fastened.\r\n\r\nWe listened.\r\n\r\n\"There's someone outside,\" Jeff suggested. \"Let's knock.\"\r\n\r\nSo we knocked, whereupon the door opened.\r\n\r\nOutside was another large room, furnished with a great table at one\r\nend, long benches or couches against the wall, some smaller tables\r\nand chairs. All these were solid, strong, simple in structure, and\r\ncomfortable in use--also, incidentally, beautiful.\r\n\r\nThis room was occupied by a number of women, eighteen to be exact, some\r\nof whom we distinctly recalled.\r\n\r\nTerry heaved a disappointed sigh. \"The Colonels!\" I heard him whisper to\r\nJeff.\r\n\r\nJeff, however, advanced and bowed in his best manner; so did we all, and\r\nwe were saluted civilly by the tall-standing women.\r\n\r\nWe had no need to make pathetic pantomime of hunger; the smaller tables\r\nwere already laid with food, and we were gravely invited to be seated.\r\nThe tables were set for two; each of us found ourselves placed vis-a-vis\r\nwith one of our hosts, and each table had five other stalwarts nearby,\r\nunobtrusively watching. We had plenty of time to get tired of those\r\nwomen!\r\n\r\nThe breakfast was not profuse, but sufficient in amount and excellent in\r\nquality. We were all too good travelers to object to novelty, and this\r\nrepast with its new but delicious fruit, its dish of large rich-flavored\r\nnuts, and its highly satisfactory little cakes was most agreeable. There\r\nwas water to drink, and a hot beverage of a most pleasing quality, some\r\npreparation like cocoa.\r\n\r\nAnd then and there, willy-nilly, before we had satisfied our appetites,\r\nour education began.\r\n\r\nBy each of our plates lay a little book, a real printed book, though\r\ndifferent from ours both in paper and binding, as well, of course, as in\r\ntype. We examined them curiously.\r\n\r\n\"Shades of Sauveur!\" muttered Terry. \"We're to learn the language!\"\r\n\r\nWe were indeed to learn the language, and not only that, but to teach\r\nour own. There were blank books with parallel columns, neatly ruled,\r\nevidently prepared for the occasion, and in these, as fast as we learned\r\nand wrote down the name of anything, we were urged to write our own name\r\nfor it by its side.\r\n\r\nThe book we had to study was evidently a schoolbook, one in which\r\nchildren learned to read, and we judged from this, and from their\r\nfrequent consultation as to methods, that they had had no previous\r\nexperience in the art of teaching foreigners their language, or of\r\nlearning any other.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, what they lacked in experience, they made up for\r\nin genius. Such subtle understanding, such instant recognition of our\r\ndifficulties, and readiness to meet them, were a constant surprise to\r\nus.\r\n\r\nOf course, we were willing to meet them halfway. It was wholly to\r\nour advantage to be able to understand and speak with them, and as\r\nto refusing to teach them--why should we? Later on we did try open\r\nrebellion, but only once.\r\n\r\nThat first meal was pleasant enough, each of us quietly studying\r\nhis companion, Jeff with sincere admiration, Terry with that highly\r\ntechnical look of his, as of a past master--like a lion tamer, a serpent\r\ncharmer, or some such professional. I myself was intensely interested.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that those sets of five were there to check any outbreak\r\non our part. We had no weapons, and if we did try to do any damage, with\r\na chair, say, why five to one was too many for us, even if they were\r\nwomen; that we had found out to our sorrow. It was not pleasant, having\r\nthem always around, but we soon got used to it.\r\n\r\n\"It's better than being physically restrained ourselves,\" Jeff\r\nphilosophically suggested when we were alone. \"They've given us a\r\nroom--with no great possibility of escape--and personal liberty--heavily\r\nchaperoned. It's better than we'd have been likely to get in a\r\nman-country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Man-Country! Do you really believe there are no men here, you innocent?\r\nDon't you know there must be?\" demanded Terry.\r\n\r\n\"Ye--es,\" Jeff agreed. \"Of course--and yet--\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet--what! Come, you obdurate sentimentalist--what are you thinking\r\nabout?\"\r\n\r\n\"They may have some peculiar division of labor we've never heard of,\" I\r\nsuggested. \"The men may live in separate towns, or they may have subdued\r\nthem--somehow--and keep them shut up. But there must be some.\"\r\n\r\n\"That last suggestion of yours is a nice one, Van,\" Terry protested.\r\n\"Same as they've got us subdued and shut up! you make me shiver.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, figure it out for yourself, anyway you please. We saw plenty of\r\nkids, the first day, and we've seen those girls--\"\r\n\r\n\"Real girls!\" Terry agreed, in immense relief. \"Glad you mentioned\r\n'em. I declare, if I thought there was nothing in the country but those\r\ngrenadiers I'd jump out the window.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speaking of windows,\" I suggested, \"let's examine ours.\"\r\n\r\nWe looked out of all the windows. The blinds opened easily enough, and\r\nthere were no bars, but the prospect was not reassuring.\r\n\r\nThis was not the pink-walled town we had so rashly entered the day\r\nbefore. Our chamber was high up, in a projecting wing of a sort of\r\ncastle, built out on a steep spur of rock. Immediately below us were\r\ngardens, fruitful and fragrant, but their high walls followed the edge\r\nof the cliff which dropped sheer down, we could not see how far. The\r\ndistant sound of water suggested a river at the foot.\r\n\r\nWe could look out east, west, and south. To the southeastward stretched\r\nthe open country, lying bright and fair in the morning light, but on\r\neither side, and evidently behind, rose great mountains.\r\n\r\n\"This thing is a regular fortress--and no women built it, I can tell\r\nyou that,\" said Terry. We nodded agreeingly. \"It's right up among the\r\nhills--they must have brought us a long way.\"\r\n\r\n\"We saw some kind of swift-moving vehicles the first day,\" Jeff reminded\r\nus. \"If they've got motors, they ARE civilized.\"\r\n\r\n\"Civilized or not, we've got our work cut out for us to get away from\r\nhere. I don't propose to make a rope of bedclothes and try those walls\r\ntill I'm sure there is no better way.\"\r\n\r\nWe all concurred on this point, and returned to our discussion as to the\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nJeff continued thoughtful. \"All the same, there's something funny about\r\nit,\" he urged. \"It isn't just that we don't see any men--but we don't\r\nsee any signs of them. The--the--reaction of these women is different\r\nfrom any that I've ever met.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is something in what you say, Jeff,\" I agreed. \"There is a\r\ndifferent--atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\n\"They don't seem to notice our being men,\" he went on. \"They treat\r\nus--well--just as they do one another. It's as if our being men was a\r\nminor incident.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded. I'd noticed it myself. But Terry broke in rudely.\r\n\r\n\"Fiddlesticks!\" he said. \"It's because of their advanced age. They're\r\nall grandmas, I tell you--or ought to be. Great aunts, anyhow. Those\r\ngirls were girls all right, weren't they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--\" Jeff agreed, still slowly. \"But they weren't afraid--they flew\r\nup that tree and hid, like schoolboys caught out of bounds--not like shy\r\ngirls.\"\r\n\r\n\"And they ran like marathon winners--you'll admit that, Terry,\" he\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nTerry was moody as the days passed. He seemed to mind our confinement\r\nmore than Jeff or I did; and he harped on Alima, and how near he'd come\r\nto catching her. \"If I had--\" he would say, rather savagely, \"we'd have\r\nhad a hostage and could have made terms.\"\r\n\r\nBut Jeff was getting on excellent terms with his tutor, and even his\r\nguards, and so was I. It interested me profoundly to note and study\r\nthe subtle difference between these women and other women, and try to\r\naccount for them. In the matter of personal appearance, there was a\r\ngreat difference. They all wore short hair, some few inches at most;\r\nsome curly, some not; all light and clean and fresh-looking.\r\n\r\n\"If their hair was only long,\" Jeff would complain, \"they would look so\r\nmuch more feminine.\"\r\n\r\nI rather liked it myself, after I got used to it. Why we should so\r\nadmire \"a woman's crown of hair\" and not admire a Chinaman's queue is\r\nhard to explain, except that we are so convinced that the long hair\r\n\"belongs\" to a woman. Whereas the \"mane\" in horses is on both, and in\r\nlions, buffalos, and such creatures only on the male. But I did miss\r\nit--at first.\r\n\r\nOur time was quite pleasantly filled. We were free of the garden below\r\nour windows, quite long in its irregular rambling shape, bordering the\r\ncliff. The walls were perfectly smooth and high, ending in the masonry\r\nof the building; and as I studied the great stones I became convinced\r\nthat the whole structure was extremely old. It was built like the\r\npre-Incan architecture in Peru, of enormous monoliths, fitted as closely\r\nas mosaics.\r\n\r\n\"These folks have a history, that's sure,\" I told the others. \"And SOME\r\ntime they were fighters--else why a fortress?\"\r\n\r\nI said we were free of the garden, but not wholly alone in it. There\r\nwas always a string of those uncomfortably strong women sitting about,\r\nalways one of them watching us even if the others were reading, playing\r\ngames, or busy at some kind of handiwork.\r\n\r\n\"When I see them knit,\" Terry said, \"I can almost call them feminine.\"\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't prove anything,\" Jeff promptly replied. \"Scotch shepherds\r\nknit--always knitting.\"\r\n\r\n\"When we get out--\" Terry stretched himself and looked at the far\r\npeaks, \"when we get out of this and get to where the real women are--the\r\nmothers, and the girls--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what'll we do then?\" I asked, rather gloomily. \"How do you know\r\nwe'll ever get out?\"\r\n\r\nThis was an unpleasant idea, which we unanimously considered, returning\r\nwith earnestness to our studies.\r\n\r\n\"If we are good boys and learn our lessons well,\" I suggested. \"If we\r\nare quiet and respectful and polite and they are not afraid of us--then\r\nperhaps they will let us out. And anyway--when we do escape, it is of\r\nimmense importance that we know the language.\"\r\n\r\nPersonally, I was tremendously interested in that language, and seeing\r\nthey had books, was eager to get at them, to dig into their history, if\r\nthey had one.\r\n\r\nIt was not hard to speak, smooth and pleasant to the ear, and so easy\r\nto read and write that I marveled at it. They had an absolutely phonetic\r\nsystem, the whole thing was as scientific as Esparanto yet bore all the\r\nmarks of an old and rich civilization.\r\n\r\nWe were free to study as much as we wished, and were not left merely to\r\nwander in the garden for recreation but introduced to a great gymnasium,\r\npartly on the roof and partly in the story below. Here we learned real\r\nrespect for our tall guards. No change of costume was needed for this\r\nwork, save to lay off outer clothing. The first one was as perfect a\r\ngarment for exercise as need be devised, absolutely free to move in,\r\nand, I had to admit, much better-looking than our usual one.\r\n\r\n\"Forty--over forty--some of 'em fifty, I bet--and look at 'em!\" grumbled\r\nTerry in reluctant admiration.\r\n\r\nThere were no spectacular acrobatics, such as only the young can\r\nperform, but for all-around development they had a most excellent\r\nsystem. A good deal of music went with it, with posture dancing and,\r\nsometimes, gravely beautiful processional performances.\r\n\r\nJeff was much impressed by it. We did not know then how small a part of\r\ntheir physical culture methods this really was, but found it agreeable\r\nto watch, and to take part in.\r\n\r\nOh yes, we took part all right! It wasn't absolutely compulsory, but we\r\nthought it better to please.\r\n\r\nTerry was the strongest of us, though I was wiry and had good staying\r\npower, and Jeff was a great sprinter and hurdler, but I can tell you\r\nthose old ladies gave us cards and spades. They ran like deer, by which\r\nI mean that they ran not as if it was a performance, but as if it was\r\ntheir natural gait. We remembered those fleeting girls of our first\r\nbright adventure, and concluded that it was.\r\n\r\nThey leaped like deer, too, with a quick folding motion of the legs,\r\ndrawn up and turned to one side with a sidelong twist of the body. I\r\nremembered the sprawling spread-eagle way in which some of the fellows\r\nused to come over the line--and tried to learn the trick. We did not\r\neasily catch up with these experts, however.\r\n\r\n\"Never thought I'd live to be bossed by a lot of elderly lady acrobats,\"\r\nTerry protested.\r\n\r\nThey had games, too, a good many of them, but we found them rather\r\nuninteresting at first. It was like two people playing solitaire to\r\nsee who would get it first; more like a race or a--a competitive\r\nexamination, than a real game with some fight in it.\r\n\r\nI philosophized a bit over this and told Terry it argued against their\r\nhaving any men about. \"There isn't a man-size game in the lot,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"But they are interesting--I like them,\" Jeff objected, \"and I'm sure\r\nthey are educational.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sick and tired of being educated,\" Terry protested. \"Fancy going to\r\na dame school--at our age. I want to Get Out!\"\r\n\r\nBut we could not get out, and we were being educated swiftly. Our\r\nspecial tutors rose rapidly in our esteem. They seemed of rather finer\r\nquality than the guards, though all were on terms of easy friendliness.\r\nMine was named Somel, Jeff's Zava, and Terry's Moadine. We tried to\r\ngeneralize from the names, those of the guards, and of our three girls,\r\nbut got nowhere.\r\n\r\n\"They sound well enough, and they're mostly short, but there's no\r\nsimilarity of termination--and no two alike. However, our acquaintance\r\nis limited as yet.\"\r\n\r\nThere were many things we meant to ask--as soon as we could talk well\r\nenough. Better teaching I never saw. From morning to night there was\r\nSomel, always on call except between two and four; always pleasant with\r\na steady friendly kindness that I grew to enjoy very much. Jeff said\r\nMiss Zava--he would put on a title, though they apparently had none--was\r\na darling, that she reminded him of his Aunt Esther at home; but Terry\r\nrefused to be won, and rather jeered at his own companion, when we were\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sick of it!\" he protested. \"Sick of the whole thing. Here we are\r\ncooped up as helpless as a bunch of three-year-old orphans, and being\r\ntaught what they think is necessary--whether we like it or not. Confound\r\ntheir old-maid impudence!\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless we were taught. They brought in a raised map of their\r\ncountry, beautifully made, and increased our knowledge of geographical\r\nterms; but when we inquired for information as to the country outside,\r\nthey smilingly shook their heads.\r\n\r\nThey brought pictures, not only the engravings in the books but colored\r\nstudies of plants and trees and flowers and birds. They brought tools\r\nand various small objects--we had plenty of \"material\" in our school.\r\n\r\nIf it had not been for Terry we would have been much more contented, but\r\nas the weeks ran into months he grew more and more irritable.\r\n\r\n\"Don't act like a bear with a sore head,\" I begged him. \"We're getting\r\non finely. Every day we can understand them better, and pretty soon we\r\ncan make a reasonable plea to be let out--\"\r\n\r\n\"LET out!\" he stormed. \"LET out--like children kept after school. I want\r\nto Get Out, and I'm going to. I want to find the men of this place and\r\nfight!--or the girls--\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess it's the girls you're most interested in,\" Jeff commented. \"What\r\nare you going to fight WITH--your fists?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--or sticks and stones--I'd just like to!\" And Terry squared off and\r\ntapped Jeff softly on the jaw. \"Just for instance,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Anyhow,\" he went on, \"we could get back to our machine and clear out.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it's there,\" I cautiously suggested.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't croak, Van! If it isn't there, we'll find our way down\r\nsomehow--the boat's there, I guess.\"\r\n\r\nIt was hard on Terry, so hard that he finally persuaded us to consider\r\na plan of escape. It was difficult, it was highly dangerous, but he\r\ndeclared that he'd go alone if we wouldn't go with him, and of course we\r\ncouldn't think of that.\r\n\r\nIt appeared he had made a pretty careful study of the environment. From\r\nour end window that faced the point of the promontory we could get a\r\nfair idea of the stretch of wall, and the drop below. Also from the roof\r\nwe could make out more, and even, in one place, glimpse a sort of path\r\nbelow the wall.\r\n\r\n\"It's a question of three things,\" he said. \"Ropes, agility, and not\r\nbeing seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the hardest part,\" I urged, still hoping to dissuade him. \"One\r\nor another pair of eyes is on us every minute except at night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Therefore we must do it at night,\" he answered. \"That's easy.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've got to think that if they catch us we may not be so well treated\r\nafterward,\" said Jeff.\r\n\r\n\"That's the business risk we must take. I'm going--if I break my neck.\"\r\nThere was no changing him.\r\n\r\nThe rope problem was not easy. Something strong enough to hold a man and\r\nlong enough to let us down into the garden, and then down over the wall.\r\nThere were plenty of strong ropes in the gymnasium--they seemed to love\r\nto swing and climb on them--but we were never there by ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe should have to piece it out from our bedding, rugs, and garments, and\r\nmoreover, we should have to do it after we were shut in for the\r\nnight, for every day the place was cleaned to perfection by two of our\r\nguardians.\r\n\r\nWe had no shears, no knives, but Terry was resourceful. \"These Jennies\r\nhave glass and china, you see. We'll break a glass from the bathroom and\r\nuse that. 'Love will find out a way,'\" he hummed. \"When we're all out of\r\nthe window, we'll stand three-man high and cut the rope as far up as we\r\ncan reach, so as to have more for the wall. I know just where I saw\r\nthat bit of path below, and there's a big tree there, too, or a vine or\r\nsomething--I saw the leaves.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed a crazy risk to take, but this was, in a way, Terry's\r\nexpedition, and we were all tired of our imprisonment.\r\n\r\nSo we waited for full moon, retired early, and spent an anxious hour or\r\ntwo in the unskilled manufacture of man-strong ropes.\r\n\r\nTo retire into the depths of the closet, muffle a glass in thick cloth,\r\nand break it without noise was not difficult, and broken glass will cut,\r\nthough not as deftly as a pair of scissors.\r\n\r\nThe broad moonlight streamed in through four of our windows--we had not\r\ndared leave our lights on too long--and we worked hard and fast at our\r\ntask of destruction.\r\n\r\nHangings, rugs, robes, towels, as well as bed-furniture--even the\r\nmattress covers--we left not one stitch upon another, as Jeff put it.\r\n\r\nThen at an end window, as less liable to observation, we fastened one\r\nend of our cable, strongly, to the firm-set hinge of the inner blind,\r\nand dropped our coiled bundle of rope softly over.\r\n\r\n\"This part's easy enough--I'll come last, so as to cut the rope,\" said\r\nTerry.\r\n\r\nSo I slipped down first, and stood, well braced against the wall; then\r\nJeff on my shoulders, then Terry, who shook us a little as he sawed\r\nthrough the cord above his head. Then I slowly dropped to the ground,\r\nJeff following, and at last we all three stood safe in the garden, with\r\nmost of our rope with us.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, Grandma!\" whispered Terry, under his breath, and we crept\r\nsoftly toward the wall, taking advantage of the shadow of every bush\r\nand tree. He had been foresighted enough to mark the very spot, only a\r\nscratch of stone on stone, but we could see to read in that light. For\r\nanchorage there was a tough, fair-sized shrub close to the wall.\r\n\r\n\"Now I'll climb up on you two again and go over first,\" said Terry.\r\n\"That'll hold the rope firm till you both get up on top. Then I'll go\r\ndown to the end. If I can get off safely, you can see me and follow--or,\r\nsay, I'll twitch it three times. If I find there's absolutely no\r\nfooting--why I'll climb up again, that's all. I don't think they'll kill\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the top he reconnoitered carefully, waved his hand, and whispered,\r\n\"OK,\" then slipped over. Jeff climbed up and I followed, and we rather\r\nshivered to see how far down that swaying, wavering figure dropped, hand\r\nunder hand, till it disappeared in a mass of foliage far below.\r\n\r\nThen there were three quick pulls, and Jeff and I, not without a joyous\r\nsense of recovered freedom, successfully followed our leader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. Our Venture\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were standing on a narrow, irregular, all too slanting little ledge,\r\nand should doubtless have ignominiously slipped off and broken our rash\r\nnecks but for the vine. This was a thick-leaved, wide-spreading thing, a\r\nlittle like Amphelopsis.\r\n\r\n\"It's not QUITE vertical here, you see,\" said Terry, full of pride and\r\nenthusiasm. \"This thing never would hold our direct weight, but I think\r\nif we sort of slide down on it, one at a time, sticking in with hands\r\nand feet, we'll reach that next ledge alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"As we do not wish to get up our rope again--and can't comfortably stay\r\nhere--I approve,\" said Jeff solemnly.\r\n\r\nTerry slid down first--said he'd show us how a Christian meets\r\nhis death. Luck was with us. We had put on the thickest of those\r\nintermediate suits, leaving our tunics behind, and made this scramble\r\nquite successfully, though I got a pretty heavy fall just at the end,\r\nand was only kept on the second ledge by main force. The next stage\r\nwas down a sort of \"chimney\"--a long irregular fissure; and so with\r\nscratches many and painful and bruises not a few, we finally reached the\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nIt was darker there, but we felt it highly necessary to put as much\r\ndistance as possible behind us; so we waded, jumped, and clambered down\r\nthat rocky riverbed, in the flickering black and white moonlight and\r\nleaf shadow, till growing daylight forced a halt.\r\n\r\nWe found a friendly nut-tree, those large, satisfying, soft-shelled nuts\r\nwe already knew so well, and filled our pockets.\r\n\r\nI see that I have not remarked that these women had pockets in\r\nsurprising number and variety. They were in all their garments, and the\r\nmiddle one in particular was shingled with them. So we stocked up with\r\nnuts till we bulged like Prussian privates in marching order, drank all\r\nwe could hold, and retired for the day.\r\n\r\nIt was not a very comfortable place, not at all easy to get at, just\r\na sort of crevice high up along the steep bank, but it was well veiled\r\nwith foliage and dry. After our exhaustive three- or four-hour scramble\r\nand the good breakfast food, we all lay down along that crack--heads and\r\ntails, as it were--and slept till the afternoon sun almost toasted our\r\nfaces.\r\n\r\nTerry poked a tentative foot against my head.\r\n\r\n\"How are you, Van? Alive yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very much so,\" I told him. And Jeff was equally cheerful.\r\n\r\nWe had room to stretch, if not to turn around; but we could very\r\ncarefully roll over, one at a time, behind the sheltering foliage.\r\n\r\nIt was no use to leave there by daylight. We could not see much of the\r\ncountry, but enough to know that we were now at the beginning of the\r\ncultivated area, and no doubt there would be an alarm sent out far and\r\nwide.\r\n\r\nTerry chuckled softly to himself, lying there on that hot narrow little\r\nrim of rock. He dilated on the discomfiture of our guards and tutors,\r\nmaking many discourteous remarks.\r\n\r\nI reminded him that we had still a long way to go before getting to\r\nthe place where we'd left our machine, and no probability of finding it\r\nthere; but he only kicked me, mildly, for a croaker.\r\n\r\n\"If you can't boost, don't knock,\" he protested. \"I never said 'twould\r\nbe a picnic. But I'd run away in the Antarctic ice fields rather than be\r\na prisoner.\"\r\n\r\nWe soon dozed off again.\r\n\r\nThe long rest and penetrating dry heat were good for us, and that night\r\nwe covered a considerable distance, keeping always in the rough forested\r\nbelt of land which we knew bordered the whole country. Sometimes we were\r\nnear the outer edge, and caught sudden glimpses of the tremendous depths\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\n\"This piece of geography stands up like a basalt column,\" Jeff said.\r\n\"Nice time we'll have getting down if they have confiscated our\r\nmachine!\" For which suggestion he received summary chastisement.\r\n\r\nWhat we could see inland was peaceable enough, but only moonlit\r\nglimpses; by daylight we lay very close. As Terry said, we did not wish\r\nto kill the old ladies--even if we could; and short of that they\r\nwere perfectly competent to pick us up bodily and carry us back, if\r\ndiscovered. There was nothing for it but to lie low, and sneak out\r\nunseen if we could do it.\r\n\r\nThere wasn't much talking done. At night we had our marathon-obstacle\r\nrace; we \"stayed not for brake and we stopped not for stone,\" and swam\r\nwhatever water was too deep to wade and could not be got around; but\r\nthat was only necessary twice. By day, sleep, sound and sweet. Mighty\r\nlucky it was that we could live off the country as we did. Even that\r\nmargin of forest seemed rich in foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nBut Jeff thoughtfully suggested that that very thing showed how careful\r\nwe should have to be, as we might run into some stalwart group of\r\ngardeners or foresters or nut-gatherers at any minute. Careful we were,\r\nfeeling pretty sure that if we did not make good this time we were not\r\nlikely to have another opportunity; and at last we reached a point from\r\nwhich we could see, far below, the broad stretch of that still lake from\r\nwhich we had made our ascent.\r\n\r\n\"That looks pretty good to me!\" said Terry, gazing down at it. \"Now, if\r\nwe can't find the 'plane, we know where to aim if we have to drop over\r\nthis wall some other way.\"\r\n\r\nThe wall at that point was singularly uninviting. It rose so straight\r\nthat we had to put our heads over to see the base, and the country below\r\nseemed to be a far-off marshy tangle of rank vegetation. We did not have\r\nto risk our necks to that extent, however, for at last, stealing along\r\namong the rocks and trees like so many creeping savages, we came to that\r\nflat space where we had landed; and there, in unbelievable good fortune,\r\nwe found our machine.\r\n\r\n\"Covered, too, by jingo! Would you think they had that much sense?\"\r\ncried Terry.\r\n\r\n\"If they had that much, they're likely to have more,\" I warned him,\r\nsoftly. \"Bet you the thing's watched.\"\r\n\r\nWe reconnoitered as widely as we could in the failing moonlight--moons\r\nare of a painfully unreliable nature; but the growing dawn showed us\r\nthe familiar shape, shrouded in some heavy cloth like canvas, and no\r\nslightest sign of any watchman near. We decided to make a quick dash as\r\nsoon as the light was strong enough for accurate work.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care if the old thing'll go or not,\" Terry declared. \"We can\r\nrun her to the edge, get aboard, and just plane down--plop!--beside our\r\nboat there. Look there--see the boat!\"\r\n\r\nSure enough--there was our motor, lying like a gray cocoon on the flat\r\npale sheet of water.\r\n\r\nQuietly but swiftly we rushed forward and began to tug at the fastenings\r\nof that cover.\r\n\r\n\"Confound the thing!\" Terry cried in desperate impatience. \"They've got\r\nit sewed up in a bag! And we've not a knife among us!\"\r\n\r\nThen, as we tugged and pulled at that tough cloth we heard a sound that\r\nmade Terry lift his head like a war horse--the sound of an unmistakable\r\ngiggle, yes--three giggles.\r\n\r\nThere they were--Celis, Alima, Ellador--looking just as they had when\r\nwe first saw them, standing a little way off from us, as interested, as\r\nmischievous as three schoolboys.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on, Terry--hold on!\" I warned. \"That's too easy. Look out for a\r\ntrap.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us appeal to their kind hearts,\" Jeff urged. \"I think they will\r\nhelp us. Perhaps they've got knives.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's no use rushing them, anyhow,\" I was absolutely holding on to\r\nTerry. \"We know they can out-run and out-climb us.\"\r\n\r\nHe reluctantly admitted this; and after a brief parley among ourselves,\r\nwe all advanced slowly toward them, holding out our hands in token of\r\nfriendliness.\r\n\r\nThey stood their ground till we had come fairly near, and then indicated\r\nthat we should stop. To make sure, we advanced a step or two and they\r\npromptly and swiftly withdrew. So we stopped at the distance specified.\r\nThen we used their language, as far as we were able, to explain our\r\nplight, telling how we were imprisoned, how we had escaped--a good deal\r\nof pantomime here and vivid interest on their part--how we had traveled\r\nby night and hidden by day, living on nuts--and here Terry pretended\r\ngreat hunger.\r\n\r\nI know he could not have been hungry; we had found plenty to eat and\r\nhad not been sparing in helping ourselves. But they seemed somewhat\r\nimpressed; and after a murmured consultation they produced from their\r\npockets certain little packages, and with the utmost ease and accuracy\r\ntossed them into our hands.\r\n\r\nJeff was most appreciative of this; and Terry made extravagant gestures\r\nof admiration, which seemed to set them off, boy-fashion, to show their\r\nskill. While we ate the excellent biscuits they had thrown us, and while\r\nEllador kept a watchful eye on our movements, Celis ran off to some\r\ndistance, and set up a sort of \"duck-on-a-rock\" arrangement, a big\r\nyellow nut on top of three balanced sticks; Alima, meanwhile, gathering\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nThey urged us to throw at it, and we did, but the thing was a long way\r\noff, and it was only after a number of failures, at which those elvish\r\ndamsels laughed delightedly, that Jeff succeeded in bringing the whole\r\nstructure to the ground. It took me still longer, and Terry, to his\r\nintense annoyance, came third.\r\n\r\nThen Celis set up the little tripod again, and looked back at us,\r\nknocking it down, pointing at it, and shaking her short curls severely.\r\n\"No,\" she said. \"Bad--wrong!\" We were quite able to follow her.\r\n\r\nThen she set it up once more, put the fat nut on top, and returned\r\nto the others; and there those aggravating girls sat and took turns\r\nthrowing little stones at that thing, while one stayed by as a\r\nsetter-up; and they just popped that nut off, two times out of three,\r\nwithout upsetting the sticks. Pleased as Punch they were, too, and we\r\npretended to be, but weren't.\r\n\r\nWe got very friendly over this game, but I told Terry we'd be sorry if\r\nwe didn't get off while we could, and then we begged for knives. It was\r\neasy to show what we wanted to do, and they each proudly produced a sort\r\nof strong clasp-knife from their pockets.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" we said eagerly, \"that's it! Please--\" We had learned quite a\r\nbit of their language, you see. And we just begged for those knives, but\r\nthey would not give them to us. If we came a step too near they backed\r\noff, standing light and eager for flight.\r\n\r\n\"It's no sort of use,\" I said. \"Come on--let's get a sharp stone or\r\nsomething--we must get this thing off.\"\r\n\r\nSo we hunted about and found what edged fragments we could, and hacked\r\naway, but it was like trying to cut sailcloth with a clamshell.\r\n\r\nTerry hacked and dug, but said to us under his breath. \"Boys, we're in\r\npretty good condition--let's make a life and death dash and get hold of\r\nthose girls--we've got to.\"\r\n\r\nThey had drawn rather nearer to watch our efforts, and we did take\r\nthem rather by surprise; also, as Terry said, our recent training had\r\nstrengthened us in wind and limb, and for a few desperate moments those\r\ngirls were scared and we almost triumphant.\r\n\r\nBut just as we stretched out our hands, the distance between us widened;\r\nthey had got their pace apparently, and then, though we ran at our\r\nutmost speed, and much farther than I thought wise, they kept just out\r\nof reach all the time.\r\n\r\nWe stopped breathless, at last, at my repeated admonitions.\r\n\r\n\"This is stark foolishness,\" I urged. \"They are doing it on\r\npurpose--come back or you'll be sorry.\"\r\n\r\nWe went back, much slower than we came, and in truth we were sorry.\r\n\r\nAs we reached our swaddled machine, and sought again to tear loose its\r\ncovering, there rose up from all around the sturdy forms, the quiet\r\ndetermined faces we knew so well.\r\n\r\n\"Oh Lord!\" groaned Terry. \"The Colonels! It's all up--they're forty to\r\none.\"\r\n\r\nIt was no use to fight. These women evidently relied on numbers, not so\r\nmuch as a drilled force but as a multitude actuated by a common impulse.\r\nThey showed no sign of fear, and since we had no weapons whatever and\r\nthere were at least a hundred of them, standing ten deep about us, we\r\ngave in as gracefully as we might.\r\n\r\nOf course we looked for punishment--a closer imprisonment, solitary\r\nconfinement maybe--but nothing of the kind happened. They treated us as\r\ntruants only, and as if they quite understood our truancy.\r\n\r\nBack we went, not under an anesthetic this time but skimming along in\r\nelectric motors enough like ours to be quite recognizable, each of us\r\nin a separate vehicle with one able-bodied lady on either side and three\r\nfacing him.\r\n\r\nThey were all pleasant enough, and talked to us as much as was possible\r\nwith our limited powers. And though Terry was keenly mortified, and at\r\nfirst we all rather dreaded harsh treatment, I for one soon began to\r\nfeel a sort of pleasant confidence and to enjoy the trip.\r\n\r\nHere were my five familiar companions, all good-natured as could be,\r\nseeming to have no worse feeling than a mild triumph as of winning some\r\nsimple game; and even that they politely suppressed.\r\n\r\nThis was a good opportunity to see the country, too, and the more I saw\r\nof it, the better I liked it. We went too swiftly for close observation,\r\nbut I could appreciate perfect roads, as dustless as a swept floor; the\r\nshade of endless lines of trees; the ribbon of flowers that unrolled\r\nbeneath them; and the rich comfortable country that stretched off and\r\naway, full of varied charm.\r\n\r\nWe rolled through many villages and towns, and I soon saw that the\r\nparklike beauty of our first-seen city was no exception. Our swift\r\nhigh-sweeping view from the 'plane had been most attractive, but lacked\r\ndetail; and in that first day of struggle and capture, we noticed\r\nlittle. But now we were swept along at an easy rate of some thirty miles\r\nan hour and covered quite a good deal of ground.\r\n\r\nWe stopped for lunch in quite a sizable town, and here, rolling slowly\r\nthrough the streets, we saw more of the population. They had come out\r\nto look at us everywhere we had passed, but here were more; and when we\r\nwent in to eat, in a big garden place with little shaded tables among\r\nthe trees and flowers, many eyes were upon us. And everywhere, open\r\ncountry, village, or city--only women. Old women and young women and a\r\ngreat majority who seemed neither young nor old, but just women; young\r\ngirls, also, though these, and the children, seeming to be in groups by\r\nthemselves generally, were less in evidence. We caught many glimpses of\r\ngirls and children in what seemed to be schools or in playgrounds, and\r\nso far as we could judge there were no boys. We all looked, carefully.\r\nEveryone gazed at us politely, kindly, and with eager interest. No one\r\nwas impertinent. We could catch quite a bit of the talk now, and all\r\nthey said seemed pleasant enough.\r\n\r\nWell--before nightfall we were all safely back in our big room. The\r\ndamage we had done was quite ignored; the beds as smooth and comfortable\r\nas before, new clothing and towels supplied. The only thing those women\r\ndid was to illuminate the gardens at night, and to set an extra watch.\r\nBut they called us to account next day. Our three tutors, who had not\r\njoined in the recapturing expedition, had been quite busy in preparing\r\nfor us, and now made explanation.\r\n\r\nThey knew well we would make for our machine, and also that there was no\r\nother way of getting down--alive. So our flight had troubled no one; all\r\nthey did was to call the inhabitants to keep an eye on our movements all\r\nalong the edge of the forest between the two points. It appeared that\r\nmany of those nights we had been seen, by careful ladies sitting snugly\r\nin big trees by the riverbed, or up among the rocks.\r\n\r\nTerry looked immensely disgusted, but it struck me as extremely funny.\r\nHere we had been risking our lives, hiding and prowling like outlaws,\r\nliving on nuts and fruit, getting wet and cold at night, and dry and hot\r\nby day, and all the while these estimable women had just been waiting\r\nfor us to come out.\r\n\r\nNow they began to explain, carefully using such words as we could\r\nunderstand. It appeared that we were considered as guests of the\r\ncountry--sort of public wards. Our first violence had made it necessary\r\nto keep us safeguarded for a while, but as soon as we learned the\r\nlanguage--and would agree to do no harm--they would show us all about\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nJeff was eager to reassure them. Of course he did not tell on Terry, but\r\nhe made it clear that he was ashamed of himself, and that he would now\r\nconform. As to the language--we all fell upon it with redoubled energy.\r\nThey brought us books, in greater numbers, and I began to study them\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty punk literature,\" Terry burst forth one day, when we were in\r\nthe privacy of our own room. \"Of course one expects to begin on\r\nchild-stories, but I would like something more interesting now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't expect stirring romance and wild adventure without men, can you?\"\r\nI asked. Nothing irritated Terry more than to have us assume that there\r\nwere no men; but there were no signs of them in the books they gave us,\r\nor the pictures.\r\n\r\n\"Shut up!\" he growled. \"What infernal nonsense you talk! I'm going to\r\nask 'em outright--we know enough now.\"\r\n\r\nIn truth we had been using our best efforts to master the language, and\r\nwere able to read fluently and to discuss what we read with considerable\r\nease.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon we were all sitting together on the roof--we three and\r\nthe tutors gathered about a table, no guards about. We had been made to\r\nunderstand some time earlier that if we would agree to do no violence\r\nthey would withdraw their constant attendance, and we promised most\r\nwillingly.\r\n\r\nSo there we sat, at ease; all in similar dress; our hair, by now, as\r\nlong as theirs, only our beards to distinguish us. We did not want those\r\nbeards, but had so far been unable to induce them to give us any cutting\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\n\"Ladies,\" Terry began, out of a clear sky, as it were, \"are there no men\r\nin this country?\"\r\n\r\n\"Men?\" Somel answered. \"Like you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, men,\" Terry indicated his beard, and threw back his broad\r\nshoulders. \"Men, real men.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she answered quietly. \"There are no men in this country. There has\r\nnot been a man among us for two thousand years.\"\r\n\r\nHer look was clear and truthful and she did not advance this astonishing\r\nstatement as if it was astonishing, but quite as a matter of fact.\r\n\r\n\"But--the people--the children,\" he protested, not believing her in the\r\nleast, but not wishing to say so.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" she smiled. \"I do not wonder you are puzzled. We are\r\nmothers--all of us--but there are no fathers. We thought you would ask\r\nabout that long ago--why have you not?\" Her look was as frankly kind as\r\nalways, her tone quite simple.\r\n\r\nTerry explained that we had not felt sufficiently used to the language,\r\nmaking rather a mess of it, I thought, but Jeff was franker.\r\n\r\n\"Will you excuse us all,\" he said, \"if we admit that we find it hard to\r\nbelieve? There is no such--possibility--in the rest of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you no kind of life where it is possible?\" asked Zava.\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes--some low forms, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"How low--or how high, rather?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--there are some rather high forms of insect life in which it\r\noccurs. Parthenogenesis, we call it--that means virgin birth.\"\r\n\r\nShe could not follow him.\r\n\r\n\"BIRTH, we know, of course; but what is VIRGIN?\"\r\n\r\nTerry looked uncomfortable, but Jeff met the question quite calmly.\r\n\"Among mating animals, the term VIRGIN is applied to the female who has\r\nnot mated,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I see. And does it apply to the male also? Or is there a different\r\nterm for him?\"\r\n\r\nHe passed this over rather hurriedly, saying that the same term would\r\napply, but was seldom used.\r\n\r\n\"No?\" she said. \"But one cannot mate without the other surely. Is not\r\neach then--virgin--before mating? And, tell me, have you any forms of\r\nlife in which there is birth from a father only?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know of none,\" he answered, and I inquired seriously.\r\n\r\n\"You ask us to believe that for two thousand years there have been only\r\nwomen here, and only girl babies born?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" answered Somel, nodding gravely. \"Of course we know that\r\namong other animals it is not so, that there are fathers as well as\r\nmothers; and we see that you are fathers, that you come from a people\r\nwho are of both kinds. We have been waiting, you see, for you to be able\r\nto speak freely with us, and teach us about your country and the rest of\r\nthe world. You know so much, you see, and we know only our own land.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of our previous studies we had been at some pains to tell\r\nthem about the big world outside, to draw sketches, maps, to make a\r\nglobe, even, out of a spherical fruit, and show the size and relation of\r\nthe countries, and to tell of the numbers of their people. All this had\r\nbeen scant and in outline, but they quite understood.\r\n\r\nI find I succeed very poorly in conveying the impression I would like to\r\nof these women. So far from being ignorant, they were deeply wise--that\r\nwe realized more and more; and for clear reasoning, for real brain scope\r\nand power they were A No. 1, but there were a lot of things they did not\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nThey had the evenest tempers, the most perfect patience and good\r\nnature--one of the things most impressive about them all was the absence\r\nof irritability. So far we had only this group to study, but afterward I\r\nfound it a common trait.\r\n\r\nWe had gradually come to feel that we were in the hands of friends, and\r\nvery capable ones at that--but we couldn't form any opinion yet of the\r\ngeneral level of these women.\r\n\r\n\"We want you to teach us all you can,\" Somel went on, her firm shapely\r\nhands clasped on the table before her, her clear quiet eyes meeting\r\nours frankly. \"And we want to teach you what we have that is novel and\r\nuseful. You can well imagine that it is a wonderful event to us, to have\r\nmen among us--after two thousand years. And we want to know about your\r\nwomen.\"\r\n\r\nWhat she said about our importance gave instant pleasure to Terry. I\r\ncould see by the way he lifted his head that it pleased him. But when\r\nshe spoke of our women--someway I had a queer little indescribable\r\nfeeling, not like any feeling I ever had before when \"women\" were\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n\"Will you tell us how it came about?\" Jeff pursued. \"You said 'for two\r\nthousand years'--did you have men here before that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Zava.\r\n\r\nThey were all quiet for a little.\r\n\r\n\"You should have our full history to read--do not be alarmed--it has\r\nbeen made clear and short. It took us a long time to learn how to write\r\nhistory. Oh, how I should love to read yours!\"\r\n\r\nShe turned with flashing eager eyes, looking from one to the other of\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\"It would be so wonderful--would it not? To compare the history of two\r\nthousand years, to see what the differences are--between us, who are\r\nonly mothers, and you, who are mothers and fathers, too. Of course we\r\nsee, with our birds, that the father is as useful as the mother, almost.\r\nBut among insects we find him of less importance, sometimes very little.\r\nIs it not so with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, birds and bugs,\" Terry said, \"but not among animals--have you\r\nNO animals?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have cats,\" she said. \"The father is not very useful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you no cattle--sheep--horses?\" I drew some rough outlines of these\r\nbeasts and showed them to her.\r\n\r\n\"We had, in the very old days, these,\" said Somel, and sketched with\r\nswift sure touches a sort of sheep or llama, \"and these\"--dogs, of two\r\nor three kinds, \"that that\"--pointing to my absurd but recognizable\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n\"What became of them?\" asked Jeff.\r\n\r\n\"We do not want them anymore. They took up too much room--we need all\r\nour land to feed our people. It is such a little country, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever do you do without milk?\" Terry demanded incredulously.\r\n\r\n\"MILK? We have milk in abundance--our own.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--but--I mean for cooking--for grown people,\" Terry blundered, while\r\nthey looked amazed and a shade displeased.\r\n\r\nJeff came to the rescue. \"We keep cattle for their milk, as well as\r\nfor their meat,\" he explained. \"Cow's milk is a staple article of diet.\r\nThere is a great milk industry--to collect and distribute it.\"\r\n\r\nStill they looked puzzled. I pointed to my outline of a cow. \"The farmer\r\nmilks the cow,\" I said, and sketched a milk pail, the stool, and in\r\npantomime showed the man milking. \"Then it is carried to the city and\r\ndistributed by milkmen--everybody has it at the door in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has the cow no child?\" asked Somel earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, of course, a calf, that is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there milk for the calf and you, too?\"\r\n\r\nIt took some time to make clear to those three sweet-faced women the\r\nprocess which robs the cow of her calf, and the calf of its true food;\r\nand the talk led us into a further discussion of the meat business. They\r\nheard it out, looking very white, and presently begged to be excused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. A Unique History\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is no use for me to try to piece out this account with adventures.\r\nIf the people who read it are not interested in these amazing women and\r\ntheir history, they will not be interested at all.\r\n\r\nAs for us--three young men to a whole landful of women--what could we\r\ndo? We did get away, as described, and were peacefully brought back\r\nagain without, as Terry complained, even the satisfaction of hitting\r\nanybody.\r\n\r\nThere were no adventures because there was nothing to fight. There were\r\nno wild beasts in the country and very few tame ones. Of these I might\r\nas well stop to describe the one common pet of the country. Cats, of\r\ncourse. But such cats!\r\n\r\nWhat do you suppose these Lady Burbanks had done with their cats? By the\r\nmost prolonged and careful selection and exclusion they had developed a\r\nrace of cats that did not sing! That's a fact. The most those poor dumb\r\nbrutes could do was to make a kind of squeak when they were hungry or\r\nwanted the door open, and, of course, to purr, and make the various\r\nmother-noises to their kittens.\r\n\r\nMoreover, they had ceased to kill birds. They were rigorously bred to\r\ndestroy mice and moles and all such enemies of the food supply; but the\r\nbirds were numerous and safe.\r\n\r\nWhile we were discussing birds, Terry asked them if they used feathers\r\nfor their hats, and they seemed amused at the idea. He made a few\r\nsketches of our women's hats, with plumes and quills and those various\r\ntickling things that stick out so far; and they were eagerly interested,\r\nas at everything about our women.\r\n\r\nAs for them, they said they only wore hats for shade when working in the\r\nsun; and those were big light straw hats, something like those used in\r\nChina and Japan. In cold weather they wore caps or hoods.\r\n\r\n\"But for decorative purposes--don't you think they would be becoming?\"\r\npursued Terry, making as pretty a picture as he could of a lady with a\r\nplumed hat.\r\n\r\nThey by no means agreed to that, asking quite simply if the men wore the\r\nsame kind. We hastened to assure her that they did not--drew for them\r\nour kind of headgear.\r\n\r\n\"And do no men wear feathers in their hats?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only Indians,\" Jeff explained. \"Savages, you know.\" And he sketched a\r\nwar bonnet to show them.\r\n\r\n\"And soldiers,\" I added, drawing a military hat with plumes.\r\n\r\nThey never expressed horror or disapproval, nor indeed much\r\nsurprise--just a keen interest. And the notes they made!--miles of them!\r\n\r\nBut to return to our pussycats. We were a good deal impressed by this\r\nachievement in breeding, and when they questioned us--I can tell you we\r\nwere well pumped for information--we told of what had been done for dogs\r\nand horses and cattle, but that there was no effort applied to cats,\r\nexcept for show purposes.\r\n\r\nI wish I could represent the kind, quiet, steady, ingenious way they\r\nquestioned us. It was not just curiosity--they weren't a bit more\r\ncurious about us than we were about them, if as much. But they were\r\nbent on understanding our kind of civilization, and their lines of\r\ninterrogation would gradually surround us and drive us in till we found\r\nourselves up against some admissions we did not want to make.\r\n\r\n\"Are all these breeds of dogs you have made useful?\" they asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh--useful! Why, the hunting dogs and watchdogs and sheepdogs are\r\nuseful--and sleddogs of course!--and ratters, I suppose, but we don't\r\nkeep dogs for their USEFULNESS. The dog is 'the friend of man,' we\r\nsay--we love them.\"\r\n\r\nThat they understood. \"We love our cats that way. They surely are our\r\nfriends, and helpers, too. You can see how intelligent and affectionate\r\nthey are.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a fact. I'd never seen such cats, except in a few rare instances.\r\nBig, handsome silky things, friendly with everyone and devotedly\r\nattached to their special owners.\r\n\r\n\"You must have a heartbreaking time drowning kittens,\" we suggested. But\r\nthey said, \"Oh, no! You see we care for them as you do for your valuable\r\ncattle. The fathers are few compared to the mothers, just a few very\r\nfine ones in each town; they live quite happily in walled gardens and\r\nthe houses of their friends. But they only have a mating season once a\r\nyear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather hard on Thomas, isn't it?\" suggested Terry.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no--truly! You see, it is many centuries that we have been breeding\r\nthe kind of cats we wanted. They are healthy and happy and friendly, as\r\nyou see. How do you manage with your dogs? Do you keep them in pairs, or\r\nsegregate the fathers, or what?\"\r\n\r\nThen we explained that--well, that it wasn't a question of fathers\r\nexactly; that nobody wanted a--a mother dog; that, well, that\r\npractically all our dogs were males--there was only a very small\r\npercentage of females allowed to live.\r\n\r\nThen Zava, observing Terry with her grave sweet smile, quoted back at\r\nhim: \"Rather hard on Thomas, isn't it? Do they enjoy it--living without\r\nmates? Are your dogs as uniformly healthy and sweet-tempered as our\r\ncats?\"\r\n\r\nJeff laughed, eyeing Terry mischievously. As a matter of fact we began\r\nto feel Jeff something of a traitor--he so often flopped over and took\r\ntheir side of things; also his medical knowledge gave him a different\r\npoint of view somehow.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry to admit,\" he told them, \"that the dog, with us, is the most\r\ndiseased of any animal--next to man. And as to temper--there are always\r\nsome dogs who bite people--especially children.\"\r\n\r\nThat was pure malice. You see, children were the--the RAISON D'ETRE in\r\nthis country. All our interlocutors sat up straight at once. They were\r\nstill gentle, still restrained, but there was a note of deep amazement\r\nin their voices.\r\n\r\n\"Do we understand that you keep an animal--an unmated male animal--that\r\nbites children? About how many are there of them, please?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thousands--in a large city,\" said Jeff, \"and nearly every family has\r\none in the country.\"\r\n\r\nTerry broke in at this. \"You must not imagine they are all\r\ndangerous--it's not one in a hundred that ever bites anybody. Why, they\r\nare the best friends of the children--a boy doesn't have half a chance\r\nthat hasn't a dog to play with!\"\r\n\r\n\"And the girls?\" asked Somel.\r\n\r\n\"Oh--girls--why they like them too,\" he said, but his voice flatted a\r\nlittle. They always noticed little things like that, we found later.\r\n\r\nLittle by little they wrung from us the fact that the friend of man,\r\nin the city, was a prisoner; was taken out for his meager exercise on\r\na leash; was liable not only to many diseases but to the one destroying\r\nhorror of rabies; and, in many cases, for the safety of the citizens,\r\nhad to go muzzled. Jeff maliciously added vivid instances he had known\r\nor read of injury and death from mad dogs.\r\n\r\nThey did not scold or fuss about it. Calm as judges, those women were.\r\nBut they made notes; Moadine read them to us.\r\n\r\n\"Please tell me if I have the facts correct,\" she said. \"In your\r\ncountry--and in others too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" we admitted, \"in most civilized countries.\"\r\n\r\n\"In most civilized countries a kind of animal is kept which is no longer\r\nuseful--\"\r\n\r\n\"They are a protection,\" Terry insisted. \"They bark if burglars try to\r\nget in.\"\r\n\r\nThen she made notes of \"burglars\" and went on: \"because of the love\r\nwhich people bear to this animal.\"\r\n\r\nZava interrupted here. \"Is it the men or the women who love this animal\r\nso much?\"\r\n\r\n\"Both!\" insisted Terry.\r\n\r\n\"Equally?\" she inquired.\r\n\r\nAnd Jeff said, \"Nonsense, Terry--you know men like dogs better than\r\nwomen do--as a whole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because they love it so much--especially men. This animal is kept shut\r\nup, or chained.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" suddenly asked Somel. \"We keep our father cats shut up because\r\nwe do not want too much fathering; but they are not chained--they have\r\nlarge grounds to run in.\"\r\n\r\n\"A valuable dog would be stolen if he was let loose,\" I said. \"We put\r\ncollars on them, with the owner's name, in case they do stray. Besides,\r\nthey get into fights--a valuable dog might easily be killed by a bigger\r\none.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" she said. \"They fight when they meet--is that common?\" We\r\nadmitted that it was.\r\n\r\n\"They are kept shut up, or chained.\" She paused again, and asked,\r\n\"Is not a dog fond of running? Are they not built for speed?\" That we\r\nadmitted, too, and Jeff, still malicious, enlightened them further.\r\n\r\n\"I've always thought it was a pathetic sight, both ways--to see a man or\r\na woman taking a dog to walk--at the end of a string.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you bred them to be as neat in their habits as cats are?\" was the\r\nnext question. And when Jeff told them of the effect of dogs on sidewalk\r\nmerchandise and the streets generally, they found it hard to believe.\r\n\r\nYou see, their country was as neat as a Dutch kitchen, and as to\r\nsanitation--but I might as well start in now with as much as I\r\ncan remember of the history of this amazing country before further\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nAnd I'll summarize here a bit as to our opportunities for learning it.\r\nI will not try to repeat the careful, detailed account I lost; I'll just\r\nsay that we were kept in that fortress a good six months all told, and\r\nafter that, three in a pleasant enough city where--to Terry's infinite\r\ndisgust--there were only \"Colonels\" and little children--no young women\r\nwhatever. Then we were under surveillance for three more--always with a\r\ntutor or a guard or both. But those months were pleasant because we were\r\nreally getting acquainted with the girls. That was a chapter!--or will\r\nbe--I will try to do justice to it.\r\n\r\nWe learned their language pretty thoroughly--had to; and they learned\r\nours much more quickly and used it to hasten our own studies.\r\n\r\nJeff, who was never without reading matter of some sort, had two little\r\nbooks with him, a novel and a little anthology of verse; and I had one\r\nof those pocket encyclopedias--a fat little thing, bursting with facts.\r\nThese were used in our education--and theirs. Then as soon as we were up\r\nto it, they furnished us with plenty of their own books, and I went in\r\nfor the history part--I wanted to understand the genesis of this miracle\r\nof theirs.\r\n\r\nAnd this is what happened, according to their records.\r\n\r\nAs to geography--at about the time of the Christian era this land had\r\na free passage to the sea. I'm not saying where, for good reasons. But\r\nthere was a fairly easy pass through that wall of mountains behind us,\r\nand there is no doubt in my mind that these people were of Aryan stock,\r\nand were once in contact with the best civilization of the old world.\r\nThey were \"white,\" but somewhat darker than our northern races because\r\nof their constant exposure to sun and air.\r\n\r\nThe country was far larger then, including much land beyond the pass,\r\nand a strip of coast. They had ships, commerce, an army, a king--for at\r\nthat time they were what they so calmly called us--a bi-sexual race.\r\n\r\nWhat happened to them first was merely a succession of historic\r\nmisfortunes such as have befallen other nations often enough. They\r\nwere decimated by war, driven up from their coastline till finally the\r\nreduced population, with many of the men killed in battle, occupied this\r\nhinterland, and defended it for years, in the mountain passes. Where it\r\nwas open to any possible attack from below they strengthened the natural\r\ndefenses so that it became unscalably secure, as we found it.\r\n\r\nThey were a polygamous people, and a slave-holding people, like all of\r\ntheir time; and during the generation or two of this struggle to defend\r\ntheir mountain home they built the fortresses, such as the one we were\r\nheld in, and other of their oldest buildings, some still in use. Nothing\r\nbut earthquakes could destroy such architecture--huge solid blocks,\r\nholding by their own weight. They must have had efficient workmen and\r\nenough of them in those days.\r\n\r\nThey made a brave fight for their existence, but no nation can stand\r\nup against what the steamship companies call \"an act of God.\" While\r\nthe whole fighting force was doing its best to defend their mountain\r\npathway, there occurred a volcanic outburst, with some local tremors,\r\nand the result was the complete filling up of the pass--their only\r\noutlet. Instead of a passage, a new ridge, sheer and high, stood between\r\nthem and the sea; they were walled in, and beneath that wall lay their\r\nwhole little army. Very few men were left alive, save the slaves;\r\nand these now seized their opportunity, rose in revolt, killed their\r\nremaining masters even to the youngest boy, killed the old women too,\r\nand the mothers, intending to take possession of the country with the\r\nremaining young women and girls.\r\n\r\nBut this succession of misfortunes was too much for those infuriated\r\nvirgins. There were many of them, and but few of these would-be masters,\r\nso the young women, instead of submitting, rose in sheer desperation and\r\nslew their brutal conquerors.\r\n\r\nThis sounds like Titus Andronicus, I know, but that is their account. I\r\nsuppose they were about crazy--can you blame them?\r\n\r\nThere was literally no one left on this beautiful high garden land but a\r\nbunch of hysterical girls and some older slave women.\r\n\r\nThat was about two thousand years ago.\r\n\r\nAt first there was a period of sheer despair. The mountains towered\r\nbetween them and their old enemies, but also between them and escape.\r\nThere was no way up or down or out--they simply had to stay there. Some\r\nwere for suicide, but not the majority. They must have been a plucky\r\nlot, as a whole, and they decided to live--as long as they did live.\r\nOf course they had hope, as youth must, that something would happen to\r\nchange their fate.\r\n\r\nSo they set to work, to bury the dead, to plow and sow, to care for one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of burying the dead, I will set down while I think of it, that\r\nthey had adopted cremation in about the thirteenth century, for the same\r\nreason that they had left off raising cattle--they could not spare\r\nthe room. They were much surprised to learn that we were still\r\nburying--asked our reasons for it, and were much dissatisfied with what\r\nwe gave. We told them of the belief in the resurrection of the body, and\r\nthey asked if our God was not as well able to resurrect from ashes as\r\nfrom long corruption. We told them of how people thought it repugnant to\r\nhave their loved ones burn, and they asked if it was less repugnant to\r\nhave them decay. They were inconveniently reasonable, those women.\r\n\r\nWell--that original bunch of girls set to work to clean up the place and\r\nmake their living as best they could. Some of the remaining slave women\r\nrendered invaluable service, teaching such trades as they knew. They\r\nhad such records as were then kept, all the tools and implements of the\r\ntime, and a most fertile land to work in.\r\n\r\nThere were a handful of the younger matrons who had escaped slaughter,\r\nand a few babies were born after the cataclysm--but only two boys, and\r\nthey both died.\r\n\r\nFor five or ten years they worked together, growing stronger and wiser\r\nand more and more mutually attached, and then the miracle happened--one\r\nof these young women bore a child. Of course they all thought there must\r\nbe a man somewhere, but none was found. Then they decided it must be a\r\ndirect gift from the gods, and placed the proud mother in the Temple of\r\nMaaia--their Goddess of Motherhood--under strict watch. And there,\r\nas years passed, this wonder-woman bore child after child, five of\r\nthem--all girls.\r\n\r\nI did my best, keenly interested as I have always been in sociology and\r\nsocial psychology, to reconstruct in my mind the real position of these\r\nancient women. There were some five or six hundred of them, and they\r\nwere harem-bred; yet for the few preceding generations they had been\r\nreared in the atmosphere of such heroic struggle that the stock must\r\nhave been toughened somewhat. Left alone in that terrific orphanhood,\r\nthey had clung together, supporting one another and their little\r\nsisters, and developing unknown powers in the stress of new necessity.\r\nTo this pain-hardened and work-strengthened group, who had lost not only\r\nthe love and care of parents, but the hope of ever having children of\r\ntheir own, there now dawned the new hope.\r\n\r\nHere at last was Motherhood, and though it was not for all of them\r\npersonally, it might--if the power was inherited--found here a new race.\r\n\r\nIt may be imagined how those five Daughters of Maaia, Children of the\r\nTemple, Mothers of the Future--they had all the titles that love and\r\nhope and reverence could give--were reared. The whole little nation\r\nof women surrounded them with loving service, and waited, between a\r\nboundless hope and an equally boundless despair, to see if they, too,\r\nwould be mothers.\r\n\r\nAnd they were! As fast as they reached the age of twenty-five they began\r\nbearing. Each of them, like her mother, bore five daughters. Presently\r\nthere were twenty-five New Women, Mothers in their own right, and the\r\nwhole spirit of the country changed from mourning and mere courageous\r\nresignation to proud joy. The older women, those who remembered men,\r\ndied off; the youngest of all the first lot of course died too, after\r\na while, and by that time there were left one hundred and fifty-five\r\nparthenogenetic women, founding a new race.\r\n\r\nThey inherited all that the devoted care of that declining band of\r\noriginal ones could leave them. Their little country was quite safe.\r\nTheir farms and gardens were all in full production. Such industries\r\nas they had were in careful order. The records of their past were all\r\npreserved, and for years the older women had spent their time in the\r\nbest teaching they were capable of, that they might leave to the little\r\ngroup of sisters and mothers all they possessed of skill and knowledge.\r\n\r\nThere you have the start of Herland! One family, all descended from one\r\nmother! She lived to a hundred years old; lived to see her hundred and\r\ntwenty-five great-granddaughters born; lived as Queen-Priestess-Mother\r\nof them all; and died with a nobler pride and a fuller joy than perhaps\r\nany human soul has ever known--she alone had founded a new race!\r\n\r\nThe first five daughters had grown up in an atmosphere of holy calm,\r\nof awed watchful waiting, of breathless prayer. To them the longed-for\r\nmotherhood was not only a personal joy, but a nation's hope. Their\r\ntwenty-five daughters in turn, with a stronger hope, a richer, wider\r\noutlook, with the devoted love and care of all the surviving population,\r\ngrew up as a holy sisterhood, their whole ardent youth looking\r\nforward to their great office. And at last they were left alone; the\r\nwhite-haired First Mother was gone, and this one family, five sisters,\r\ntwenty-five first cousins, and a hundred and twenty-five second cousins,\r\nbegan a new race.\r\n\r\nHere you have human beings, unquestionably, but what we were slow in\r\nunderstanding was how these ultra-women, inheriting only from women, had\r\neliminated not only certain masculine characteristics, which of\r\ncourse we did not look for, but so much of what we had always thought\r\nessentially feminine.\r\n\r\nThe tradition of men as guardians and protectors had quite died out.\r\nThese stalwart virgins had no men to fear and therefore no need of\r\nprotection. As to wild beasts--there were none in their sheltered land.\r\n\r\nThe power of mother-love, that maternal instinct we so highly laud, was\r\ntheirs of course, raised to its highest power; and a sister-love which,\r\neven while recognizing the actual relationship, we found it hard to\r\ncredit.\r\n\r\nTerry, incredulous, even contemptuous, when we were alone, refused to\r\nbelieve the story. \"A lot of traditions as old as Herodotus--and\r\nabout as trustworthy!\" he said. \"It's likely women--just a pack of\r\nwomen--would have hung together like that! We all know women can't\r\norganize--that they scrap like anything--are frightfully jealous.\"\r\n\r\n\"But these New Ladies didn't have anyone to be jealous of, remember,\"\r\ndrawled Jeff.\r\n\r\n\"That's a likely story,\" Terry sneered.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you invent a likelier one?\" I asked him. \"Here ARE the\r\nwomen--nothing but women, and you yourself admit there's no trace of a\r\nman in the country.\" This was after we had been about a good deal.\r\n\r\n\"I'll admit that,\" he growled. \"And it's a big miss, too. There's not\r\nonly no fun without 'em--no real sport--no competition; but these women\r\naren't WOMANLY. You know they aren't.\"\r\n\r\nThat kind of talk always set Jeff going; and I gradually grew to side\r\nwith him. \"Then you don't call a breed of women whose one concern is\r\nmotherhood--womanly?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I don't,\" snapped Terry. \"What does a man care for\r\nmotherhood--when he hasn't a ghost of a chance at fatherhood? And\r\nbesides--what's the good of talking sentiment when we are just men\r\ntogether? What a man wants of women is a good deal more than all this\r\n'motherhood'!\"\r\n\r\nWe were as patient as possible with Terry. He had lived about nine\r\nmonths among the \"Colonels\" when he made that outburst; and with\r\nno chance at any more strenuous excitement than our gymnastics gave\r\nus--save for our escape fiasco. I don't suppose Terry had ever lived so\r\nlong with neither Love, Combat, nor Danger to employ his superabundant\r\nenergies, and he was irritable. Neither Jeff nor I found it so wearing.\r\nI was so much interested intellectually that our confinement did not\r\nwear on me; and as for Jeff, bless his heart!--he enjoyed the society of\r\nthat tutor of his almost as much as if she had been a girl--I don't know\r\nbut more.\r\n\r\nAs to Terry's criticism, it was true. These women, whose essential\r\ndistinction of motherhood was the dominant note of their whole culture,\r\nwere strikingly deficient in what we call \"femininity.\" This led me very\r\npromptly to the conviction that those \"feminine charms\" we are so fond\r\nof are not feminine at all, but mere reflected masculinity--developed to\r\nplease us because they had to please us, and in no way essential to\r\nthe real fulfillment of their great process. But Terry came to no such\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\n\"Just you wait till I get out!\" he muttered.\r\n\r\nThen we both cautioned him. \"Look here, Terry, my boy! You be careful!\r\nThey've been mighty good to us--but do you remember the anesthesia? If\r\nyou do any mischief in this virgin land, beware of the vengeance of the\r\nMaiden Aunts! Come, be a man! It won't be forever.\"\r\n\r\nTo return to the history:\r\n\r\nThey began at once to plan and built for their children, all the\r\nstrength and intelligence of the whole of them devoted to that one\r\nthing. Each girl, of course, was reared in full knowledge of her\r\nCrowning Office, and they had, even then, very high ideas of the molding\r\npowers of the mother, as well as those of education.\r\n\r\nSuch high ideals as they had! Beauty, Health, Strength, Intellect,\r\nGoodness--for those they prayed and worked.\r\n\r\nThey had no enemies; they themselves were all sisters and friends. The\r\nland was fair before them, and a great future began to form itself in\r\ntheir minds.\r\n\r\nThe religion they had to begin with was much like that of old Greece--a\r\nnumber of gods and goddesses; but they lost all interest in deities\r\nof war and plunder, and gradually centered on their Mother Goddess\r\naltogether. Then, as they grew more intelligent, this had turned into a\r\nsort of Maternal Pantheism.\r\n\r\nHere was Mother Earth, bearing fruit. All that they ate was fruit of\r\nmotherhood, from seed or egg or their product. By motherhood they were\r\nborn and by motherhood they lived--life was, to them, just the long\r\ncycle of motherhood.\r\n\r\nBut very early they recognized the need of improvement as well as\r\nof mere repetition, and devoted their combined intelligence to that\r\nproblem--how to make the best kind of people. First this was merely the\r\nhope of bearing better ones, and then they recognized that however\r\nthe children differed at birth, the real growth lay later--through\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nThen things began to hum.\r\n\r\nAs I learned more and more to appreciate what these women had\r\naccomplished, the less proud I was of what we, with all our manhood, had\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nYou see, they had had no wars. They had had no kings, and no priests,\r\nand no aristocracies. They were sisters, and as they grew, they grew\r\ntogether--not by competition, but by united action.\r\n\r\nWe tried to put in a good word for competition, and they were keenly\r\ninterested. Indeed, we soon found from their earnest questions of us\r\nthat they were prepared to believe our world must be better than theirs.\r\nThey were not sure; they wanted to know; but there was no such arrogance\r\nabout them as might have been expected.\r\n\r\nWe rather spread ourselves, telling of the advantages of competition:\r\nhow it developed fine qualities; that without it there would be \"no\r\nstimulus to industry.\" Terry was very strong on that point.\r\n\r\n\"No stimulus to industry,\" they repeated, with that puzzled look we had\r\nlearned to know so well. \"STIMULUS? TO INDUSTRY? But don't you LIKE to\r\nwork?\"\r\n\r\n\"No man would work unless he had to,\" Terry declared.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no MAN! You mean that is one of your sex distinctions?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed!\" he said hastily. \"No one, I mean, man or woman, would work\r\nwithout incentive. Competition is the--the motor power, you see.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not with us,\" they explained gently, \"so it is hard for us to\r\nunderstand. Do you mean, for instance, that with you no mother would\r\nwork for her children without the stimulus of competition?\"\r\n\r\nNo, he admitted that he did not mean that. Mothers, he supposed, would\r\nof course work for their children in the home; but the world's work\r\nwas different--that had to be done by men, and required the competitive\r\nelement.\r\n\r\nAll our teachers were eagerly interested.\r\n\r\n\"We want so much to know--you have the whole world to tell us of, and we\r\nhave only our little land! And there are two of you--the two sexes--to\r\nlove and help one another. It must be a rich and wonderful world. Tell\r\nus--what is the work of the world, that men do--which we have not here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, everything,\" Terry said grandly. \"The men do everything, with us.\"\r\nHe squared his broad shoulders and lifted his chest. \"We do not allow\r\nour women to work. Women are loved--idolized--honored--kept in the home\r\nto care for the children.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is 'the home'?\" asked Somel a little wistfully.\r\n\r\nBut Zava begged: \"Tell me first, do NO women work, really?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes,\" Terry admitted. \"Some have to, of the poorer sort.\"\r\n\r\n\"About how many--in your country?\"\r\n\r\n\"About seven or eight million,\" said Jeff, as mischievous as ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. Comparisons Are Odious\r\n\r\n\r\nI had always been proud of my country, of course. Everyone is. Compared\r\nwith the other lands and other races I knew, the United States of\r\nAmerica had always seemed to me, speaking modestly, as good as the best\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nBut just as a clear-eyed, intelligent, perfectly honest, and\r\nwell-meaning child will frequently jar one's self-esteem by innocent\r\nquestions, so did these women, without the slightest appearance of\r\nmalice or satire, continually bring up points of discussion which we\r\nspent our best efforts in evading.\r\n\r\nNow that we were fairly proficient in their language, had read a lot\r\nabout their history, and had given them the general outlines of ours,\r\nthey were able to press their questions closer.\r\n\r\nSo when Jeff admitted the number of \"women wage earners\" we had, they\r\ninstantly asked for the total population, for the proportion of adult\r\nwomen, and found that there were but twenty million or so at the\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n\"Then at least a third of your women are--what is it you call them--wage\r\nearners? And they are all POOR. What is POOR, exactly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ours is the best country in the world as to poverty,\" Terry told them.\r\n\"We do not have the wretched paupers and beggars of the older countries,\r\nI assure you. Why, European visitors tell us, we don't know what poverty\r\nis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither do we,\" answered Zava. \"Won't you tell us?\"\r\n\r\nTerry put it up to me, saying I was the sociologist, and I explained\r\nthat the laws of nature require a struggle for existence, and that in\r\nthe struggle the fittest survive, and the unfit perish. In our economic\r\nstruggle, I continued, there was always plenty of opportunity for the\r\nfittest to reach the top, which they did, in great numbers, particularly\r\nin our country; that where there was severe economic pressure the lowest\r\nclasses of course felt it the worst, and that among the poorest of all\r\nthe women were driven into the labor market by necessity.\r\n\r\nThey listened closely, with the usual note-taking.\r\n\r\n\"About one-third, then, belong to the poorest class,\" observed Moadine\r\ngravely. \"And two-thirds are the ones who are--how was it you so\r\nbeautifully put it?--'loved, honored, kept in the home to care for the\r\nchildren.' This inferior one-third have no children, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\nJeff--he was getting as bad as they were--solemnly replied that, on the\r\ncontrary, the poorer they were, the more children they had. That too, he\r\nexplained, was a law of nature: \"Reproduction is in inverse proportion\r\nto individuation.\"\r\n\r\n\"These 'laws of nature,'\" Zava gently asked, \"are they all the laws you\r\nhave?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say not!\" protested Terry. \"We have systems of law that go\r\nback thousands and thousands of years--just as you do, no doubt,\" he\r\nfinished politely.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no,\" Moadine told him. \"We have no laws over a hundred years old,\r\nand most of them are under twenty. In a few weeks more,\" she continued,\r\n\"we are going to have the pleasure of showing you over our little land\r\nand explaining everything you care to know about. We want you to see our\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I assure you,\" Somel added, \"that our people want to see you.\"\r\n\r\nTerry brightened up immensely at this news, and reconciled himself to\r\nthe renewed demands upon our capacity as teachers. It was lucky that we\r\nknew so little, really, and had no books to refer to, else, I fancy we\r\nmight all be there yet, teaching those eager-minded women about the rest\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nAs to geography, they had the tradition of the Great Sea, beyond the\r\nmountains; and they could see for themselves the endless thick-forested\r\nplains below them--that was all. But from the few records of their\r\nancient condition--not \"before the flood\" with them, but before that\r\nmighty quake which had cut them off so completely--they were aware that\r\nthere were other peoples and other countries.\r\n\r\nIn geology they were quite ignorant.\r\n\r\nAs to anthropology, they had those same remnants of information about\r\nother peoples, and the knowledge of the savagery of the occupants of\r\nthose dim forests below. Nevertheless, they had inferred (marvelously\r\nkeen on inference and deduction their minds were!) the existence and\r\ndevelopment of civilization in other places, much as we infer it on\r\nother planets.\r\n\r\nWhen our biplane came whirring over their heads in that first scouting\r\nflight of ours, they had instantly accepted it as proof of the high\r\ndevelopment of Some Where Else, and had prepared to receive us as\r\ncautiously and eagerly as we might prepare to welcome visitors who came\r\n\"by meteor\" from Mars.\r\n\r\nOf history--outside their own--they knew nothing, of course, save for\r\ntheir ancient traditions.\r\n\r\nOf astronomy they had a fair working knowledge--that is a very old\r\nscience; and with it, a surprising range and facility in mathematics.\r\n\r\nPhysiology they were quite familiar with. Indeed, when it came to the\r\nsimpler and more concrete sciences, wherein the subject matter was at\r\nhand and they had but to exercise their minds upon it, the results were\r\nsurprising. They had worked out a chemistry, a botany, a physics,\r\nwith all the blends where a science touches an art, or merges into\r\nan industry, to such fullness of knowledge as made us feel like\r\nschoolchildren.\r\n\r\nAlso we found this out--as soon as we were free of the country, and\r\nby further study and question--that what one knew, all knew, to a very\r\nconsiderable extent.\r\n\r\nI talked later with little mountain girls from the fir-dark valleys\r\naway up at their highest part, and with sunburned plains-women and agile\r\nforesters, all over the country, as well as those in the towns, and\r\neverywhere there was the same high level of intelligence. Some knew far\r\nmore than others about one thing--they were specialized, of course; but\r\nall of them knew more about everything--that is, about everything the\r\ncountry was acquainted with--than is the case with us.\r\n\r\nWe boast a good deal of our \"high level of general intelligence\" and our\r\n\"compulsory public education,\" but in proportion to their opportunities\r\nthey were far better educated than our people.\r\n\r\nWith what we told them, from what sketches and models we were able to\r\nprepare, they constructed a sort of working outline to fill in as they\r\nlearned more.\r\n\r\nA big globe was made, and our uncertain maps, helped out by those in\r\nthat precious yearbook thing I had, were tentatively indicated upon it.\r\n\r\nThey sat in eager groups, masses of them who came for the purpose, and\r\nlistened while Jeff roughly ran over the geologic history of the earth,\r\nand showed them their own land in relation to the others. Out of that\r\nsame pocket reference book of mine came facts and figures which were\r\nseized upon and placed in right relation with unerring acumen.\r\n\r\nEven Terry grew interested in this work. \"If we can keep this up,\r\nthey'll be having us lecture to all the girls' schools and colleges--how\r\nabout that?\" he suggested to us. \"Don't know as I'd object to being an\r\nAuthority to such audiences.\"\r\n\r\nThey did, in fact, urge us to give public lectures later, but not to the\r\nhearers or with the purpose we expected.\r\n\r\nWhat they were doing with us was like--like--well, say like Napoleon\r\nextracting military information from a few illiterate peasants. They\r\nknew just what to ask, and just what use to make of it; they had\r\nmechanical appliances for disseminating information almost equal to ours\r\nat home; and by the time we were led forth to lecture, our audiences\r\nhad thoroughly mastered a well-arranged digest of all we had previously\r\ngiven to our teachers, and were prepared with such notes and questions\r\nas might have intimidated a university professor.\r\n\r\nThey were not audiences of girls, either. It was some time before we\r\nwere allowed to meet the young women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Do you mind telling what you intend to do with us?\" Terry burst\r\nforth one day, facing the calm and friendly Moadine with that funny\r\nhalf-blustering air of his. At first he used to storm and flourish quite\r\na good deal, but nothing seemed to amuse them more; they would gather\r\naround and watch him as if it was an exhibition, politely, but with\r\nevident interest. So he learned to check himself, and was almost\r\nreasonable in his bearing--but not quite.\r\n\r\nShe announced smoothly and evenly: \"Not in the least. I thought it was\r\nquite plain. We are trying to learn of you all we can, and to teach you\r\nwhat you are willing to learn of our country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\" he insisted.\r\n\r\nShe smiled a quiet enigmatic smile. \"That depends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Depends on what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mainly on yourselves,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you keep us shut up so closely?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because we do not feel quite safe in allowing you at large where there\r\nare so many young women.\"\r\n\r\nTerry was really pleased at that. He had thought as much, inwardly; but\r\nhe pushed the question. \"Why should you be afraid? We are gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled that little smile again, and asked: \"Are 'gentlemen' always\r\nsafe?\"\r\n\r\n\"You surely do not think that any of us,\" he said it with a good deal of\r\nemphasis on the \"us,\" \"would hurt your young girls?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no,\" she said quickly, in real surprise. \"The danger is quite the\r\nother way. They might hurt you. If, by any accident, you did harm any\r\none of us, you would have to face a million mothers.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked so amazed and outraged that Jeff and I laughed outright, but\r\nshe went on gently.\r\n\r\n\"I do not think you quite understand yet. You are but men, three men,\r\nin a country where the whole population are mothers--or are going to be.\r\nMotherhood means to us something which I cannot yet discover in any\r\nof the countries of which you tell us. You have spoken\"--she turned to\r\nJeff, \"of Human Brotherhood as a great idea among you, but even that I\r\njudge is far from a practical expression?\"\r\n\r\nJeff nodded rather sadly. \"Very far--\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Here we have Human Motherhood--in full working use,\" she went on.\r\n\"Nothing else except the literal sisterhood of our origin, and the far\r\nhigher and deeper union of our social growth.\r\n\r\n\"The children in this country are the one center and focus of all our\r\nthoughts. Every step of our advance is always considered in its effect\r\non them--on the race. You see, we are MOTHERS,\" she repeated, as if in\r\nthat she had said it all.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how that fact--which is shared by all women--constitutes\r\nany risk to us,\" Terry persisted. \"You mean they would defend their\r\nchildren from attack. Of course. Any mothers would. But we are not\r\nsavages, my dear lady; we are not going to hurt any mother's child.\"\r\n\r\nThey looked at one another and shook their heads a little, but\r\nZava turned to Jeff and urged him to make us see--said he seemed to\r\nunderstand more fully than we did. And he tried.\r\n\r\nI can see it now, or at least much more of it, but it has taken me a\r\nlong time, and a good deal of honest intellectual effort.\r\n\r\nWhat they call Motherhood was like this:\r\n\r\nThey began with a really high degree of social development, something\r\nlike that of Ancient Egypt or Greece. Then they suffered the loss of\r\neverything masculine, and supposed at first that all human power and\r\nsafety had gone too. Then they developed this virgin birth capacity.\r\nThen, since the prosperity of their children depended on it, the fullest\r\nand subtlest coordination began to be practiced.\r\n\r\nI remember how long Terry balked at the evident unanimity of these\r\nwomen--the most conspicuous feature of their whole culture. \"It's\r\nimpossible!\" he would insist. \"Women cannot cooperate--it's against\r\nnature.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we urged the obvious facts he would say: \"Fiddlesticks!\" or \"Hang\r\nyour facts--I tell you it can't be done!\" And we never succeeded in\r\nshutting him up till Jeff dragged in the hymenoptera.\r\n\r\n\"'Go to the ant, thou sluggard'--and learn something,\" he said\r\ntriumphantly. \"Don't they cooperate pretty well? You can't beat it. This\r\nplace is just like an enormous anthill--you know an anthill is nothing\r\nbut a nursery. And how about bees? Don't they manage to cooperate and\r\nlove one another? as that precious Constable had it. Just show me a\r\ncombination of male creatures, bird, bug, or beast, that works as well,\r\nwill you? Or one of our masculine countries where the people work\r\ntogether as well as they do here! I tell you, women are the natural\r\ncooperators, not men!\"\r\n\r\nTerry had to learn a good many things he did not want to. To go back to\r\nmy little analysis of what happened:\r\n\r\nThey developed all this close inter-service in the interests of their\r\nchildren. To do the best work they had to specialize, of course; the\r\nchildren needed spinners and weavers, farmers and gardeners, carpenters\r\nand masons, as well as mothers.\r\n\r\nThen came the filling up of the place. When a population multiplies\r\nby five every thirty years it soon reaches the limits of a country,\r\nespecially a small one like this. They very soon eliminated all the\r\ngrazing cattle--sheep were the last to go, I believe. Also, they worked\r\nout a system of intensive agriculture surpassing anything I ever heard\r\nof, with the very forests all reset with fruit- or nut-bearing trees.\r\n\r\nDo what they would, however, there soon came a time when they were\r\nconfronted with the problem of \"the pressure of population\" in an acute\r\nform. There was really crowding, and with it, unavoidably, a decline in\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\nAnd how did those women meet it?\r\n\r\nNot by a \"struggle for existence\" which would result in an everlasting\r\nwrithing mass of underbred people trying to get ahead of one\r\nanother--some few on top, temporarily, many constantly crushed out\r\nunderneath, a hopeless substratum of paupers and degenerates, and no\r\nserenity or peace for anyone, no possibility for really noble qualities\r\namong the people at large.\r\n\r\nNeither did they start off on predatory excursions to get more land from\r\nsomebody else, or to get more food from somebody else, to maintain their\r\nstruggling mass.\r\n\r\nNot at all. They sat down in council together and thought it out. Very\r\nclear, strong thinkers they were. They said: \"With our best endeavors\r\nthis country will support about so many people, with the standard of\r\npeace, comfort, health, beauty, and progress we demand. Very well. That\r\nis all the people we will make.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere you have it. You see, they were Mothers, not in our sense of\r\nhelpless involuntary fecundity, forced to fill and overfill the land,\r\nevery land, and then see their children suffer, sin, and die, fighting\r\nhorribly with one another; but in the sense of Conscious Makers\r\nof People. Mother-love with them was not a brute passion, a mere\r\n\"instinct,\" a wholly personal feeling; it was--a religion.\r\n\r\nIt included that limitless feeling of sisterhood, that wide unity in\r\nservice, which was so difficult for us to grasp. And it was National,\r\nRacial, Human--oh, I don't know how to say it.\r\n\r\nWe are used to seeing what we call \"a mother\" completely wrapped up in\r\nher own pink bundle of fascinating babyhood, and taking but the faintest\r\ntheoretic interest in anybody else's bundle, to say nothing of the\r\ncommon needs of ALL the bundles. But these women were working all\r\ntogether at the grandest of tasks--they were Making People--and they\r\nmade them well.\r\n\r\nThere followed a period of \"negative eugenics\" which must have been an\r\nappalling sacrifice. We are commonly willing to \"lay down our lives\" for\r\nour country, but they had to forego motherhood for their country--and it\r\nwas precisely the hardest thing for them to do.\r\n\r\nWhen I got this far in my reading I went to Somel for more light. We\r\nwere as friendly by that time as I had ever been in my life with any\r\nwoman. A mighty comfortable soul she was, giving one the nice smooth\r\nmother-feeling a man likes in a woman, and yet giving also the clear\r\nintelligence and dependableness I used to assume to be masculine\r\nqualities. We had talked volumes already.\r\n\r\n\"See here,\" said I. \"Here was this dreadful period when they got far too\r\nthick, and decided to limit the population. We have a lot of talk about\r\nthat among us, but your position is so different that I'd like to know a\r\nlittle more about it.\r\n\r\n\"I understand that you make Motherhood the highest social service--a\r\nsacrament, really; that it is only undertaken once, by the majority of\r\nthe population; that those held unfit are not allowed even that; and\r\nthat to be encouraged to bear more than one child is the very highest\r\nreward and honor in the power of the state.\"\r\n\r\n(She interpolated here that the nearest approach to an aristocracy\r\nthey had was to come of a line of \"Over Mothers\"--those who had been so\r\nhonored.)\r\n\r\n\"But what I do not understand, naturally, is how you prevent it. I\r\ngathered that each woman had five. You have no tyrannical husbands to\r\nhold in check--and you surely do not destroy the unborn--\"\r\n\r\nThe look of ghastly horror she gave me I shall never forget. She started\r\nfrom her chair, pale, her eyes blazing.\r\n\r\n\"Destroy the unborn--!\" she said in a hard whisper. \"Do men do that in\r\nyour country?\"\r\n\r\n\"Men!\" I began to answer, rather hotly, and then saw the gulf before\r\nme. None of us wanted these women to think that OUR women, of whom we\r\nboasted so proudly, were in any way inferior to them. I am ashamed\r\nto say that I equivocated. I told her of certain criminal types of\r\nwomen--perverts, or crazy, who had been known to commit infanticide. I\r\ntold her, truly enough, that there was much in our land which was\r\nopen to criticism, but that I hated to dwell on our defects until they\r\nunderstood us and our conditions better.\r\n\r\nAnd, making a wide detour, I scrambled back to my question of how they\r\nlimited the population.\r\n\r\nAs for Somel, she seemed sorry, a little ashamed even, of her too\r\nclearly expressed amazement. As I look back now, knowing them better, I\r\nam more and more and more amazed as I appreciate the exquisite courtesy\r\nwith which they had received over and over again statements and\r\nadmissions on our part which must have revolted them to the soul.\r\n\r\nShe explained to me, with sweet seriousness, that as I had supposed, at\r\nfirst each woman bore five children; and that, in their eager desire\r\nto build up a nation, they had gone on in that way for a few centuries,\r\ntill they were confronted with the absolute need of a limit. This fact\r\nwas equally plain to all--all were equally interested.\r\n\r\nThey were now as anxious to check their wonderful power as they had\r\nbeen to develop it; and for some generations gave the matter their most\r\nearnest thought and study.\r\n\r\n\"We were living on rations before we worked it out,\" she said. \"But we\r\ndid work it out. You see, before a child comes to one of us there is a\r\nperiod of utter exaltation--the whole being is uplifted and filled with\r\na concentrated desire for that child. We learned to look forward to that\r\nperiod with the greatest caution. Often our young women, those to whom\r\nmotherhood had not yet come, would voluntarily defer it. When that deep\r\ninner demand for a child began to be felt she would deliberately engage\r\nin the most active work, physical and mental; and even more important,\r\nwould solace her longing by the direct care and service of the babies we\r\nalready had.\"\r\n\r\nShe paused. Her wise sweet face grew deeply, reverently tender.\r\n\r\n\"We soon grew to see that mother-love has more than one channel of\r\nexpression. I think the reason our children are so--so fully loved, by\r\nall of us, is that we never--any of us--have enough of our own.\"\r\n\r\nThis seemed to me infinitely pathetic, and I said so. \"We have much that\r\nis bitter and hard in our life at home,\" I told her, \"but this seems to\r\nme piteous beyond words--a whole nation of starving mothers!\"\r\n\r\nBut she smiled her deep contented smile, and said I quite misunderstood.\r\n\r\n\"We each go without a certain range of personal joy,\" she said, \"but\r\nremember--we each have a million children to love and serve--OUR\r\nchildren.\"\r\n\r\nIt was beyond me. To hear a lot of women talk about \"our children\"! But\r\nI suppose that is the way the ants and bees would talk--do talk, maybe.\r\n\r\nThat was what they did, anyhow.\r\n\r\nWhen a woman chose to be a mother, she allowed the child-longing to\r\ngrow within her till it worked its natural miracle. When she did not so\r\nchoose she put the whole thing out of her mind, and fed her heart with\r\nthe other babies.\r\n\r\nLet me see--with us, children--minors, that is--constitute about\r\nthree-fifths of the population; with them only about one-third, or\r\nless. And precious--! No sole heir to an empire's throne, no solitary\r\nmillionaire baby, no only child of middle-aged parents, could compare as\r\nan idol with these Herland children.\r\n\r\nBut before I start on that subject I must finish up that little analysis\r\nI was trying to make.\r\n\r\nThey did effectually and permanently limit the population in numbers, so\r\nthat the country furnished plenty for the fullest, richest life for all\r\nof them: plenty of everything, including room, air, solitude even.\r\n\r\nAnd then they set to work to improve that population in quality--since\r\nthey were restricted in quantity. This they had been at work on,\r\nuninterruptedly, for some fifteen hundred years. Do you wonder they were\r\nnice people?\r\n\r\nPhysiology, hygiene, sanitation, physical culture--all that line of work\r\nhad been perfected long since. Sickness was almost wholly unknown among\r\nthem, so much so that a previously high development in what we call the\r\n\"science of medicine\" had become practically a lost art. They were a\r\nclean-bred, vigorous lot, having the best of care, the most perfect\r\nliving conditions always.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to psychology--there was no one thing which left us so\r\ndumbfounded, so really awed, as the everyday working knowledge--and\r\npractice--they had in this line. As we learned more and more of it, we\r\nlearned to appreciate the exquisite mastery with which we ourselves,\r\nstrangers of alien race, of unknown opposite sex, had been understood\r\nand provided for from the first.\r\n\r\nWith this wide, deep, thorough knowledge, they had met and solved the\r\nproblems of education in ways some of which I hope to make clear later.\r\nThose nation-loved children of theirs compared with the average in our\r\ncountry as the most perfectly cultivated, richly developed roses compare\r\nwith--tumbleweeds. Yet they did not SEEM \"cultivated\" at all--it had all\r\nbecome a natural condition.\r\n\r\nAnd this people, steadily developing in mental capacity, in will power,\r\nin social devotion, had been playing with the arts and sciences--as\r\nfar as they knew them--for a good many centuries now with inevitable\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nInto this quiet lovely land, among these wise, sweet, strong women, we,\r\nin our easy assumption of superiority, had suddenly arrived; and now,\r\ntamed and trained to a degree they considered safe, we were at last\r\nbrought out to see the country, to know the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. Our Growing Modesty\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing at last considered sufficiently tamed and trained to be trusted\r\nwith scissors, we barbered ourselves as best we could. A close-trimmed\r\nbeard is certainly more comfortable than a full one. Razors, naturally,\r\nthey could not supply.\r\n\r\n\"With so many old women you'd think there'd be some razors,\" sneered\r\nTerry. Whereat Jeff pointed out that he never before had seen such\r\ncomplete absence of facial hair on women.\r\n\r\n\"Looks to me as if the absence of men made them more feminine in that\r\nregard, anyhow,\" he suggested.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's the only one then,\" Terry reluctantly agreed. \"A less\r\nfeminine lot I never saw. A child apiece doesn't seem to be enough to\r\ndevelop what I call motherliness.\"\r\n\r\nTerry's idea of motherliness was the usual one, involving a baby in\r\narms, or \"a little flock about her knees,\" and the complete absorption\r\nof the mother in said baby or flock. A motherliness which dominated\r\nsociety, which influenced every art and industry, which absolutely\r\nprotected all childhood, and gave to it the most perfect care and\r\ntraining, did not seem motherly--to Terry.\r\n\r\nWe had become well used to the clothes. They were quite as comfortable\r\nas our own--in some ways more so--and undeniably better looking. As to\r\npockets, they left nothing to be desired. That second garment was fairly\r\nquilted with pockets. They were most ingeniously arranged, so as to be\r\nconvenient to the hand and not inconvenient to the body, and were so\r\nplaced as at once to strengthen the garment and add decorative lines of\r\nstitching.\r\n\r\nIn this, as in so many other points we had now to observe, there was\r\nshown the action of a practical intelligence, coupled with fine artistic\r\nfeeling, and, apparently, untrammeled by any injurious influences.\r\n\r\nOur first step of comparative freedom was a personally conducted tour of\r\nthe country. No pentagonal bodyguard now! Only our special tutors,\r\nand we got on famously with them. Jeff said he loved Zava like an\r\naunt--\"only jollier than any aunt I ever saw\"; Somel and I were as\r\nchummy as could be--the best of friends; but it was funny to watch Terry\r\nand Moadine. She was patient with him, and courteous, but it was like\r\nthe patience and courtesy of some great man, say a skilled, experienced\r\ndiplomat, with a schoolgirl. Her grave acquiescence with his most\r\npreposterous expression of feeling; her genial laughter, not only\r\nwith, but, I often felt, at him--though impeccably polite; her\r\ninnocent questions, which almost invariably led him to say more than he\r\nintended--Jeff and I found it all amusing to watch.\r\n\r\nHe never seemed to recognize that quiet background of superiority. When\r\nshe dropped an argument he always thought he had silenced her; when she\r\nlaughed he thought it tribute to his wit.\r\n\r\nI hated to admit to myself how much Terry had sunk in my esteem. Jeff\r\nfelt it too, I am sure; but neither of us admitted it to the other.\r\nAt home we had measured him with other men, and, though we knew his\r\nfailings, he was by no means an unusual type. We knew his virtues too,\r\nand they had always seemed more prominent than the faults. Measured\r\namong women--our women at home, I mean--he had always stood high. He\r\nwas visibly popular. Even where his habits were known, there was no\r\ndiscrimination against him; in some cases his reputation for what was\r\nfelicitously termed \"gaiety\" seemed a special charm.\r\n\r\nBut here, against the calm wisdom and quiet restrained humor of these\r\nwomen, with only that blessed Jeff and my inconspicuous self to compare\r\nwith, Terry did stand out rather strong.\r\n\r\nAs \"a man among men,\" he didn't; as a man among--I shall have to say,\r\n\"females,\" he didn't; his intense masculinity seemed only fit complement\r\nto their intense femininity. But here he was all out of drawing.\r\n\r\nMoadine was a big woman, with a balanced strength that seldom showed.\r\nHer eye was as quietly watchful as a fencer's. She maintained a pleasant\r\nrelation with her charge, but I doubt if many, even in that country,\r\ncould have done as well.\r\n\r\nHe called her \"Maud,\" amongst ourselves, and said she was \"a good old\r\nsoul, but a little slow\"; wherein he was quite wrong. Needless to\r\nsay, he called Jeff's teacher \"Java,\" and sometimes \"Mocha,\" or plain\r\n\"Coffee\"; when specially mischievous, \"Chicory,\" and even \"Postum.\" But\r\nSomel rather escaped this form of humor, save for a rather forced \"Some\r\n'ell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you people have but one name?\" he asked one day, after we\r\nhad been introduced to a whole group of them, all with pleasant,\r\nfew-syllabled strange names, like the ones we knew.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" Moadine told him. \"A good many of us have another, as we get\r\non in life--a descriptive one. That is the name we earn. Sometimes even\r\nthat is changed, or added to, in an unusually rich life. Such as our\r\npresent Land Mother--what you call president or king, I believe. She\r\nwas called Mera, even as a child; that means 'thinker.' Later there\r\nwas added Du--Du-Mera--the wise thinker, and now we all know her as\r\nO-du-mera--great and wise thinker. You shall meet her.\"\r\n\r\n\"No surnames at all then?\" pursued Terry, with his somewhat patronizing\r\nair. \"No family name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why no,\" she said. \"Why should we? We are all descended from a common\r\nsource--all one 'family' in reality. You see, our comparatively brief\r\nand limited history gives us that advantage at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"But does not each mother want her own child to bear her name?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"No--why should she? The child has its own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why for--for identification--so people will know whose child she is.\"\r\n\r\n\"We keep the most careful records,\" said Somel. \"Each one of us has our\r\nexact line of descent all the way back to our dear First Mother. There\r\nare many reasons for doing that. But as to everyone knowing which child\r\nbelongs to which mother--why should she?\"\r\n\r\nHere, as in so many other instances, we were led to feel the difference\r\nbetween the purely maternal and the paternal attitude of mind. The\r\nelement of personal pride seemed strangely lacking.\r\n\r\n\"How about your other works?\" asked Jeff. \"Don't you sign your names to\r\nthem--books and statues and so on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, surely, we are all glad and proud to. Not only books and statues,\r\nbut all kinds of work. You will find little names on the houses, on the\r\nfurniture, on the dishes sometimes. Because otherwise one is likely to\r\nforget, and we want to know to whom to be grateful.\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak as if it were done for the convenience of the consumer--not\r\nthe pride of the producer,\" I suggested.\r\n\r\n\"It's both,\" said Somel. \"We have pride enough in our work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why not in your children?\" urged Jeff.\r\n\r\n\"But we have! We're magnificently proud of them,\" she insisted.\r\n\r\n\"Then why not sign 'em?\" said Terry triumphantly.\r\n\r\nMoadine turned to him with her slightly quizzical smile. \"Because the\r\nfinished product is not a private one. When they are babies, we do speak\r\nof them, at times, as 'Essa's Lato,' or 'Novine's Amel'; but that is\r\nmerely descriptive and conversational. In the records, of course,\r\nthe child stands in her own line of mothers; but in dealing with it\r\npersonally it is Lato, or Amel, without dragging in its ancestors.\"\r\n\r\n\"But have you names enough to give a new one to each child?\"\r\n\r\n\"Assuredly we have, for each living generation.\"\r\n\r\nThen they asked about our methods, and found first that \"we\" did so and\r\nso, and then that other nations did differently. Upon which they wanted\r\nto know which method has been proved best--and we had to admit that\r\nso far as we knew there had been no attempt at comparison, each people\r\npursuing its own custom in the fond conviction of superiority, and\r\neither despising or quite ignoring the others.\r\n\r\nWith these women the most salient quality in all their institutions was\r\nreasonableness. When I dug into the records to follow out any line of\r\ndevelopment, that was the most astonishing thing--the conscious effort\r\nto make it better.\r\n\r\nThey had early observed the value of certain improvements, had easily\r\ninferred that there was room for more, and took the greatest pains to\r\ndevelop two kinds of minds--the critic and inventor. Those who showed\r\nan early tendency to observe, to discriminate, to suggest, were given\r\nspecial training for that function; and some of their highest officials\r\nspent their time in the most careful study of one or another branch of\r\nwork, with a view to its further improvement.\r\n\r\nIn each generation there was sure to arrive some new mind to detect\r\nfaults and show need of alterations; and the whole corps of inventors\r\nwas at hand to apply their special faculty at the point criticized, and\r\noffer suggestions.\r\n\r\nWe had learned by this time not to open a discussion on any of their\r\ncharacteristics without first priming ourselves to answer questions\r\nabout our own methods; so I kept rather quiet on this matter of\r\nconscious improvement. We were not prepared to show our way was better.\r\n\r\nThere was growing in our minds, at least in Jeff's and mine, a\r\nkeen appreciation of the advantages of this strange country and its\r\nmanagement. Terry remained critical. We laid most of it to his nerves.\r\nHe certainly was irritable.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous feature of the whole land was the perfection of\r\nits food supply. We had begun to notice from that very first walk in the\r\nforest, the first partial view from our 'plane. Now we were taken to see\r\nthis mighty garden, and shown its methods of culture.\r\n\r\nThe country was about the size of Holland, some ten or twelve\r\nthousand square miles. One could lose a good many Hollands along the\r\nforest-smothered flanks of those mighty mountains. They had a population\r\nof about three million--not a large one, but quality is something. Three\r\nmillion is quite enough to allow for considerable variation, and these\r\npeople varied more widely than we could at first account for.\r\n\r\nTerry had insisted that if they were parthenogenetic they'd be as alike\r\nas so many ants or aphids; he urged their visible differences as proof\r\nthat there must be men--somewhere.\r\n\r\nBut when we asked them, in our later, more intimate conversations, how\r\nthey accounted for so much divergence without cross-fertilization,\r\nthey attributed it partly to the careful education, which followed each\r\nslight tendency to differ, and partly to the law of mutation. This they\r\nhad found in their work with plants, and fully proven in their own case.\r\n\r\nPhysically they were more alike than we, as they lacked all morbid or\r\nexcessive types. They were tall, strong, healthy, and beautiful as a\r\nrace, but differed individually in a wide range of feature, coloring,\r\nand expression.\r\n\r\n\"But surely the most important growth is in mind--and in the things we\r\nmake,\" urged Somel. \"Do you find your physical variation accompanied by\r\na proportionate variation in ideas, feelings, and products? Or, among\r\npeople who look more alike, do you find their internal life and their\r\nwork as similar?\"\r\n\r\nWe were rather doubtful on this point, and inclined to hold that there\r\nwas more chance of improvement in greater physical variation.\r\n\r\n\"It certainly should be,\" Zava admitted. \"We have always thought it a\r\ngrave initial misfortune to have lost half our little world. Perhaps\r\nthat is one reason why we have so striven for conscious improvement.\"\r\n\r\n\"But acquired traits are not transmissible,\" Terry declared. \"Weissman\r\nhas proved that.\"\r\n\r\nThey never disputed our absolute statements, only made notes of them.\r\n\r\n\"If that is so, then our improvement must be due either to mutation, or\r\nsolely to education,\" she gravely pursued. \"We certainly have improved.\r\nIt may be that all these higher qualities were latent in the original\r\nmother, that careful education is bringing them out, and that our\r\npersonal differences depend on slight variations in prenatal condition.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it is more in your accumulated culture,\" Jeff suggested. \"And\r\nin the amazing psychic growth you have made. We know very little about\r\nmethods of real soul culture--and you seem to know a great deal.\"\r\n\r\nBe that as it might, they certainly presented a higher level of active\r\nintelligence, and of behavior, than we had so far really grasped. Having\r\nknown in our lives several people who showed the same delicate courtesy\r\nand were equally pleasant to live with, at least when they wore their\r\n\"company manners,\" we had assumed that our companions were a carefully\r\nchosen few. Later we were more and more impressed that all this gentle\r\nbreeding was breeding; that they were born to it, reared in it, that it\r\nwas as natural and universal with them as the gentleness of doves or the\r\nalleged wisdom of serpents.\r\n\r\nAs for the intelligence, I confess that this was the most impressive\r\nand, to me, most mortifying, of any single feature of Herland. We soon\r\nceased to comment on this or other matters which to them were such\r\nobvious commonplaces as to call forth embarrassing questions about our\r\nown conditions.\r\n\r\nThis was nowhere better shown than in that matter of food supply, which\r\nI will now attempt to describe.\r\n\r\nHaving improved their agriculture to the highest point, and carefully\r\nestimated the number of persons who could comfortably live on their\r\nsquare miles; having then limited their population to that number, one\r\nwould think that was all there was to be done. But they had not thought\r\nso. To them the country was a unit--it was theirs. They themselves were\r\na unit, a conscious group; they thought in terms of the community. As\r\nsuch, their time-sense was not limited to the hopes and ambitions of an\r\nindividual life. Therefore, they habitually considered and carried out\r\nplans for improvement which might cover centuries.\r\n\r\nI had never seen, had scarcely imagined, human beings undertaking such\r\na work as the deliberate replanting of an entire forest area with\r\ndifferent kinds of trees. Yet this seemed to them the simplest common\r\nsense, like a man's plowing up an inferior lawn and reseeding it. Now\r\nevery tree bore fruit--edible fruit, that is. In the case of one\r\ntree, in which they took especial pride, it had originally no fruit at\r\nall--that is, none humanly edible--yet was so beautiful that they wished\r\nto keep it. For nine hundred years they had experimented, and now\r\nshowed us this particularly lovely graceful tree, with a profuse crop of\r\nnutritious seeds.\r\n\r\nThey had early decided that trees were the best food plants, requiring\r\nfar less labor in tilling the soil, and bearing a larger amount of food\r\nfor the same ground space; also doing much to preserve and enrich the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nDue regard had been paid to seasonable crops, and their fruit and nuts,\r\ngrains and berries, kept on almost the year through.\r\n\r\nOn the higher part of the country, near the backing wall of mountains,\r\nthey had a real winter with snow. Toward the south-eastern point, where\r\nthere was a large valley with a lake whose outlet was subterranean, the\r\nclimate was like that of California, and citrus fruits, figs, and olives\r\ngrew abundantly.\r\n\r\nWhat impressed me particularly was their scheme of fertilization. Here\r\nwas this little shut-in piece of land where one would have thought an\r\nordinary people would have been starved out long ago or reduced to an\r\nannual struggle for life. These careful culturists had worked out a\r\nperfect scheme of refeeding the soil with all that came out of it. All\r\nthe scraps and leavings of their food, plant waste from lumber work or\r\ntextile industry, all the solid matter from the sewage, properly treated\r\nand combined--everything which came from the earth went back to it.\r\n\r\nThe practical result was like that in any healthy forest; an\r\nincreasingly valuable soil was being built, instead of the progressive\r\nimpoverishment so often seen in the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nWhen this first burst upon us we made such approving comments that they\r\nwere surprised that such obvious common sense should be praised; asked\r\nwhat our methods were; and we had some difficulty in--well, in\r\ndiverting them, by referring to the extent of our own land, and\r\nthe--admitted--carelessness with which we had skimmed the cream of it.\r\n\r\nAt least we thought we had diverted them. Later I found that besides\r\nkeeping a careful and accurate account of all we told them, they had a\r\nsort of skeleton chart, on which the things we said and the things we\r\npalpably avoided saying were all set down and studied. It really was\r\nchild's play for those profound educators to work out a painfully\r\naccurate estimate of our conditions--in some lines. When a given line of\r\nobservation seemed to lead to some very dreadful inference they always\r\ngave us the benefit of the doubt, leaving it open to further knowledge.\r\nSome of the things we had grown to accept as perfectly natural, or\r\nas belonging to our human limitations, they literally could not have\r\nbelieved; and, as I have said, we had all of us joined in a tacit\r\nendeavor to conceal much of the social status at home.\r\n\r\n\"Confound their grandmotherly minds!\" Terry said. \"Of course they can't\r\nunderstand a Man's World! They aren't human--they're just a pack of\r\nFe-Fe-Females!\" This was after he had to admit their parthenogenesis.\r\n\r\n\"I wish our grandfatherly minds had managed as well,\" said Jeff. \"Do you\r\nreally think it's to our credit that we have muddled along with all our\r\npoverty and disease and the like? They have peace and plenty, wealth and\r\nbeauty, goodness and intellect. Pretty good people, I think!\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll find they have their faults too,\" Terry insisted; and partly in\r\nself-defense, we all three began to look for those faults of theirs.\r\nWe had been very strong on this subject before we got there--in those\r\nbaseless speculations of ours.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose there is a country of women only,\" Jeff had put it, over and\r\nover. \"What'll they be like?\"\r\n\r\nAnd we had been cocksure as to the inevitable limitations, the faults\r\nand vices, of a lot of women. We had expected them to be given over to\r\nwhat we called \"feminine vanity\"--\"frills and furbelows,\" and we found\r\nthey had evolved a costume more perfect than the Chinese dress, richly\r\nbeautiful when so desired, always useful, of unfailing dignity and good\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nWe had expected a dull submissive monotony, and found a daring social\r\ninventiveness far beyond our own, and a mechanical and scientific\r\ndevelopment fully equal to ours.\r\n\r\nWe had expected pettiness, and found a social consciousness besides\r\nwhich our nations looked like quarreling children--feebleminded ones at\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nWe had expected jealousy, and found a broad sisterly affection, a\r\nfair-minded intelligence, to which we could produce no parallel.\r\n\r\nWe had expected hysteria, and found a standard of health and vigor, a\r\ncalmness of temper, to which the habit of profanity, for instance, was\r\nimpossible to explain--we tried it.\r\n\r\nAll these things even Terry had to admit, but he still insisted that we\r\nshould find out the other side pretty soon.\r\n\r\n\"It stands to reason, doesn't it?\" he argued. \"The whole thing's deuced\r\nunnatural--I'd say impossible if we weren't in it. And an unnatural\r\ncondition's sure to have unnatural results. You'll find some awful\r\ncharacteristics--see if you don't! For instance--we don't know yet what\r\nthey do with their criminals--their defectives--their aged. You notice\r\nwe haven't seen any! There's got to be something!\"\r\n\r\nI was inclined to believe that there had to be something, so I took the\r\nbull by the horns--the cow, I should say!--and asked Somel.\r\n\r\n\"I want to find some flaw in all this perfection,\" I told her flatly.\r\n\"It simply isn't possible that three million people have no faults. We\r\nare trying our best to understand and learn--would you mind helping us\r\nby saying what, to your minds, are the worst qualities of this unique\r\ncivilization of yours?\"\r\n\r\nWe were sitting together in a shaded arbor, in one of those\r\neating-gardens of theirs. The delicious food had been eaten, a plate of\r\nfruit still before us. We could look out on one side over a stretch of\r\nopen country, quietly rich and lovely; on the other, the garden, with\r\ntables here and there, far apart enough for privacy. Let me say right\r\nhere that with all their careful \"balance of population\" there was no\r\ncrowding in this country. There was room, space, a sunny breezy freedom\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nSomel set her chin upon her hand, her elbow on the low wall beside her,\r\nand looked off over the fair land.\r\n\r\n\"Of course we have faults--all of us,\" she said. \"In one way you\r\nmight say that we have more than we used to--that is, our standard\r\nof perfection seems to get farther and farther away. But we are not\r\ndiscouraged, because our records do show gain--considerable gain.\r\n\r\n\"When we began--even with the start of one particularly noble mother--we\r\ninherited the characteristics of a long race-record behind her. And they\r\ncropped out from time to time--alarmingly. But it is--yes, quite six\r\nhundred years since we have had what you call a 'criminal.'\r\n\r\n\"We have, of course, made it our first business to train out, to breed\r\nout, when possible, the lowest types.\"\r\n\r\n\"Breed out?\" I asked. \"How could you--with parthenogenesis?\"\r\n\r\n\"If the girl showing the bad qualities had still the power to appreciate\r\nsocial duty, we appealed to her, by that, to renounce motherhood. Some\r\nof the few worst types were, fortunately, unable to reproduce. But if\r\nthe fault was in a disproportionate egotism--then the girl was sure\r\nshe had the right to have children, even that hers would be better than\r\nothers.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can see that,\" I said. \"And then she would be likely to rear them in\r\nthe same spirit.\"\r\n\r\n\"That we never allowed,\" answered Somel quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Allowed?\" I queried. \"Allowed a mother to rear her own children?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not,\" said Somel, \"unless she was fit for that supreme task.\"\r\n\r\nThis was rather a blow to my previous convictions.\r\n\r\n\"But I thought motherhood was for each of you--\"\r\n\r\n\"Motherhood--yes, that is, maternity, to bear a child. But education is\r\nour highest art, only allowed to our highest artists.\"\r\n\r\n\"Education?\" I was puzzled again. \"I don't mean education. I mean by\r\nmotherhood not only child-bearing, but the care of babies.\"\r\n\r\n\"The care of babies involves education, and is entrusted only to the\r\nmost fit,\" she repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Then you separate mother and child!\" I cried in cold horror, something\r\nof Terry's feeling creeping over me, that there must be something wrong\r\namong these many virtues.\r\n\r\n\"Not usually,\" she patiently explained. \"You see, almost every woman\r\nvalues her maternity above everything else. Each girl holds it close\r\nand dear, an exquisite joy, a crowning honor, the most intimate, most\r\npersonal, most precious thing. That is, the child-rearing has come to\r\nbe with us a culture so profoundly studied, practiced with such subtlety\r\nand skill, that the more we love our children the less we are willing to\r\ntrust that process to unskilled hands--even our own.\"\r\n\r\n\"But a mother's love--\" I ventured.\r\n\r\nShe studied my face, trying to work out a means of clear explanation.\r\n\r\n\"You told us about your dentists,\" she said, at length, \"those quaintly\r\nspecialized persons who spend their lives filling little holes in other\r\npersons' teeth--even in children's teeth sometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" I said, not getting her drift.\r\n\r\n\"Does mother-love urge mothers--with you--to fill their own children's\r\nteeth? Or to wish to?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why no--of course not,\" I protested. \"But that is a highly specialized\r\ncraft. Surely the care of babies is open to any woman--any mother!\"\r\n\r\n\"We do not think so,\" she gently replied. \"Those of us who are the\r\nmost highly competent fulfill that office; and a majority of our girls\r\neagerly try for it--I assure you we have the very best.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the poor mother--bereaved of her baby--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no!\" she earnestly assured me. \"Not in the least bereaved. It is her\r\nbaby still--it is with her--she has not lost it. But she is not the only\r\none to care for it. There are others whom she knows to be wiser. She\r\nknows it because she has studied as they did, practiced as they did, and\r\nhonors their real superiority. For the child's sake, she is glad to have\r\nfor it this highest care.\"\r\n\r\nI was unconvinced. Besides, this was only hearsay; I had yet to see the\r\nmotherhood of Herland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. The Girls of Herland\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last Terry's ambition was realized. We were invited, always\r\ncourteously and with free choice on our part, to address general\r\naudiences and classes of girls.\r\n\r\nI remember the first time--and how careful we were about our clothes,\r\nand our amateur barbering. Terry, in particular, was fussy to a degree\r\nabout the cut of his beard, and so critical of our combined efforts,\r\nthat we handed him the shears and told him to please himself. We\r\nbegan to rather prize those beards of ours; they were almost our sole\r\ndistinction among those tall and sturdy women, with their cropped hair\r\nand sexless costume. Being offered a wide selection of garments, we had\r\nchosen according to our personal taste, and were surprised to find,\r\non meeting large audiences, that we were the most highly decorated,\r\nespecially Terry.\r\n\r\nHe was a very impressive figure, his strong features softened by the\r\nsomewhat longer hair--though he made me trim it as closely as I knew\r\nhow; and he wore his richly embroidered tunic with its broad, loose\r\ngirdle with quite a Henry V air. Jeff looked more like--well, like a\r\nHuguenot Lover; and I don't know what I looked like, only that I felt\r\nvery comfortable. When I got back to our own padded armor and its\r\nstarched borders I realized with acute regret how comfortable were those\r\nHerland clothes.\r\n\r\nWe scanned that audience, looking for the three bright faces we knew;\r\nbut they were not to be seen. Just a multitude of girls: quiet, eager,\r\nwatchful, all eyes and ears to listen and learn.\r\n\r\nWe had been urged to give, as fully as we cared to, a sort of synopsis\r\nof world history, in brief, and to answer questions.\r\n\r\n\"We are so utterly ignorant, you see,\" Moadine had explained to us. \"We\r\nknow nothing but such science as we have worked out for ourselves,\r\njust the brain work of one small half-country; and you, we gather, have\r\nhelped one another all over the globe, sharing your discoveries, pooling\r\nyour progress. How wonderful, how supremely beautiful your civilization\r\nmust be!\"\r\n\r\nSomel gave a further suggestion.\r\n\r\n\"You do not have to begin all over again, as you did with us. We have\r\nmade a sort of digest of what we have learned from you, and it has been\r\neagerly absorbed, all over the country. Perhaps you would like to see\r\nour outline?\"\r\n\r\nWe were eager to see it, and deeply impressed. To us, at first, these\r\nwomen, unavoidably ignorant of what to us was the basic commonplace of\r\nknowledge, had seemed on the plane of children, or of savages. What we\r\nhad been forced to admit, with growing acquaintance, was that they\r\nwere ignorant as Plato and Aristotle were, but with a highly developed\r\nmentality quite comparable to that of Ancient Greece.\r\n\r\nFar be it from me to lumber these pages with an account of what we so\r\nimperfectly strove to teach them. The memorable fact is what they taught\r\nus, or some faint glimpse of it. And at present, our major interest was\r\nnot at all in the subject matter of our talk, but in the audience.\r\n\r\nGirls--hundreds of them--eager, bright-eyed, attentive young faces;\r\ncrowding questions, and, I regret to say, an increasing inability on our\r\npart to answer them effectively.\r\n\r\nOur special guides, who were on the platform with us, and sometimes\r\naided in clarifying a question or, oftener, an answer, noticed this\r\neffect, and closed the formal lecture part of the evening rather\r\nshortly.\r\n\r\n\"Our young women will be glad to meet you,\" Somel suggested, \"to talk\r\nwith you more personally, if you are willing?\"\r\n\r\nWilling! We were impatient and said as much, at which I saw a flickering\r\nlittle smile cross Moadine's face. Even then, with all those eager young\r\nthings waiting to talk to us, a sudden question crossed my mind: \"What\r\nwas their point of view? What did they think of us?\" We learned that\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nTerry plunged in among those young creatures with a sort of rapture,\r\nsomewhat as a glad swimmer takes to the sea. Jeff, with a rapt look on\r\nhis high-bred face, approached as to a sacrament. But I was a little\r\nchilled by that last thought of mine, and kept my eyes open. I found\r\ntime to watch Jeff, even while I was surrounded by an eager group of\r\nquestioners--as we all were--and saw how his worshipping eyes, his grave\r\ncourtesy, pleased and drew some of them; while others, rather stronger\r\nspirits they looked to be, drew away from his group to Terry's or mine.\r\n\r\nI watched Terry with special interest, knowing how he had longed for\r\nthis time, and how irresistible he had always been at home. And I could\r\nsee, just in snatches, of course, how his suave and masterful approach\r\nseemed to irritate them; his too-intimate glances were vaguely resented,\r\nhis compliments puzzled and annoyed. Sometimes a girl would flush, not\r\nwith drooped eyelids and inviting timidity, but with anger and a quick\r\nlift of the head. Girl after girl turned on her heel and left him, till\r\nhe had but a small ring of questioners, and they, visibly, were the\r\nleast \"girlish\" of the lot.\r\n\r\nI saw him looking pleased at first, as if he thought he was making\r\na strong impression; but, finally, casting a look at Jeff, or me, he\r\nseemed less pleased--and less.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I was most agreeably surprised. At home I never\r\nwas \"popular.\" I had my girl friends, good ones, but they were\r\nfriends--nothing else. Also they were of somewhat the same clan, not\r\npopular in the sense of swarming admirers. But here, to my astonishment,\r\nI found my crowd was the largest.\r\n\r\nI have to generalize, of course, rather telescoping many impressions;\r\nbut the first evening was a good sample of the impression we made. Jeff\r\nhad a following, if I may call it that, of the more sentimental--though\r\nthat's not the word I want. The less practical, perhaps; the girls who\r\nwere artists of some sort, ethicists, teachers--that kind.\r\n\r\nTerry was reduced to a rather combative group: keen, logical, inquiring\r\nminds, not overly sensitive, the very kind he liked least; while, as for\r\nme--I became quite cocky over my general popularity.\r\n\r\nTerry was furious about it. We could hardly blame him.\r\n\r\n\"Girls!\" he burst forth, when that evening was over and we were by\r\nourselves once more. \"Call those GIRLS!\"\r\n\r\n\"Most delightful girls, I call them,\" said Jeff, his blue eyes dreamily\r\ncontented.\r\n\r\n\"What do YOU call them?\" I mildly inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Boys! Nothing but boys, most of 'em. A standoffish, disagreeable lot at\r\nthat. Critical, impertinent youngsters. No girls at all.\"\r\n\r\nHe was angry and severe, not a little jealous, too, I think. Afterward,\r\nwhen he found out just what it was they did not like, he changed his\r\nmanner somewhat and got on better. He had to. For, in spite of his\r\ncriticism, they were girls, and, furthermore, all the girls there\r\nwere! Always excepting our three!--with whom we presently renewed our\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to courtship, which it soon did, I can of course best\r\ndescribe my own--and am least inclined to. But of Jeff I heard somewhat;\r\nhe was inclined to dwell reverently and admiringly, at some length,\r\non the exalted sentiment and measureless perfection of his Celis; and\r\nTerry--Terry made so many false starts and met so many rebuffs, that by\r\nthe time he really settled down to win Alima, he was considerably wiser.\r\nAt that, it was not smooth sailing. They broke and quarreled, over and\r\nover; he would rush off to console himself with some other fair one--the\r\nother fair one would have none of him--and he would drift back to Alima,\r\nbecoming more and more devoted each time.\r\n\r\nShe never gave an inch. A big, handsome creature, rather exceptionally\r\nstrong even in that race of strong women, with a proud head and sweeping\r\nlevel brows that lined across above her dark eager eyes like the wide\r\nwings of a soaring hawk.\r\n\r\nI was good friends with all three of them but best of all with Ellador,\r\nlong before that feeling changed, for both of us.\r\n\r\nFrom her, and from Somel, who talked very freely with me, I learned at\r\nlast something of the viewpoint of Herland toward its visitors.\r\n\r\nHere they were, isolated, happy, contented, when the booming buzz of our\r\nbiplane tore the air above them.\r\n\r\nEverybody heard it--saw it--for miles and miles, word flashed all over\r\nthe country, and a council was held in every town and village.\r\n\r\nAnd this was their rapid determination:\r\n\r\n\"From another country. Probably men. Evidently highly civilized.\r\nDoubtless possessed of much valuable knowledge. May be dangerous. Catch\r\nthem if possible; tame and train them if necessary This may be a chance\r\nto re-establish a bi-sexual state for our people.\"\r\n\r\nThey were not afraid of us--three million highly intelligent women--or\r\ntwo million, counting only grown-ups--were not likely to be afraid of\r\nthree young men. We thought of them as \"Women,\" and therefore timid; but\r\nit was two thousand years since they had had anything to be afraid\r\nof, and certainly more than one thousand since they had outgrown the\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nWe thought--at least Terry did--that we could have our pick of them.\r\nThey thought--very cautiously and farsightedly--of picking us, if it\r\nseemed wise.\r\n\r\nAll that time we were in training they studied us, analyzed us, prepared\r\nreports about us, and this information was widely disseminated all about\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nNot a girl in that country had not been learning for months as much\r\nas could be gathered about our country, our culture, our personal\r\ncharacters. No wonder their questions were hard to answer. But I am\r\nsorry to say, when we were at last brought out and--exhibited (I hate to\r\ncall it that, but that's what it was), there was no rush of takers. Here\r\nwas poor old Terry fondly imagining that at last he was free to stray in\r\n\"a rosebud garden of girls\"--and behold! the rosebuds were all with keen\r\nappraising eye, studying us.\r\n\r\nThey were interested, profoundly interested, but it was not the kind of\r\ninterest we were looking for.\r\n\r\nTo get an idea of their attitude you have to hold in mind their\r\nextremely high sense of solidarity. They were not each choosing a\r\nlover; they hadn't the faintest idea of love--sex-love, that is. These\r\ngirls--to each of whom motherhood was a lodestar, and that motherhood\r\nexalted above a mere personal function, looked forward to as the highest\r\nsocial service, as the sacrament of a lifetime--were now confronted with\r\nan opportunity to make the great step of changing their whole status, of\r\nreverting to their earlier bi-sexual order of nature.\r\n\r\nBeside this underlying consideration there was the limitless interest\r\nand curiosity in our civilization, purely impersonal, and held by an\r\norder of mind beside which we were like--schoolboys.\r\n\r\nIt was small wonder that our lectures were not a success; and none at\r\nall that our, or at least Terry's, advances were so ill received. The\r\nreason for my own comparative success was at first far from pleasing to\r\nmy pride.\r\n\r\n\"We like you the best,\" Somel told me, \"because you seem more like us.\"\r\n\r\n\"More like a lot of women!\" I thought to myself disgustedly, and then\r\nremembered how little like \"women,\" in our derogatory sense, they were.\r\nShe was smiling at me, reading my thought.\r\n\r\n\"We can quite see that we do not seem like--women--to you. Of course,\r\nin a bi-sexual race the distinctive feature of each sex must be\r\nintensified. But surely there are characteristics enough which belong\r\nto People, aren't there? That's what I mean about you being more like\r\nus--more like People. We feel at ease with you.\"\r\n\r\nJeff's difficulty was his exalted gallantry. He idealized women, and\r\nwas always looking for a chance to \"protect\" or to \"serve\" them. These\r\nneeded neither protection nor service. They were living in peace and\r\npower and plenty; we were their guests, their prisoners, absolutely\r\ndependent.\r\n\r\nOf course we could promise whatsoever we might of advantages, if they\r\nwould come to our country; but the more we knew of theirs, the less we\r\nboasted.\r\n\r\nTerry's jewels and trinkets they prized as curios; handed them about,\r\nasking questions as to workmanship, not in the least as to value; and\r\ndiscussed not ownership, but which museum to put them in.\r\n\r\nWhen a man has nothing to give a woman, is dependent wholly on his\r\npersonal attraction, his courtship is under limitations.\r\n\r\nThey were considering these two things: the advisability of making the\r\nGreat Change; and the degree of personal adaptability which would best\r\nserve that end.\r\n\r\nHere we had the advantage of our small personal experience with those\r\nthree fleet forest girls; and that served to draw us together.\r\n\r\nAs for Ellador: Suppose you come to a strange land and find it pleasant\r\nenough--just a little more than ordinarily pleasant--and then you find\r\nrich farmland, and then gardens, gorgeous gardens, and then palaces\r\nfull of rare and curious treasures--incalculable, inexhaustible, and\r\nthen--mountains--like the Himalayas, and then the sea.\r\n\r\nI liked her that day she balanced on the branch before me and named the\r\ntrio. I thought of her most. Afterward I turned to her like a friend\r\nwhen we met for the third time, and continued the acquaintance. While\r\nJeff's ultra-devotion rather puzzled Celis, really put off their day\r\nof happiness, while Terry and Alima quarreled and parted, re-met and\r\nre-parted, Ellador and I grew to be close friends.\r\n\r\nWe talked and talked. We took long walks together. She showed me things,\r\nexplained them, interpreted much that I had not understood. Through her\r\nsympathetic intelligence I became more and more comprehending of the\r\nspirit of the people of Herland, more and more appreciative of its\r\nmarvelous inner growth as well as outer perfection.\r\n\r\nI ceased to feel a stranger, a prisoner. There was a sense of\r\nunderstanding, of identity, of purpose. We discussed--everything. And,\r\nas I traveled farther and farther, exploring the rich, sweet soul of\r\nher, my sense of pleasant friendship became but a broad foundation for\r\nsuch height, such breadth, such interlocked combination of feeling as\r\nleft me fairly blinded with the wonder of it.\r\n\r\nAs I've said, I had never cared very much for women, nor they for\r\nme--not Terry-fashion. But this one--\r\n\r\nAt first I never even thought of her \"in that way,\" as the girls have\r\nit. I had not come to the country with any Turkish-harem intentions,\r\nand I was no woman-worshipper like Jeff. I just liked that girl \"as a\r\nfriend,\" as we say. That friendship grew like a tree. She was SUCH a\r\ngood sport! We did all kinds of things together. She taught me games and\r\nI taught her games, and we raced and rowed and had all manner of fun, as\r\nwell as higher comradeship.\r\n\r\nThen, as I got on farther, the palace and treasures and snowy mountain\r\nranges opened up. I had never known there could be such a human being.\r\nSo--great. I don't mean talented. She was a forester--one of the\r\nbest--but it was not that gift I mean. When I say GREAT, I mean\r\ngreat--big, all through. If I had known more of those women, as\r\nintimately, I should not have found her so unique; but even among them\r\nshe was noble. Her mother was an Over Mother--and her grandmother, too,\r\nI heard later.\r\n\r\nSo she told me more and more of her beautiful land; and I told her as\r\nmuch, yes, more than I wanted to, about mine; and we became inseparable.\r\nThen this deeper recognition came and grew. I felt my own soul rise\r\nand lift its wings, as it were. Life got bigger. It seemed as if I\r\nunderstood--as I never had before--as if I could Do things--as if I too\r\ncould grow--if she would help me. And then It came--to both of us, all\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nA still day--on the edge of the world, their world. The two of us,\r\ngazing out over the far dim forestland below, talking of heaven and\r\nearth and human life, and of my land and other lands and what they\r\nneeded and what I hoped to do for them--\r\n\r\n\"If you will help me,\" I said.\r\n\r\nShe turned to me, with that high, sweet look of hers, and then, as her\r\neyes rested in mine and her hands too--then suddenly there blazed out\r\nbetween us a farther glory, instant, overwhelming--quite beyond any\r\nwords of mine to tell.\r\n\r\nCelis was a blue-and-gold-and-rose person; Alma,\r\nblack-and-white-and-red, a blazing beauty. Ellador was brown: hair dark\r\nand soft, like a seal coat; clear brown skin with a healthy red in\r\nit; brown eyes--all the way from topaz to black velvet they seemed to\r\nrange--splendid girls, all of them.\r\n\r\nThey had seen us first of all, far down in the lake below, and flashed\r\nthe tidings across the land even before our first exploring flight. They\r\nhad watched our landing, flitted through the forest with us, hidden in\r\nthat tree and--I shrewdly suspect--giggled on purpose.\r\n\r\nThey had kept watch over our hooded machine, taking turns at it; and\r\nwhen our escape was announced, had followed along-side for a day or two,\r\nand been there at the last, as described. They felt a special claim on\r\nus--called us \"their men\"--and when we were at liberty to study the land\r\nand people, and be studied by them, their claim was recognized by the\r\nwise leaders.\r\n\r\nBut I felt, we all did, that we should have chosen them among millions,\r\nunerringly.\r\n\r\nAnd yet \"the path of true love never did run smooth\"; this period of\r\ncourtship was full of the most unsuspected pitfalls.\r\n\r\nWriting this as late as I do, after manifold experiences both in Herland\r\nand, later, in my own land, I can now understand and philosophize about\r\nwhat was then a continual astonishment and often a temporary tragedy.\r\n\r\nThe \"long suit\" in most courtships is sex attraction, of course. Then\r\ngradually develops such comradeship as the two temperaments allow. Then,\r\nafter marriage, there is either the establishment of a slow-growing,\r\nwidely based friendship, the deepest, tenderest, sweetest of relations,\r\nall lit and warmed by the recurrent flame of love; or else that process\r\nis reversed, love cools and fades, no friendship grows, the whole\r\nrelation turns from beauty to ashes.\r\n\r\nHere everything was different. There was no sex-feeling to appeal to, or\r\npractically none. Two thousand years' disuse had left very little of the\r\ninstinct; also we must remember that those who had at times manifested\r\nit as atavistic exceptions were often, by that very fact, denied\r\nmotherhood.\r\n\r\nYet while the mother process remains, the inherent ground for\r\nsex-distinction remains also; and who shall say what long-forgotten\r\nfeeling, vague and nameless, was stirred in some of these mother hearts\r\nby our arrival?\r\n\r\nWhat left us even more at sea in our approach was the lack of any\r\nsex-tradition. There was no accepted standard of what was \"manly\" and\r\nwhat was \"womanly.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Jeff said, taking the fruit basket from his adored one, \"A woman\r\nshould not carry anything,\" Celis said, \"Why?\" with the frankest\r\namazement. He could not look that fleet-footed, deep-chested young\r\nforester in the face and say, \"Because she is weaker.\" She wasn't. One\r\ndoes not call a race horse weak because it is visibly not a cart horse.\r\n\r\nHe said, rather lamely, that women were not built for heavy work.\r\n\r\nShe looked out across the fields to where some women were working,\r\nbuilding a new bit of wall out of large stones; looked back at the\r\nnearest town with its woman-built houses; down at the smooth, hard road\r\nwe were walking on; and then at the little basket he had taken from her.\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand,\" she said quite sweetly. \"Are the women in your\r\ncountry so weak that they could not carry such a thing as that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a convention,\" he said. \"We assume that motherhood is a\r\nsufficient burden--that men should carry all the others.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a beautiful feeling!\" she said, her blue eyes shining.\r\n\r\n\"Does it work?\" asked Alima, in her keen, swift way. \"Do all men in all\r\ncountries carry everything? Or is it only in yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be so literal,\" Terry begged lazily. \"Why aren't you willing to\r\nbe worshipped and waited on? We like to do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't like to have us do it to you,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"That's different,\" he said, annoyed; and when she said, \"Why is it?\" he\r\nquite sulked, referring her to me, saying, \"Van's the philosopher.\"\r\n\r\nEllador and I talked it all out together, so that we had an easier\r\nexperience of it when the real miracle time came. Also, between us, we\r\nmade things clearer to Jeff and Celis. But Terry would not listen to\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nHe was madly in love with Alima. He wanted to take her by storm, and\r\nnearly lost her forever.\r\n\r\nYou see, if a man loves a girl who is in the first place young and\r\ninexperienced; who in the second place is educated with a background\r\nof caveman tradition, a middle-ground of poetry and romance, and a\r\nforeground of unspoken hope and interest all centering upon the one\r\nEvent; and who has, furthermore, absolutely no other hope or interest\r\nworthy of the name--why, it is a comparatively easy matter to sweep\r\nher off her feet with a dashing attack. Terry was a past master in this\r\nprocess. He tried it here, and Alima was so affronted, so repelled, that\r\nit was weeks before he got near enough to try again.\r\n\r\nThe more coldly she denied him, the hotter his determination; he was\r\nnot used to real refusal. The approach of flattery she dismissed with\r\nlaughter, gifts and such \"attentions\" we could not bring to bear, pathos\r\nand complaint of cruelty stirred only a reasoning inquiry. It took Terry\r\na long time.\r\n\r\nI doubt if she ever accepted her strange lover as fully as did Celis\r\nand Ellador theirs. He had hurt and offended her too often; there were\r\nreservations.\r\n\r\nBut I think Alima retained some faint vestige of long-descended feeling\r\nwhich made Terry more possible to her than to others; and that she had\r\nmade up her mind to the experiment and hated to renounce it.\r\n\r\nHowever it came about, we all three at length achieved full\r\nunderstanding, and solemnly faced what was to them a step of measureless\r\nimportance, a grave question as well as a great happiness; to us a\r\nstrange, new joy.\r\n\r\nOf marriage as a ceremony they knew nothing. Jeff was for bringing them\r\nto our country for the religious and the civil ceremony, but neither\r\nCelis nor the others would consent.\r\n\r\n\"We can't expect them to want to go with us--yet,\" said Terry sagely.\r\n\"Wait a bit, boys. We've got to take 'em on their own terms--if at all.\"\r\nThis, in rueful reminiscence of his repeated failures.\r\n\r\n\"But our time's coming,\" he added cheerfully. \"These women have never\r\nbeen mastered, you see--\" This, as one who had made a discovery.\r\n\r\n\"You'd better not try to do any mastering if you value your chances,\"\r\nI told him seriously; but he only laughed, and said, \"Every man to his\r\ntrade!\"\r\n\r\nWe couldn't do anything with him. He had to take his own medicine.\r\n\r\nIf the lack of tradition of courtship left us much at sea in our\r\nwooing, we found ourselves still more bewildered by lack of tradition of\r\nmatrimony.\r\n\r\nAnd here again, I have to draw on later experience, and as deep an\r\nacquaintance with their culture as I could achieve, to explain the gulfs\r\nof difference between us.\r\n\r\nTwo thousand years of one continuous culture with no men. Back of that,\r\nonly traditions of the harem. They had no exact analogue for our word\r\nHOME, any more than they had for our Roman-based FAMILY.\r\n\r\nThey loved one another with a practically universal affection, rising\r\nto exquisite and unbroken friendships, and broadening to a devotion to\r\ntheir country and people for which our word PATRIOTISM is no definition\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nPatriotism, red hot, is compatible with the existence of a neglect of\r\nnational interests, a dishonesty, a cold indifference to the\r\nsuffering of millions. Patriotism is largely pride, and very largely\r\ncombativeness. Patriotism generally has a chip on its shoulder.\r\n\r\nThis country had no other country to measure itself by--save the few\r\npoor savages far below, with whom they had no contact.\r\n\r\nThey loved their country because it was their nursery, playground,\r\nand workshop--theirs and their children's. They were proud of it as a\r\nworkshop, proud of their record of ever-increasing efficiency; they had\r\nmade a pleasant garden of it, a very practical little heaven; but most\r\nof all they valued it--and here it is hard for us to understand them--as\r\na cultural environment for their children.\r\n\r\nThat, of course, is the keynote of the whole distinction--their\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nFrom those first breathlessly guarded, half-adored race mothers, all\r\nup the ascending line, they had this dominant thought of building up a\r\ngreat race through the children.\r\n\r\nAll the surrendering devotion our women have put into their private\r\nfamilies, these women put into their country and race. All the loyalty\r\nand service men expect of wives, they gave, not singly to men, but\r\ncollectively to one another.\r\n\r\nAnd the mother instinct, with us so painfully intense, so thwarted by\r\nconditions, so concentrated in personal devotion to a few, so bitterly\r\nhurt by death, disease, or barrenness, and even by the mere growth\r\nof the children, leaving the mother alone in her empty nest--all this\r\nfeeling with them flowed out in a strong, wide current, unbroken through\r\nthe generations, deepening and widening through the years, including\r\nevery child in all the land.\r\n\r\nWith their united power and wisdom, they had studied and overcome the\r\n\"diseases of childhood\"--their children had none.\r\n\r\nThey had faced the problems of education and so solved them that their\r\nchildren grew up as naturally as young trees; learning through every\r\nsense; taught continuously but unconsciously--never knowing they were\r\nbeing educated.\r\n\r\nIn fact, they did not use the word as we do. Their idea of education was\r\nthe special training they took, when half grown up, under experts. Then\r\nthe eager young minds fairly flung themselves on their chosen subjects,\r\nand acquired with an ease, a breadth, a grasp, at which I never ceased\r\nto wonder.\r\n\r\nBut the babies and little children never felt the pressure of that\r\n\"forcible feeding\" of the mind that we call \"education.\" Of this, more\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. Our Relations and Theirs\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I'm trying to show here is that with these women the whole\r\nrelationship of life counted in a glad, eager growing-up to join the\r\nranks of workers in the line best loved; a deep, tender reverence for\r\none's own mother--too deep for them to speak of freely--and beyond that,\r\nthe whole, free, wide range of sisterhood, the splendid service of the\r\ncountry, and friendships.\r\n\r\nTo these women we came, filled with the ideas, convictions, traditions,\r\nof our culture, and undertook to rouse in them the emotions which--to\r\nus--seemed proper.\r\n\r\nHowever much, or little, of true sex-feeling there was between us, it\r\nphrased itself in their minds in terms of friendship, the one purely\r\npersonal love they knew, and of ultimate parentage. Visibly we were not\r\nmothers, nor children, nor compatriots; so, if they loved us, we must be\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThat we should pair off together in our courting days was natural to\r\nthem; that we three should remain much together, as they did themselves,\r\nwas also natural. We had as yet no work, so we hung about them in their\r\nforest tasks; that was natural, too.\r\n\r\nBut when we began to talk about each couple having \"homes\" of our own,\r\nthey could not understand it.\r\n\r\n\"Our work takes us all around the country,\" explained Celis. \"We cannot\r\nlive in one place all the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are together now,\" urged Alima, looking proudly at Terry's stalwart\r\nnearness. (This was one of the times when they were \"on,\" though\r\npresently \"off\" again.)\r\n\r\n\"It's not the same thing at all,\" he insisted. \"A man wants a home of\r\nhis own, with his wife and family in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Staying in it? All the time?\" asked Ellador. \"Not imprisoned, surely!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not! Living there--naturally,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"What does she do there--all the time?\" Alima demanded. \"What is her\r\nwork?\"\r\n\r\nThen Terry patiently explained again that our women did not work--with\r\nreservations.\r\n\r\n\"But what do they do--if they have no work?\" she persisted.\r\n\r\n\"They take care of the home--and the children.\"\r\n\r\n\"At the same time?\" asked Ellador.\r\n\r\n\"Why yes. The children play about, and the mother has charge of it all.\r\nThere are servants, of course.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed so obvious, so natural to Terry, that he always grew\r\nimpatient; but the girls were honestly anxious to understand.\r\n\r\n\"How many children do your women have?\" Alima had her notebook out now,\r\nand a rather firm set of lip. Terry began to dodge.\r\n\r\n\"There is no set number, my dear,\" he explained. \"Some have more, some\r\nhave less.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some have none at all,\" I put in mischievously.\r\n\r\nThey pounced on this admission and soon wrung from us the general fact\r\nthat those women who had the most children had the least servants, and\r\nthose who had the most servants had the least children.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" triumphed Alima. \"One or two or no children, and three or four\r\nservants. Now what do those women DO?\"\r\n\r\nWe explained as best we might. We talked of \"social duties,\"\r\ndisingenuously banking on their not interpreting the words as we did; we\r\ntalked of hospitality, entertainment, and various \"interests.\" All the\r\ntime we knew that to these large-minded women whose whole mental outlook\r\nwas so collective, the limitations of a wholly personal life were\r\ninconceivable.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot really understand it,\" Ellador concluded. \"We are only half\r\na people. We have our woman-ways and they have their man-ways and their\r\nboth-ways. We have worked out a system of living which is, of course,\r\nlimited. They must have a broader, richer, better one. I should like to\r\nsee it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall, dearest,\" I whispered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing to smoke,\" complained Terry. He was in the midst of a\r\nprolonged quarrel with Alima, and needed a sedative. \"There's nothing to\r\ndrink. These blessed women have no pleasant vices. I wish we could get\r\nout of here!\"\r\n\r\nThis wish was vain. We were always under a certain degree of\r\nwatchfulness. When Terry burst forth to tramp the streets at night he\r\nalways found a \"Colonel\" here or there; and when, on an occasion of\r\nfierce though temporary despair, he had plunged to the cliff edge with\r\nsome vague view to escape, he found several of them close by. We were\r\nfree--but there was a string to it.\r\n\r\n\"They've no unpleasant ones, either,\" Jeff reminded him.\r\n\r\n\"Wish they had!\" Terry persisted. \"They've neither the vices of men, nor\r\nthe virtues of women--they're neuters!\"\r\n\r\n\"You know better than that. Don't talk nonsense,\" said I, severely.\r\n\r\nI was thinking of Ellador's eyes when they gave me a certain look, a\r\nlook she did not at all realize.\r\n\r\nJeff was equally incensed. \"I don't know what 'virtues of women' you\r\nmiss. Seems to me they have all of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"They've no modesty,\" snapped Terry. \"No patience, no submissiveness,\r\nnone of that natural yielding which is woman's greatest charm.\"\r\n\r\nI shook my head pityingly. \"Go and apologize and make friends again,\r\nTerry. You've got a grouch, that's all. These women have the virtue\r\nof humanity, with less of its faults than any folks I ever saw. As for\r\npatience--they'd have pitched us over the cliffs the first day we lit\r\namong 'em, if they hadn't that.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are no--distractions,\" he grumbled. \"Nowhere a man can go and cut\r\nloose a bit. It's an everlasting parlor and nursery.\"\r\n\r\n\"And workshop,\" I added. \"And school, and office, and laboratory, and\r\nstudio, and theater, and--home.\"\r\n\r\n\"HOME!\" he sneered. \"There isn't a home in the whole pitiful place.\"\r\n\r\n\"There isn't anything else, and you know it,\" Jeff retorted hotly. \"I\r\nnever saw, I never dreamed of, such universal peace and good will and\r\nmutual affection.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, of course, if you like a perpetual Sunday school, it's all\r\nvery well. But I like Something Doing. Here it's all done.\"\r\n\r\nThere was something to this criticism. The years of pioneering lay far\r\nbehind them. Theirs was a civilization in which the initial difficulties\r\nhad long since been overcome. The untroubled peace, the unmeasured\r\nplenty, the steady health, the large good will and smooth management\r\nwhich ordered everything, left nothing to overcome. It was like a\r\npleasant family in an old established, perfectly run country place.\r\n\r\nI liked it because of my eager and continued interest in the\r\nsociological achievements involved. Jeff liked it as he would have liked\r\nsuch a family and such a place anywhere.\r\n\r\nTerry did not like it because he found nothing to oppose, to struggle\r\nwith, to conquer.\r\n\r\n\"Life is a struggle, has to be,\" he insisted. \"If there is no struggle,\r\nthere is no life--that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're talking nonsense--masculine nonsense,\" the peaceful Jeff\r\nreplied. He was certainly a warm defender of Herland. \"Ants don't raise\r\ntheir myriads by a struggle, do they? Or the bees?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if you go back to insects--and want to live in an anthill--! I tell\r\nyou the higher grades of life are reached only through struggle--combat.\r\nThere's no Drama here. Look at their plays! They make me sick.\"\r\n\r\nHe rather had us there. The drama of the country was--to our\r\ntaste--rather flat. You see, they lacked the sex motive and, with it,\r\njealousy. They had no interplay of warring nations, no aristocracy and\r\nits ambitions, no wealth and poverty opposition.\r\n\r\nI see I have said little about the economics of the place; it should\r\nhave come before, but I'll go on about the drama now.\r\n\r\nThey had their own kind. There was a most impressive array of pageantry,\r\nof processions, a sort of grand ritual, with their arts and their\r\nreligion broadly blended. The very babies joined in it. To see one of\r\ntheir great annual festivals, with the massed and marching stateliness\r\nof those great mothers, the young women brave and noble, beautiful and\r\nstrong; and then the children, taking part as naturally as ours would\r\nfrolic round a Christmas tree--it was overpowering in the impression of\r\njoyous, triumphant life.\r\n\r\nThey had begun at a period when the drama, the dance, music, religion,\r\nand education were all very close together; and instead of developing\r\nthem in detached lines, they had kept the connection. Let me try again\r\nto give, if I can, a faint sense of the difference in the life view--the\r\nbackground and basis on which their culture rested.\r\n\r\nEllador told me a lot about it. She took me to see the children, the\r\ngrowing girls, the special teachers. She picked out books for me to\r\nread. She always seemed to understand just what I wanted to know, and\r\nhow to give it to me.\r\n\r\nWhile Terry and Alima struck sparks and parted--he always madly drawn\r\nto her and she to him--she must have been, or she'd never have stood the\r\nway he behaved--Ellador and I had already a deep, restful feeling, as\r\nif we'd always had one another. Jeff and Celis were happy; there was no\r\nquestion of that; but it didn't seem to me as if they had the good times\r\nwe did.\r\n\r\nWell, here is the Herland child facing life--as Ellador tried to show\r\nit to me. From the first memory, they knew Peace, Beauty, Order, Safety,\r\nLove, Wisdom, Justice, Patience, and Plenty. By \"plenty\" I mean that the\r\nbabies grew up in an environment which met their needs, just as young\r\nfawns might grow up in dewy forest glades and brook-fed meadows. And\r\nthey enjoyed it as frankly and utterly as the fawns would.\r\n\r\nThey found themselves in a big bright lovely world, full of the most\r\ninteresting and enchanting things to learn about and to do. The people\r\neverywhere were friendly and polite. No Herland child ever met the\r\noverbearing rudeness we so commonly show to children. They were People,\r\ntoo, from the first; the most precious part of the nation.\r\n\r\nIn each step of the rich experience of living, they found the instance\r\nthey were studying widen out into contact with an endless range of\r\ncommon interests. The things they learned were RELATED, from the first;\r\nrelated to one another, and to the national prosperity.\r\n\r\n\"It was a butterfly that made me a forester,\" said Ellador. \"I was about\r\neleven years old, and I found a big purple-and-green butterfly on a low\r\nflower. I caught it, very carefully, by the closed wings, as I had been\r\ntold to do, and carried it to the nearest insect teacher\"--I made a note\r\nthere to ask her what on earth an insect teacher was--\"to ask her its\r\nname. She took it from me with a little cry of delight. 'Oh, you blessed\r\nchild,' she said. 'Do you like obernuts?' Of course I liked obernuts,\r\nand said so. It is our best food-nut, you know. 'This is a female of the\r\nobernut moth,' she told me. 'They are almost gone. We have been trying\r\nto exterminate them for centuries. If you had not caught this one, it\r\nmight have laid eggs enough to raise worms enough to destroy thousands\r\nof our nut trees--thousands of bushels of nuts--and make years and years\r\nof trouble for us.'\r\n\r\n\"Everybody congratulated me. The children all over the country were told\r\nto watch for that moth, if there were any more. I was shown the history\r\nof the creature, and an account of the damage it used to do and of how\r\nlong and hard our foremothers had worked to save that tree for us. I\r\ngrew a foot, it seemed to me, and determined then and there to be a\r\nforester.\"\r\n\r\nThis is but an instance; she showed me many. The big difference was that\r\nwhereas our children grow up in private homes and families, with every\r\neffort made to protect and seclude them from a dangerous world, here\r\nthey grew up in a wide, friendly world, and knew it for theirs, from the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nTheir child-literature was a wonderful thing. I could have spent years\r\nfollowing the delicate subtleties, the smooth simplicities with which\r\nthey had bent that great art to the service of the child mind.\r\n\r\nWe have two life cycles: the man's and the woman's. To the man there is\r\ngrowth, struggle, conquest, the establishment of his family, and as much\r\nfurther success in gain or ambition as he can achieve.\r\n\r\nTo the woman, growth, the securing of a husband, the subordinate\r\nactivities of family life, and afterward such \"social\" or charitable\r\ninterests as her position allows.\r\n\r\nHere was but one cycle, and that a large one.\r\n\r\nThe child entered upon a broad open field of life, in which motherhood\r\nwas the one great personal contribution to the national life, and all\r\nthe rest the individual share in their common activities. Every girl I\r\ntalked to, at any age above babyhood, had her cheerful determination as\r\nto what she was going to be when she grew up.\r\n\r\nWhat Terry meant by saying they had no \"modesty\" was that this great\r\nlife-view had no shady places; they had a high sense of personal\r\ndecorum, but no shame--no knowledge of anything to be ashamed of.\r\n\r\nEven their shortcomings and misdeeds in childhood never were presented\r\nto them as sins; merely as errors and misplays--as in a game. Some of\r\nthem, who were palpably less agreeable than others or who had a real\r\nweakness or fault, were treated with cheerful allowance, as a friendly\r\ngroup at whist would treat a poor player.\r\n\r\nTheir religion, you see, was maternal; and their ethics, based on the\r\nfull perception of evolution, showed the principle of growth and the\r\nbeauty of wise culture. They had no theory of the essential opposition\r\nof good and evil; life to them was growth; their pleasure was in\r\ngrowing, and their duty also.\r\n\r\nWith this background, with their sublimated mother-love, expressed in\r\nterms of widest social activity, every phase of their work was modified\r\nby its effect on the national growth. The language itself they had\r\ndeliberately clarified, simplified, made easy and beautiful, for the\r\nsake of the children.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to us a wholly incredible thing: first, that any nation\r\nshould have the foresight, the strength, and the persistence to plan\r\nand fulfill such a task; and second, that women should have had so much\r\ninitiative. We have assumed, as a matter of course, that women had\r\nnone; that only the man, with his natural energy and impatience of\r\nrestriction, would ever invent anything.\r\n\r\nHere we found that the pressure of life upon the environment develops in\r\nthe human mind its inventive reactions, regardless of sex; and further,\r\nthat a fully awakened motherhood plans and works without limit, for the\r\ngood of the child.\r\n\r\nThat the children might be most nobly born, and reared in an environment\r\ncalculated to allow the richest, freest growth, they had deliberately\r\nremodeled and improved the whole state.\r\n\r\nI do not mean in the least that they stopped at that, any more than\r\na child stops at childhood. The most impressive part of their whole\r\nculture beyond this perfect system of child-rearing was the range of\r\ninterests and associations open to them all, for life. But in the field\r\nof literature I was most struck, at first, by the child-motive.\r\n\r\nThey had the same gradation of simple repetitive verse and story that we\r\nare familiar with, and the most exquisite, imaginative tales; but where,\r\nwith us, these are the dribbled remnants of ancient folk myths and\r\nprimitive lullabies, theirs were the exquisite work of great artists;\r\nnot only simple and unfailing in appeal to the child-mind, but TRUE,\r\ntrue to the living world about them.\r\n\r\nTo sit in one of their nurseries for a day was to change one's views\r\nforever as to babyhood. The youngest ones, rosy fatlings in their\r\nmothers' arms, or sleeping lightly in the flower-sweet air, seemed\r\nnatural enough, save that they never cried. I never heard a child cry in\r\nHerland, save once or twice at a bad fall; and then people ran to help,\r\nas we would at a scream of agony from a grown person.\r\n\r\nEach mother had her year of glory; the time to love and learn, living\r\nclosely with her child, nursing it proudly, often for two years or more.\r\nThis perhaps was one reason for their wonderful vigor.\r\n\r\nBut after the baby-year the mother was not so constantly in attendance,\r\nunless, indeed, her work was among the little ones. She was never\r\nfar off, however, and her attitude toward the co-mothers, whose proud\r\nchild-service was direct and continuous, was lovely to see.\r\n\r\nAs for the babies--a group of those naked darlings playing on short\r\nvelvet grass, clean-swept; or rugs as soft; or in shallow pools of\r\nbright water; tumbling over with bubbling joyous baby laughter--it was a\r\nview of infant happiness such as I had never dreamed.\r\n\r\nThe babies were reared in the warmer part of the country, and gradually\r\nacclimated to the cooler heights as they grew older.\r\n\r\nSturdy children of ten and twelve played in the snow as joyfully as ours\r\ndo; there were continuous excursions of them, from one part of the land\r\nto another, so that to each child the whole country might be home.\r\n\r\nIt was all theirs, waiting for them to learn, to love, to use, to serve;\r\nas our own little boys plan to be \"a big soldier,\" or \"a cowboy,\" or\r\nwhatever pleases their fancy; and our little girls plan for the kind of\r\nhome they mean to have, or how many children; these planned, freely and\r\ngaily with much happy chattering, of what they would do for the country\r\nwhen they were grown.\r\n\r\nIt was the eager happiness of the children and young people which first\r\nmade me see the folly of that common notion of ours--that if life was\r\nsmooth and happy, people would not enjoy it.\r\n\r\nAs I studied these youngsters, vigorous, joyous, eager little creatures,\r\nand their voracious appetite for life, it shook my previous ideas so\r\nthoroughly that they have never been re-established. The steady level of\r\ngood health gave them all that natural stimulus we used to call \"animal\r\nspirits\"--an odd contradiction in terms. They found themselves in an\r\nimmediate environment which was agreeable and interesting, and before\r\nthem stretched the years of learning and discovery, the fascinating,\r\nendless process of education.\r\n\r\nAs I looked into these methods and compared them with our own, my\r\nstrange uncomfortable sense of race-humility grew apace.\r\n\r\nEllador could not understand my astonishment. She explained things\r\nkindly and sweetly, but with some amazement that they needed explaining,\r\nand with sudden questions as to how we did it that left me meeker than\r\never.\r\n\r\nI betook myself to Somel one day, carefully not taking Ellador. I did\r\nnot mind seeming foolish to Somel--she was used to it.\r\n\r\n\"I want a chapter of explanation,\" I told her. \"You know my stupidities\r\nby heart, and I do not want to show them to Ellador--she thinks me so\r\nwise!\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled delightedly. \"It is beautiful to see,\" she told me, \"this\r\nnew wonderful love between you. The whole country is interested, you\r\nknow--how can we help it!\"\r\n\r\nI had not thought of that. We say: \"All the world loves a lover,\" but\r\nto have a couple of million people watching one's courtship--and that a\r\ndifficult one--was rather embarrassing.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me about your theory of education,\" I said. \"Make it short and\r\neasy. And, to show you what puzzles me, I'll tell you that in our theory\r\ngreat stress is laid on the forced exertion of the child's mind; we\r\nthink it is good for him to overcome obstacles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course it is,\" she unexpectedly agreed. \"All our children do\r\nthat--they love to.\"\r\n\r\nThat puzzled me again. If they loved to do it, how could it be\r\neducational?\r\n\r\n\"Our theory is this,\" she went on carefully. \"Here is a young human\r\nbeing. The mind is as natural a thing as the body, a thing that grows,\r\na thing to use and enjoy. We seek to nourish, to stimulate, to exercise\r\nthe mind of a child as we do the body. There are the two main divisions\r\nin education--you have those of course?--the things it is necessary to\r\nknow, and the things it is necessary to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"To do? Mental exercises, you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Our general plan is this: In the matter of feeding the mind,\r\nof furnishing information, we use our best powers to meet the natural\r\nappetite of a healthy young brain; not to overfeed it, to provide such\r\namount and variety of impressions as seem most welcome to each child.\r\nThat is the easiest part. The other division is in arranging a properly\r\ngraduated series of exercises which will best develop each mind; the\r\ncommon faculties we all have, and most carefully, the especial faculties\r\nsome of us have. You do this also, do you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a way,\" I said rather lamely. \"We have not so subtle and highly\r\ndeveloped a system as you, not approaching it; but tell me more. As\r\nto the information--how do you manage? It appears that all of you know\r\npretty much everything--is that right?\"\r\n\r\nThis she laughingly disclaimed. \"By no means. We are, as you soon found\r\nout, extremely limited in knowledge. I wish you could realize what a\r\nferment the country is in over the new things you have told us; the\r\npassionate eagerness among thousands of us to go to your country and\r\nlearn--learn--learn! But what we do know is readily divisible into\r\ncommon knowledge and special knowledge. The common knowledge we have\r\nlong since learned to feed into the minds of our little ones with no\r\nwaste of time or strength; the special knowledge is open to all, as\r\nthey desire it. Some of us specialize in one line only. But most take up\r\nseveral--some for their regular work, some to grow with.\"\r\n\r\n\"To grow with?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. When one settles too close in one kind of work there is a tendency\r\nto atrophy in the disused portions of the brain. We like to keep on\r\nlearning, always.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you study?\"\r\n\r\n\"As much as we know of the different sciences. We have, within our\r\nlimits, a good deal of knowledge of anatomy, physiology, nutrition--all\r\nthat pertains to a full and beautiful personal life. We have our botany\r\nand chemistry, and so on--very rudimentary, but interesting; our own\r\nhistory, with its accumulating psychology.\"\r\n\r\n\"You put psychology with history--not with personal life?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. It is ours; it is among and between us, and it changes with\r\nthe succeeding and improving generations. We are at work, slowly and\r\ncarefully, developing our whole people along these lines. It is glorious\r\nwork--splendid! To see the thousands of babies improving, showing\r\nstronger clearer minds, sweeter dispositions, higher capacities--don't\r\nyou find it so in your country?\"\r\n\r\nThis I evaded flatly. I remembered the cheerless claim that the human\r\nmind was no better than in its earliest period of savagery, only better\r\ninformed--a statement I had never believed.\r\n\r\n\"We try most earnestly for two powers,\" Somel continued. \"The two that\r\nseem to us basically necessary for all noble life: a clear, far-reaching\r\njudgment, and a strong well-used will. We spend our best efforts, all\r\nthrough childhood and youth, in developing these faculties, individual\r\njudgment and will.\"\r\n\r\n\"As part of your system of education, you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. As the most valuable part. With the babies, as you may have\r\nnoticed, we first provide an environment which feeds the mind without\r\ntiring it; all manner of simple and interesting things to do, as soon\r\nas they are old enough to do them; physical properties, of course, come\r\nfirst. But as early as possible, going very carefully, not to tax the\r\nmind, we provide choices, simple choices, with very obvious causes and\r\nconsequences. You've noticed the games?\"\r\n\r\nI had. The children seemed always playing something; or else, sometimes,\r\nengaged in peaceful researches of their own. I had wondered at first\r\nwhen they went to school, but soon found that they never did--to their\r\nknowledge. It was all education but no schooling.\r\n\r\n\"We have been working for some sixteen hundred years, devising better\r\nand better games for children,\" continued Somel.\r\n\r\nI sat aghast. \"Devising games?\" I protested. \"Making up new ones, you\r\nmean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" she answered. \"Don't you?\"\r\n\r\nThen I remembered the kindergarten, and the \"material\" devised by\r\nSignora Montessori, and guardedly replied: \"To some extent.\" But most\r\nof our games, I told her, were very old--came down from child to child,\r\nalong the ages, from the remote past.\r\n\r\n\"And what is their effect?\" she asked. \"Do they develop the faculties\r\nyou wish to encourage?\"\r\n\r\nAgain I remembered the claims made by the advocates of \"sports,\" and\r\nagain replied guardedly that that was, in part, the theory.\r\n\r\n\"But do the children LIKE it?\" I asked. \"Having things made up and set\r\nbefore them that way? Don't they want the old games?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can see the children,\" she answered. \"Are yours more\r\ncontented--more interested--happier?\"\r\n\r\nThen I thought, as in truth I never had thought before, of the dull,\r\nbored children I had seen, whining; \"What can I do now?\"; of the little\r\ngroups and gangs hanging about; of the value of some one strong spirit\r\nwho possessed initiative and would \"start something\"; of the children's\r\nparties and the onerous duties of the older people set to \"amuse the\r\nchildren\"; also of that troubled ocean of misdirected activity we call\r\n\"mischief,\" the foolish, destructive, sometimes evil things done by\r\nunoccupied children.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said I grimly. \"I don't think they are.\"\r\n\r\nThe Herland child was born not only into a world carefully prepared,\r\nfull of the most fascinating materials and opportunities to learn, but\r\ninto the society of plentiful numbers of teachers, teachers born and\r\ntrained, whose business it was to accompany the children along that, to\r\nus, impossible thing--the royal road to learning.\r\n\r\nThere was no mystery in their methods. Being adapted to children it was\r\nat least comprehensible to adults. I spent many days with the little\r\nones, sometimes with Ellador, sometimes without, and began to feel a\r\ncrushing pity for my own childhood, and for all others that I had known.\r\n\r\nThe houses and gardens planned for babies had in them nothing to\r\nhurt--no stairs, no corners, no small loose objects to swallow, no\r\nfire--just a babies' paradise. They were taught, as rapidly as\r\nfeasible, to use and control their own bodies, and never did I see such\r\nsure-footed, steady-handed, clear-headed little things. It was a joy\r\nto watch a row of toddlers learning to walk, not only on a level floor,\r\nbut, a little later, on a sort of rubber rail raised an inch or two\r\nabove the soft turf or heavy rugs, and falling off with shrieks of\r\ninfant joy, to rush back to the end of the line and try again. Surely we\r\nhave noticed how children love to get up on something and walk along it!\r\nBut we have never thought to provide that simple and inexhaustible form\r\nof amusement and physical education for the young.\r\n\r\nWater they had, of course, and could swim even before they walked. If I\r\nfeared at first the effects of a too intensive system of culture, that\r\nfear was dissipated by seeing the long sunny days of pure physical\r\nmerriment and natural sleep in which these heavenly babies passed their\r\nfirst years. They never knew they were being educated. They did not\r\ndream that in this association of hilarious experiment and achievement\r\nthey were laying the foundation for that close beautiful group feeling\r\ninto which they grew so firmly with the years. This was education for\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10. Their Religions and Our Marriages\r\n\r\n\r\nIt took me a long time, as a man, a foreigner, and a species\r\nof Christian--I was that as much as anything--to get any clear\r\nunderstanding of the religion of Herland.\r\n\r\nIts deification of motherhood was obvious enough; but there was far more\r\nto it than that; or, at least, than my first interpretation of that.\r\n\r\nI think it was only as I grew to love Ellador more than I believed\r\nanyone could love anybody, as I grew faintly to appreciate her inner\r\nattitude and state of mind, that I began to get some glimpses of this\r\nfaith of theirs.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked her about it, she tried at first to tell me, and then,\r\nseeing me flounder, asked for more information about ours. She soon\r\nfound that we had many, that they varied widely, but had some points\r\nin common. A clear methodical luminous mind had my Ellador, not only\r\nreasonable, but swiftly perceptive.\r\n\r\nShe made a sort of chart, superimposing the different religions as\r\nI described them, with a pin run through them all, as it were; their\r\ncommon basis being a Dominant Power or Powers, and some Special\r\nBehavior, mostly taboos, to please or placate. There were some common\r\nfeatures in certain groups of religions, but the one always present was\r\nthis Power, and the things which must be done or not done because of\r\nit. It was not hard to trace our human imagery of the Divine Force up\r\nthrough successive stages of bloodthirsty, sensual, proud, and cruel\r\ngods of early times to the conception of a Common Father with its\r\ncorollary of a Common Brotherhood.\r\n\r\nThis pleased her very much, and when I expatiated on the Omniscience,\r\nOmnipotence, Omnipresence, and so on, of our God, and of the loving\r\nkindness taught by his Son, she was much impressed.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Virgin birth naturally did not astonish her, but she\r\nwas greatly puzzled by the Sacrifice, and still more by the Devil, and\r\nthe theory of Damnation.\r\n\r\nWhen in an inadvertent moment I said that certain sects had believed in\r\ninfant damnation--and explained it--she sat very still indeed.\r\n\r\n\"They believed that God was Love--and Wisdom--and Power?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--all of that.\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes grew large, her face ghastly pale.\r\n\r\n\"And yet that such a God could put little new babies to burn--for\r\neternity?\" She fell into a sudden shuddering and left me, running\r\nswiftly to the nearest temple.\r\n\r\nEvery smallest village had its temple, and in those gracious retreats\r\nsat wise and noble women, quietly busy at some work of their own until\r\nthey were wanted, always ready to give comfort, light, or help, to any\r\napplicant.\r\n\r\nEllador told me afterward how easily this grief of hers was assuaged,\r\nand seemed ashamed of not having helped herself out of it.\r\n\r\n\"You see, we are not accustomed to horrible ideas,\" she said, coming\r\nback to me rather apologetically. \"We haven't any. And when we get a\r\nthing like that into our minds it's like--oh, like red pepper in your\r\neyes. So I just ran to her, blinded and almost screaming, and she took\r\nit out so quickly--so easily!\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" I asked, very curious.\r\n\r\n\"'Why, you blessed child,' she said, 'you've got the wrong idea\r\naltogether. You do not have to think that there ever was such a God--for\r\nthere wasn't. Or such a happening--for there wasn't. Nor even that this\r\nhideous false idea was believed by anybody. But only this--that people\r\nwho are utterly ignorant will believe anything--which you certainly knew\r\nbefore.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Anyhow,\" pursued Ellador, \"she turned pale for a minute when I first\r\nsaid it.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a lesson to me. No wonder this whole nation of women was\r\npeaceful and sweet in expression--they had no horrible ideas.\r\n\r\n\"Surely you had some when you began,\" I suggested.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, no doubt. But as soon as our religion grew to any height at\r\nall we left them out, of course.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this, as from many other things, I grew to see what I finally put\r\nin words.\r\n\r\n\"Have you no respect for the past? For what was thought and believed by\r\nyour foremothers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, no,\" she said. \"Why should we? They are all gone. They knew less\r\nthan we do. If we are not beyond them, we are unworthy of them--and\r\nunworthy of the children who must go beyond us.\"\r\n\r\nThis set me thinking in good earnest. I had always imagined--simply from\r\nhearing it said, I suppose--that women were by nature conservative. Yet\r\nthese women, quite unassisted by any masculine spirit of enterprise, had\r\nignored their past and built daringly for the future.\r\n\r\nEllador watched me think. She seemed to know pretty much what was going\r\non in my mind.\r\n\r\n\"It's because we began in a new way, I suppose. All our folks were swept\r\naway at once, and then, after that time of despair, came those wonder\r\nchildren--the first. And then the whole breathless hope of us was for\r\nTHEIR children--if they should have them. And they did! Then there was\r\nthe period of pride and triumph till we grew too numerous; and after\r\nthat, when it all came down to one child apiece, we began to really\r\nwork--to make better ones.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how does this account for such a radical difference in your\r\nreligion?\" I persisted.\r\n\r\nShe said she couldn't talk about the difference very intelligently,\r\nnot being familiar with other religions, but that theirs seemed simple\r\nenough. Their great Mother Spirit was to them what their own motherhood\r\nwas--only magnified beyond human limits. That meant that they\r\nfelt beneath and behind them an upholding, unfailing, serviceable\r\nlove--perhaps it was really the accumulated mother-love of the race they\r\nfelt--but it was a Power.\r\n\r\n\"Just what is your theory of worship?\" I asked her.\r\n\r\n\"Worship? What is that?\"\r\n\r\nI found it singularly difficult to explain. This Divine Love which they\r\nfelt so strongly did not seem to ask anything of them--\"any more than\r\nour mothers do,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"But surely your mothers expect honor, reverence, obedience, from you.\r\nYou have to do things for your mothers, surely?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" she insisted, smiling, shaking her soft brown hair. \"We do\r\nthings FROM our mothers--not FOR them. We don't have to do things\r\nFOR them--they don't need it, you know. But we have to live\r\non--splendidly--because of them; and that's the way we feel about God.\"\r\n\r\nI meditated again. I thought of that God of Battles of ours,\r\nthat Jealous God, that Vengeance-is-mine God. I thought of our\r\nworld-nightmare--Hell.\r\n\r\n\"You have no theory of eternal punishment then, I take it?\"\r\n\r\nEllador laughed. Her eyes were as bright as stars, and there were tears\r\nin them, too. She was so sorry for me.\r\n\r\n\"How could we?\" she asked, fairly enough. \"We have no punishments in\r\nlife, you see, so we don't imagine them after death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you NO punishments? Neither for children nor criminals--such mild\r\ncriminals as you have?\" I urged.\r\n\r\n\"Do you punish a person for a broken leg or a fever? We have preventive\r\nmeasures, and cures; sometimes we have to 'send the patient to bed,' as\r\nit were; but that's not a punishment--it's only part of the treatment,\"\r\nshe explained.\r\n\r\nThen studying my point of view more closely, she added: \"You see, we\r\nrecognize, in our human motherhood, a great tender limitless uplifting\r\nforce--patience and wisdom and all subtlety of delicate method. We\r\ncredit God--our idea of God--with all that and more. Our mothers are not\r\nangry with us--why should God be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Does God mean a person to you?\"\r\n\r\nThis she thought over a little. \"Why--in trying to get close to it in\r\nour minds we personify the idea, naturally; but we certainly do\r\nnot assume a Big Woman somewhere, who is God. What we call God is a\r\nPervading Power, you know, an Indwelling Spirit, something inside of us\r\nthat we want more of. Is your God a Big Man?\" she asked innocently.\r\n\r\n\"Why--yes, to most of us, I think. Of course we call it an Indwelling\r\nSpirit just as you do, but we insist that it is Him, a Person, and a\r\nMan--with whiskers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whiskers? Oh yes--because you have them! Or do you wear them because He\r\ndoes?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, we shave them off--because it seems cleaner and more\r\ncomfortable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does He wear clothes--in your idea, I mean?\"\r\n\r\nI was thinking over the pictures of God I had seen--rash advances of the\r\ndevout mind of man, representing his Omnipotent Deity as an old man in\r\na flowing robe, flowing hair, flowing beard, and in the light of her\r\nperfectly frank and innocent questions this concept seemed rather\r\nunsatisfying.\r\n\r\nI explained that the God of the Christian world was really the ancient\r\nHebrew God, and that we had simply taken over the patriarchal idea--that\r\nancient one which quite inevitably clothed its thought of God with the\r\nattributes of the patriarchal ruler, the grandfather.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" she said eagerly, after I had explained the genesis and\r\ndevelopment of our religious ideals. \"They lived in separate groups,\r\nwith a male head, and he was probably a little--domineering?\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt of that,\" I agreed.\r\n\r\n\"And we live together without any 'head,' in that sense--just our chosen\r\nleaders--that DOES make a difference.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your difference is deeper than that,\" I assured her. \"It is in your\r\ncommon motherhood. Your children grow up in a world where everybody\r\nloves them. They find life made rich and happy for them by the diffused\r\nlove and wisdom of all mothers. So it is easy for you to think of God in\r\nthe terms of a similar diffused and competent love. I think you are far\r\nnearer right than we are.\"\r\n\r\n\"What I cannot understand,\" she pursued carefully, \"is your preservation\r\nof such a very ancient state of mind. This patriarchal idea you tell me\r\nis thousands of years old?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes--four, five, six thousand--every so many.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you have made wonderful progress in those years--in other things?\"\r\n\r\n\"We certainly have. But religion is different. You see, our religions\r\ncome from behind us, and are initiated by some great teacher who is\r\ndead. He is supposed to have known the whole thing and taught it,\r\nfinally. All we have to do is believe--and obey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was the great Hebrew teacher?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh--there it was different. The Hebrew religion is an accumulation of\r\nextremely ancient traditions, some far older than their people, and grew\r\nby accretion down the ages. We consider it inspired--'the Word of God.'\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know it is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it says so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it say so in as many words? Who wrote that in?\"\r\n\r\nI began to try to recall some text that did say so, and could not bring\r\nit to mind.\r\n\r\n\"Apart from that,\" she pursued, \"what I cannot understand is why you\r\nkeep these early religious ideas so long. You have changed all your\r\nothers, haven't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pretty generally,\" I agreed. \"But this we call 'revealed religion,'\r\nand think it is final. But tell me more about these little temples of\r\nyours,\" I urged. \"And these Temple Mothers you run to.\"\r\n\r\nThen she gave me an extended lesson in applied religion, which I will\r\nendeavor to concentrate.\r\n\r\nThey developed their central theory of a Loving Power, and assumed that\r\nits relation to them was motherly--that it desired their welfare and\r\nespecially their development. Their relation to it, similarly, was\r\nfilial, a loving appreciation and a glad fulfillment of its high\r\npurposes. Then, being nothing if not practical, they set their keen\r\nand active minds to discover the kind of conduct expected of them. This\r\nworked out in a most admirable system of ethics. The principle of Love\r\nwas universally recognized--and used.\r\n\r\nPatience, gentleness, courtesy, all that we call \"good breeding,\" was\r\npart of their code of conduct. But where they went far beyond us was\r\nin the special application of religious feeling to every field of\r\nlife. They had no ritual, no little set of performances called \"divine\r\nservice,\" save those religious pageants I have spoken of, and those were\r\nas much educational as religious, and as much social as either. But they\r\nhad a clear established connection between everything they did--and\r\nGod. Their cleanliness, their health, their exquisite order, the rich\r\npeaceful beauty of the whole land, the happiness of the children, and\r\nabove all the constant progress they made--all this was their religion.\r\n\r\nThey applied their minds to the thought of God, and worked out the\r\ntheory that such an inner power demanded outward expression. They lived\r\nas if God was real and at work within them.\r\n\r\nAs for those little temples everywhere--some of the women were more\r\nskilled, more temperamentally inclined, in this direction, than others.\r\nThese, whatever their work might be, gave certain hours to the Temple\r\nService, which meant being there with all their love and wisdom and\r\ntrained thought, to smooth out rough places for anyone who needed it.\r\nSometimes it was a real grief, very rarely a quarrel, most often a\r\nperplexity; even in Herland the human soul had its hours of darkness.\r\nBut all through the country their best and wisest were ready to give\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\nIf the difficulty was unusually profound, the applicant was directed to\r\nsomeone more specially experienced in that line of thought.\r\n\r\nHere was a religion which gave to the searching mind a rational basis\r\nin life, the concept of an immense Loving Power working steadily out\r\nthrough them, toward good. It gave to the \"soul\" that sense of contact\r\nwith the inmost force, of perception of the uttermost purpose, which we\r\nalways crave. It gave to the \"heart\" the blessed feeling of being loved,\r\nloved and UNDERSTOOD. It gave clear, simple, rational directions as\r\nto how we should live--and why. And for ritual it gave first those\r\ntriumphant group demonstrations, when with a union of all the arts,\r\nthe revivifying combination of great multitudes moved rhythmically with\r\nmarch and dance, song and music, among their own noblest products\r\nand the open beauty of their groves and hills. Second, it gave these\r\nnumerous little centers of wisdom where the least wise could go to the\r\nmost wise and be helped.\r\n\r\n\"It is beautiful!\" I cried enthusiastically. \"It is the most practical,\r\ncomforting, progressive religion I ever heard of. You DO love one\r\nanother--you DO bear one another's burdens--you DO realize that a little\r\nchild is a type of the kingdom of heaven. You are more Christian than\r\nany people I ever saw. But--how about death? And the life everlasting?\r\nWhat does your religion teach about eternity?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" said Ellador. \"What is eternity?\"\r\n\r\nWhat indeed? I tried, for the first time in my life, to get a real hold\r\non the idea.\r\n\r\n\"It is--never stopping.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never stopping?\" She looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, life, going on forever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh--we see that, of course. Life does go on forever, all about us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But eternal life goes on WITHOUT DYING.\"\r\n\r\n\"The same person?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the same person, unending, immortal.\" I was pleased to think\r\nthat I had something to teach from our religion, which theirs had never\r\npromulgated.\r\n\r\n\"Here?\" asked Ellador. \"Never to die--here?\" I could see her practical\r\nmind heaping up the people, and hurriedly reassured her.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, indeed, not here--hereafter. We must die here, of course, but\r\nthen we 'enter into eternal life.' The soul lives forever.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\" she inquired.\r\n\r\n\"I won't attempt to prove it to you,\" I hastily continued. \"Let us\r\nassume it to be so. How does this idea strike you?\"\r\n\r\nAgain she smiled at me, that adorable, dimpling, tender, mischievous,\r\nmotherly smile of hers. \"Shall I be quite, quite honest?\"\r\n\r\n\"You couldn't be anything else,\" I said, half gladly and half a little\r\nsorry. The transparent honesty of these women was a never-ending\r\nastonishment to me.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me a singularly foolish idea,\" she said calmly. \"And if\r\ntrue, most disagreeable.\"\r\n\r\nNow I had always accepted the doctrine of personal immortality as\r\na thing established. The efforts of inquiring spiritualists, always\r\nseeking to woo their beloved ghosts back again, never seemed to me\r\nnecessary. I don't say I had ever seriously and courageously discussed\r\nthe subject with myself even; I had simply assumed it to be a fact.\r\nAnd here was the girl I loved, this creature whose character constantly\r\nrevealed new heights and ranges far beyond my own, this superwoman of a\r\nsuperland, saying she thought immortality foolish! She meant it, too.\r\n\r\n\"What do you WANT it for?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"How can you NOT want it!\" I protested. \"Do you want to go out like a\r\ncandle? Don't you want to go on and on--growing and--and--being happy,\r\nforever?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, no,\" she said. \"I don't in the least. I want my child--and my\r\nchild's child--to go on--and they will. Why should _I_ want to?\"\r\n\r\n\"But it means Heaven!\" I insisted. \"Peace and Beauty and Comfort\r\nand Love--with God.\" I had never been so eloquent on the subject of\r\nreligion. She could be horrified at Damnation, and question the justice\r\nof Salvation, but Immortality--that was surely a noble faith.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Van,\" she said, holding out her hands to me. \"Why Van--darling!\r\nHow splendid of you to feel it so keenly. That's what we all want, of\r\ncourse--Peace and Beauty, and Comfort and Love--with God! And Progress\r\ntoo, remember; Growth, always and always. That is what our religion\r\nteaches us to want and to work for, and we do!\"\r\n\r\n\"But that is HERE,\" I said, \"only for this life on earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well? And do not you in your country, with your beautiful religion of\r\nlove and service have it here, too--for this life--on earth?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNone of us were willing to tell the women of Herland about the evils of\r\nour own beloved land. It was all very well for us to assume them to\r\nbe necessary and essential, and to criticize--strictly among\r\nourselves--their all-too-perfect civilization, but when it came to\r\ntelling them about the failures and wastes of our own, we never could\r\nbring ourselves to do it.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we sought to avoid too much discussion, and to press the\r\nsubject of our approaching marriages.\r\n\r\nJeff was the determined one on this score.\r\n\r\n\"Of course they haven't any marriage ceremony or service, but we can\r\nmake it a sort of Quaker wedding, and have it in the temple--it is the\r\nleast we can do for them.\"\r\n\r\nIt was. There was so little, after all, that we could do for them. Here\r\nwe were, penniless guests and strangers, with no chance even to use\r\nour strength and courage--nothing to defend them from or protect them\r\nagainst.\r\n\r\n\"We can at least give them our names,\" Jeff insisted.\r\n\r\nThey were very sweet about it, quite willing to do whatever we asked, to\r\nplease us. As to the names, Alima, frank soul that she was, asked what\r\ngood it would do.\r\n\r\nTerry, always irritating her, said it was a sign of possession. \"You are\r\ngoing to be Mrs. Nicholson,\" he said. \"Mrs. T. O. Nicholson. That shows\r\neveryone that you are my wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is a 'wife' exactly?\" she demanded, a dangerous gleam in her eye.\r\n\r\n\"A wife is the woman who belongs to a man,\" he began.\r\n\r\nBut Jeff took it up eagerly: \"And a husband is the man who belongs to\r\na woman. It is because we are monogamous, you know. And marriage is the\r\nceremony, civil and religious, that joins the two together--'until death\r\ndo us part,'\" he finished, looking at Celis with unutterable devotion.\r\n\r\n\"What makes us all feel foolish,\" I told the girls, \"is that here we\r\nhave nothing to give you--except, of course, our names.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do your women have no names before they are married?\" Celis suddenly\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes,\" Jeff explained. \"They have their maiden names--their\r\nfather's names, that is.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what becomes of them?\" asked Alima.\r\n\r\n\"They change them for their husbands', my dear,\" Terry answered her.\r\n\r\n\"Change them? Do the husbands then take the wives' 'maiden names'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" he laughed. \"The man keeps his own and gives it to her, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then she just loses hers and takes a new one--how unpleasant! We won't\r\ndo that!\" Alima said decidedly.\r\n\r\nTerry was good-humored about it. \"I don't care what you do or don't do\r\nso long as we have that wedding pretty soon,\" he said, reaching a strong\r\nbrown hand after Alima's, quite as brown and nearly as strong.\r\n\r\n\"As to giving us things--of course we can see that you'd like to, but\r\nwe are glad you can't,\" Celis continued. \"You see, we love you just for\r\nyourselves--we wouldn't want you to--to pay anything. Isn't it enough to\r\nknow that you are loved personally--and just as men?\"\r\n\r\nEnough or not, that was the way we were married. We had a great triple\r\nwedding in the biggest temple of all, and it looked as if most of the\r\nnation was present. It was very solemn and very beautiful. Someone had\r\nwritten a new song for the occasion, nobly beautiful, about the New Hope\r\nfor their people--the New Tie with other lands--Brotherhood as well as\r\nSisterhood, and, with evident awe, Fatherhood.\r\n\r\nTerry was always restive under their talk of fatherhood. \"Anybody'd\r\nthink we were High Priests of--of Philoprogenitiveness!\" he protested.\r\n\"These women think of NOTHING but children, seems to me! We'll teach\r\n'em!\"\r\n\r\nHe was so certain of what he was going to teach, and Alima so uncertain\r\nin her moods of reception, that Jeff and I feared the worst. We tried to\r\ncaution him--much good that did. The big handsome fellow drew himself up\r\nto his full height, lifted that great chest of his, and laughed.\r\n\r\n\"There are three separate marriages,\" he said. \"I won't interfere with\r\nyours--nor you with mine.\"\r\n\r\nSo the great day came, and the countless crowds of women, and we three\r\nbridegrooms without any supporting \"best men,\" or any other men to back\r\nus up, felt strangely small as we came forward.\r\n\r\nSomel and Zava and Moadine were on hand; we were thankful to have them,\r\ntoo--they seemed almost like relatives.\r\n\r\nThere was a splendid procession, wreathing dances, the new anthem I\r\nspoke of, and the whole great place pulsed with feeling--the deep awe,\r\nthe sweet hope, the wondering expectation of a new miracle.\r\n\r\n\"There has been nothing like this in the country since our Motherhood\r\nbegan!\" Somel said softly to me, while we watched the symbolic marches.\r\n\"You see, it is the dawn of a new era. You don't know how much you mean\r\nto us. It is not only Fatherhood--that marvelous dual parentage to\r\nwhich we are strangers--the miracle of union in life-giving--but it is\r\nBrotherhood. You are the rest of the world. You join us to our kind--to\r\nall the strange lands and peoples we have never seen. We hope to know\r\nthem--to love and help them--and to learn of them. Ah! You cannot know!\"\r\n\r\nThousands of voices rose in the soaring climax of that great Hymn of The\r\nComing Life. By the great Altar of Motherhood, with its crown of fruit\r\nand flowers, stood a new one, crowned as well. Before the Great Over\r\nMother of the Land and her ring of High Temple Counsellors, before that\r\nvast multitude of calm-faced mothers and holy-eyed maidens, came forward\r\nour own three chosen ones, and we, three men alone in all that land,\r\njoined hands with them and made our marriage vows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11. Our Difficulties\r\n\r\n\r\nWe say, \"Marriage is a lottery\"; also \"Marriages are made in\r\nHeaven\"--but this is not so widely accepted as the other.\r\n\r\nWe have a well-founded theory that it is best to marry \"in one's class,\"\r\nand certain well-grounded suspicions of international marriages, which\r\nseem to persist in the interests of social progress, rather than in\r\nthose of the contracting parties.\r\n\r\nBut no combination of alien races, of color, of caste, or creed, was\r\never so basically difficult to establish as that between us, three\r\nmodern American men, and these three women of Herland.\r\n\r\nIt is all very well to say that we should have been frank about it\r\nbeforehand. We had been frank. We had discussed--at least Ellador and\r\nI had--the conditions of The Great Adventure, and thought the path\r\nwas clear before us. But there are some things one takes for granted,\r\nsupposes are mutually understood, and to which both parties may\r\nrepeatedly refer without ever meaning the same thing.\r\n\r\nThe differences in the education of the average man and woman are\r\ngreat enough, but the trouble they make is not mostly for the man; he\r\ngenerally carries out his own views of the case. The woman may have\r\nimagined the conditions of married life to be different; but what she\r\nimagined, was ignorant of, or might have preferred, did not seriously\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nI can see clearly and speak calmly about this now, writing after a lapse\r\nof years, years full of growth and education, but at the time it was\r\nrather hard sledding for all of us--especially for Terry. Poor Terry!\r\nYou see, in any other imaginable marriage among the peoples of the\r\nearth, whether the woman were black, red, yellow, brown, or white;\r\nwhether she were ignorant or educated, submissive or rebellious, she\r\nwould have behind her the marriage tradition of our general history.\r\nThis tradition relates the woman to the man. He goes on with his\r\nbusiness, and she adapts herself to him and to it. Even in citizenship,\r\nby some strange hocus-pocus, that fact of birth and geography was waved\r\naside, and the woman automatically acquired the nationality of her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nWell--here were we, three aliens in this land of women. It was small in\r\narea, and the external differences were not so great as to astound us.\r\nWe did not yet appreciate the differences between the race-mind of this\r\npeople and ours.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, they were a \"pure stock\" of two thousand\r\nuninterrupted years. Where we have some long connected lines of\r\nthought and feeling, together with a wide range of differences, often\r\nirreconcilable, these people were smoothly and firmly agreed on most of\r\nthe basic principles of their life; and not only agreed in principle,\r\nbut accustomed for these sixty-odd generations to act on those\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nThis is one thing which we did not understand--had made no allowance\r\nfor. When in our pre-marital discussions one of those dear girls had\r\nsaid: \"We understand it thus and thus,\" or \"We hold such and such to be\r\ntrue,\" we men, in our own deep-seated convictions of the power of love,\r\nand our easy views about beliefs and principles, fondly imagined that\r\nwe could convince them otherwise. What we imagined, before marriage, did\r\nnot matter any more than what an average innocent young girl imagines.\r\nWe found the facts to be different.\r\n\r\nIt was not that they did not love us; they did, deeply and warmly. But\r\nthere are you again--what they meant by \"love\" and what we meant by\r\n\"love\" were so different.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it seems rather cold-blooded to say \"we\" and \"they,\" as if we\r\nwere not separate couples, with our separate joys and sorrows, but our\r\npositions as aliens drove us together constantly. The whole strange\r\nexperience had made our friendship more close and intimate than it would\r\never have become in a free and easy lifetime among our own people.\r\nAlso, as men, with our masculine tradition of far more than two thousand\r\nyears, we were a unit, small but firm, against this far larger unit of\r\nfeminine tradition.\r\n\r\nI think I can make clear the points of difference without a too painful\r\nexplicitness. The more external disagreement was in the matter of \"the\r\nhome,\" and the housekeeping duties and pleasures we, by instinct and\r\nlong education, supposed to be inherently appropriate to women.\r\n\r\nI will give two illustrations, one away up, and the other away down, to\r\nshow how completely disappointed we were in this regard.\r\n\r\nFor the lower one, try to imagine a male ant, coming from some state of\r\nexistence where ants live in pairs, endeavoring to set up housekeeping\r\nwith a female ant from a highly developed anthill. This female ant might\r\nregard him with intense personal affection, but her ideas of parentage\r\nand economic management would be on a very different scale from his.\r\nNow, of course, if she was a stray female in a country of pairing ants,\r\nhe might have had his way with her; but if he was a stray male in an\r\nanthill--!\r\n\r\nFor the higher one, try to imagine a devoted and impassioned man trying\r\nto set up housekeeping with a lady angel, a real wings-and-harp-and-halo\r\nangel, accustomed to fulfilling divine missions all over interstellar\r\nspace. This angel might love the man with an affection quite beyond his\r\npower of return or even of appreciation, but her ideas of service and\r\nduty would be on a very different scale from his. Of course, if she was\r\na stray angel in a country of men, he might have had his way with her;\r\nbut if he was a stray man among angels--!\r\n\r\nTerry, at his worst, in a black fury for which, as a man, I must have\r\nsome sympathy, preferred the ant simile. More of Terry and his special\r\ntroubles later. It was hard on Terry.\r\n\r\nJeff--well, Jeff always had a streak that was too good for this world!\r\nHe's the kind that would have made a saintly priest in parentagearlier\r\ntimes. He accepted the angel theory, swallowed it whole, tried to force\r\nit on us--with varying effect. He so worshipped Celis, and not only\r\nCelis, but what she represented; he had become so deeply convinced of\r\nthe almost supernatural advantages of this country and people, that he\r\ntook his medicine like a--I cannot say \"like a man,\" but more as if he\r\nwasn't one.\r\n\r\nDon't misunderstand me for a moment. Dear old Jeff was no milksop or\r\nmolly-coddle either. He was a strong, brave, efficient man, and an\r\nexcellent fighter when fighting was necessary. But there was always this\r\nangel streak in him. It was rather a wonder, Terry being so different,\r\nthat he really loved Jeff as he did; but it happens so sometimes, in\r\nspite of the difference--perhaps because of it.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I stood between. I was no such gay Lothario as Terry, and no\r\nsuch Galahad as Jeff. But for all my limitations I think I had the habit\r\nof using my brains in regard to behavior rather more frequently than\r\neither of them. I had to use brain-power now, I can tell you.\r\n\r\nThe big point at issue between us and our wives was, as may easily be\r\nimagined, in the very nature of the relation.\r\n\r\n\"Wives! Don't talk to me about wives!\" stormed Terry. \"They don't know\r\nwhat the word means.\"\r\n\r\nWhich is exactly the fact--they didn't. How could they? Back in their\r\nprehistoric records of polygamy and slavery there were no ideals of\r\nwifehood as we know it, and since then no possibility of forming such.\r\n\r\n\"The only thing they can think of about a man is FATHERHOOD!\" said Terry\r\nin high scorn. \"FATHERHOOD! As if a man was always wanting to be a\r\nFATHER!\"\r\n\r\nThis also was correct. They had their long, wide, deep, rich experience\r\nof Motherhood, and their only perception of the value of a male creature\r\nas such was for Fatherhood.\r\n\r\nAside from that, of course, was the whole range of personal love, love\r\nwhich as Jeff earnestly phrased it \"passeth the love of women!\" It did,\r\ntoo. I can give no idea--either now, after long and happy experience of\r\nit, or as it seemed then, in the first measureless wonder--of the beauty\r\nand power of the love they gave us.\r\n\r\nEven Alima--who had a more stormy temperament than either of the others,\r\nand who, heaven knows, had far more provocation--even Alima was patience\r\nand tenderness and wisdom personified to the man she loved, until\r\nhe--but I haven't got to that yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese, as Terry put it, \"alleged or so-called wives\" of ours, went right\r\non with their profession as foresters. We, having no special learnings,\r\nhad long since qualified as assistants. We had to do something, if only\r\nto pass the time, and it had to be work--we couldn't be playing forever.\r\n\r\nThis kept us out of doors with those dear girls, and more or less\r\ntogether--too much together sometimes.\r\n\r\nThese people had, it now became clear to us, the highest, keenest, most\r\ndelicate sense of personal privacy, but not the faintest idea of that\r\nSOLITUDE A DEUX we are so fond of. They had, every one of them, the \"two\r\nrooms and a bath\" theory realized. From earliest childhood each had\r\na separate bedroom with toilet conveniences, and one of the marks of\r\ncoming of age was the addition of an outer room in which to receive\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nLong since we had been given our own two rooms apiece, and as being of a\r\ndifferent sex and race, these were in a separate house. It seemed to be\r\nrecognized that we should breathe easier if able to free our minds in\r\nreal seclusion.\r\n\r\nFor food we either went to any convenient eating-house, ordered a meal\r\nbrought in, or took it with us to the woods, always and equally good.\r\nAll this we had become used to and enjoyed--in our courting days.\r\n\r\nAfter marriage there arose in us a somewhat unexpected urge of feeling\r\nthat called for a separate house; but this feeling found no response in\r\nthe hearts of those fair ladies.\r\n\r\n\"We ARE alone, dear,\" Ellador explained to me with gentle patience.\r\n\"We are alone in these great forests; we may go and eat in any little\r\nsummer-house--just we two, or have a separate table anywhere--or even\r\nhave a separate meal in our own rooms. How could we be aloner?\"\r\n\r\nThis was all very true. We had our pleasant mutual solitude about our\r\nwork, and our pleasant evening talks in their apartments or ours; we\r\nhad, as it were, all the pleasures of courtship carried right on; but we\r\nhad no sense of--perhaps it may be called possession.\r\n\r\n\"Might as well not be married at all,\" growled Terry. \"They only got up\r\nthat ceremony to please us--please Jeff, mostly. They've no real idea of\r\nbeing married.\"\r\n\r\nI tried my best to get Ellador's point of view, and naturally I tried to\r\ngive her mine. Of course, what we, as men, wanted to make them see was\r\nthat there were other, and as we proudly said \"higher,\" uses in this\r\nrelation than what Terry called \"mere parentage.\" In the highest terms I\r\nknew I tried to explain this to Ellador.\r\n\r\n\"Anything higher than for mutual love to hope to give life, as we did?\"\r\nshe said. \"How is it higher?\"\r\n\r\n\"It develops love,\" I explained. \"All the power of beautiful permanent\r\nmated love comes through this higher development.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure?\" she asked gently. \"How do you know that it was so\r\ndeveloped? There are some birds who love each other so that they mope\r\nand pine if separated, and never pair again if one dies, but they never\r\nmate except in the mating season. Among your people do you find high and\r\nlasting affection appearing in proportion to this indulgence?\"\r\n\r\nIt is a very awkward thing, sometimes, to have a logical mind.\r\n\r\nOf course I knew about those monogamous birds and beasts too, that mate\r\nfor life and show every sign of mutual affection, without ever having\r\nstretched the sex relationship beyond its original range. But what of\r\nit?\r\n\r\n\"Those are lower forms of life!\" I protested. \"They have no capacity\r\nfor faithful and affectionate, and apparently happy--but oh, my dear! my\r\ndear!--what can they know of such a love as draws us together? Why, to\r\ntouch you--to be near you--to come closer and closer--to lose myself in\r\nyou--surely you feel it too, do you not?\"\r\n\r\nI came nearer. I seized her hands.\r\n\r\nHer eyes were on mine, tender radiant, but steady and strong. There was\r\nsomething so powerful, so large and changeless, in those eyes that\r\nI could not sweep her off her feet by my own emotion as I had\r\nunconsciously assumed would be the case.\r\n\r\nIt made me feel as, one might imagine, a man might feel who loved a\r\ngoddess--not a Venus, though! She did not resent my attitude, did not\r\nrepel it, did not in the least fear it, evidently. There was not a shade\r\nof that timid withdrawal or pretty resistance which are so--provocative.\r\n\r\n\"You see, dearest,\" she said, \"you have to be patient with us. We are\r\nnot like the women of your country. We are Mothers, and we are People,\r\nbut we have not specialized in this line.\"\r\n\r\n\"We\" and \"we\" and \"we\"--it was so hard to get her to be personal. And,\r\nas I thought that, I suddenly remembered how we were always criticizing\r\nOUR women for BEING so personal.\r\n\r\nThen I did my earnest best to picture to her the sweet intense joy of\r\nmarried lovers, and the result in higher stimulus to all creative work.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean,\" she asked quite calmly, as if I was not holding her cool\r\nfirm hands in my hot and rather quivering ones, \"that with you, when\r\npeople marry, they go right on doing this in season and out of season,\r\nwith no thought of children at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"They do,\" I said, with some bitterness. \"They are not mere parents.\r\nThey are men and women, and they love each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long?\" asked Ellador, rather unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n\"How long?\" I repeated, a little dashed. \"Why as long as they live.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is something very beautiful in the idea,\" she admitted, still as\r\nif she were discussing life on Mars. \"This climactic expression, which,\r\nin all the other life-forms, has but the one purpose, has with you\r\nbecome specialized to higher, purer, nobler uses. It has--I judge from\r\nwhat you tell me--the most ennobling effect on character. People marry,\r\nnot only for parentage, but for this exquisite interchange--and, as\r\na result, you have a world full of continuous lovers, ardent, happy,\r\nmutually devoted, always living on that high tide of supreme emotion\r\nwhich we had supposed to belong only to one season and one use. And you\r\nsay it has other results, stimulating all high creative work. That must\r\nmean floods, oceans of such work, blossoming from this intense happiness\r\nof every married pair! It is a beautiful idea!\"\r\n\r\nShe was silent, thinking.\r\n\r\nSo was I.\r\n\r\nShe slipped one hand free, and was stroking my hair with it in a gentle\r\nmotherly way. I bowed my hot head on her shoulder and felt a dim sense\r\nof peace, a restfulness which was very pleasant.\r\n\r\n\"You must take me there someday, darling,\" she was saying. \"It is\r\nnot only that I love you so much, I want to see your country--your\r\npeople--your mother--\" she paused reverently. \"Oh, how I shall love your\r\nmother!\"\r\n\r\nI had not been in love many times--my experience did not compare\r\nwith Terry's. But such as I had was so different from this that I was\r\nperplexed, and full of mixed feelings: partly a growing sense of common\r\nground between us, a pleasant rested calm feeling, which I had imagined\r\ncould only be attained in one way; and partly a bewildered resentment\r\nbecause what I found was not what I had looked for.\r\n\r\nIt was their confounded psychology! Here they were with this profound\r\nhighly developed system of education so bred into them that even if they\r\nwere not teachers by profession they all had a general proficiency in\r\nit--it was second nature to them.\r\n\r\nAnd no child, stormily demanding a cookie \"between meals,\" was ever more\r\nsubtly diverted into an interest in house-building than was I when\r\nI found an apparently imperative demand had disappeared without my\r\nnoticing it.\r\n\r\nAnd all the time those tender mother eyes, those keen scientific eyes,\r\nnoting every condition and circumstance, and learning how to \"take time\r\nby the forelock\" and avoid discussion before occasion arose.\r\n\r\nI was amazed at the results. I found that much, very much, of what I had\r\nhonestly supposed to be a physiological necessity was a psychological\r\nnecessity--or so believed. I found, after my ideas of what was essential\r\nhad changed, that my feelings changed also. And more than all, I found\r\nthis--a factor of enormous weight--these women were not provocative.\r\nThat made an immense difference.\r\n\r\nThe thing that Terry had so complained of when we first came--that they\r\nweren't \"feminine,\" they lacked \"charm,\" now became a great comfort.\r\nTheir vigorous beauty was an aesthetic pleasure, not an irritant. Their\r\ndress and ornaments had not a touch of the \"come-and-find-me\" element.\r\n\r\nEven with my own Ellador, my wife, who had for a time unveiled a woman's\r\nheart and faced the strange new hope and joy of dual parentage, she\r\nafterward withdrew again into the same good comrade she had been at\r\nfirst. They were women, PLUS, and so much plus that when they did not\r\nchoose to let the womanness appear, you could not find it anywhere.\r\n\r\nI don't say it was easy for me; it wasn't. But when I made appeal to\r\nher sympathies I came up against another immovable wall. She was sorry,\r\nhonestly sorry, for my distresses, and made all manner of thoughtful\r\nsuggestions, often quite useful, as well as the wise foresight I have\r\nmentioned above, which often saved all difficulty before it arose; but\r\nher sympathy did not alter her convictions.\r\n\r\n\"If I thought it was really right and necessary, I could perhaps bring\r\nmyself to it, for your sake, dear; but I do not want to--not at all.\r\nYou would not have a mere submission, would you? That is not the kind of\r\nhigh romantic love you spoke of, surely? It is a pity, of course, that\r\nyou should have to adjust your highly specialized faculties to our\r\nunspecialized ones.\"\r\n\r\nConfound it! I hadn't married the nation, and I told her so. But she\r\nonly smiled at her own limitations and explained that she had to \"think\r\nin we's.\"\r\n\r\nConfound it again! Here I'd have all my energies focused on one wish,\r\nand before I knew it she'd have them dissipated in one direction or\r\nanother, some subject of discussion that began just at the point I was\r\ntalking about and ended miles away.\r\n\r\nIt must not be imagined that I was just repelled, ignored, left to\r\ncherish a grievance. Not at all. My happiness was in the hands of a\r\nlarger, sweeter womanhood than I had ever imagined. Before our marriage\r\nmy own ardor had perhaps blinded me to much of this. I was madly in love\r\nwith not so much what was there as with what I supposed to be there. Now\r\nI found an endlessly beautiful undiscovered country to explore, and in\r\nit the sweetest wisdom and understanding. It was as if I had come to\r\nsome new place and people, with a desire to eat at all hours, and no\r\nother interests in particular; and as if my hosts, instead of merely\r\nsaying, \"You shall not eat,\" had presently aroused in me a lively desire\r\nfor music, for pictures, for games, for exercise, for playing in the\r\nwater, for running some ingenious machine; and, in the multitude of my\r\nsatisfactions, I forgot the one point which was not satisfied, and got\r\nalong very well until mealtime.\r\n\r\nOne of the cleverest and most ingenious of these tricks was only clear\r\nto me many years after, when we were so wholly at one on this subject\r\nthat I could laugh at my own predicament then. It was this: You see,\r\nwith us, women are kept as different as possible and as feminine as\r\npossible. We men have our own world, with only men in it; we get tired\r\nof our ultra-maleness and turn gladly to the ultra-femaleness. Also,\r\nin keeping our women as feminine as possible, we see to it that when\r\nwe turn to them we find the thing we want always in evidence. Well, the\r\natmosphere of this place was anything but seductive. The very numbers\r\nof these human women, always in human relation, made them anything\r\nbut alluring. When, in spite of this, my hereditary instincts and\r\nrace-traditions made me long for the feminine response in Ellador,\r\ninstead of withdrawing so that I should want her more, she deliberately\r\ngave me a little too much of her society.--always de-feminized, as it\r\nwere. It was awfully funny, really.\r\n\r\nHere was I, with an Ideal in mind, for which I hotly longed, and here\r\nwas she, deliberately obtruding in the foreground of my consciousness a\r\nFact--a fact which I coolly enjoyed, but which actually interfered with\r\nwhat I wanted. I see now clearly enough why a certain kind of man, like\r\nSir Almroth Wright, resents the professional development of women. It\r\ngets in the way of the sex ideal; it temporarily covers and excludes\r\nfemininity.\r\n\r\nOf course, in this case, I was so fond of Ellador my friend, of Ellador\r\nmy professional companion, that I necessarily enjoyed her society on any\r\nterms. Only--when I had had her with me in her de-feminine capacity for\r\na sixteen-hour day, I could go to my own room and sleep without dreaming\r\nabout her.\r\n\r\nThe witch! If ever anybody worked to woo and win and hold a human soul,\r\nshe did, great superwoman that she was. I couldn't then half comprehend\r\nthe skill of it, the wonder. But this I soon began to find: that under\r\nall our cultivated attitude of mind toward women, there is an older,\r\ndeeper, more \"natural\" feeling, the restful reverence which looks up to\r\nthe Mother sex.\r\n\r\nSo we grew together in friendship and happiness, Ellador and I, and so\r\ndid Jeff and Celis.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to Terry's part of it, and Alima's, I'm sorry--and\r\nI'm ashamed. Of course I blame her somewhat. She wasn't as fine\r\na psychologist as Ellador, and what's more, I think she had a\r\nfar-descended atavistic trace of more marked femaleness, never apparent\r\ntill Terry called it out. But when all is said, it doesn't excuse him. I\r\nhadn't realized to the full Terry's character--I couldn't, being a man.\r\n\r\nThe position was the same as with us, of course, only with these\r\ndistinctions. Alima, a shade more alluring, and several shades less able\r\nas a practical psychologist; Terry, a hundredfold more demanding--and\r\nproportionately less reasonable.\r\n\r\nThings grew strained very soon between them. I fancy at first, when\r\nthey were together, in her great hope of parentage and his keen joy of\r\nconquest--that Terry was inconsiderate. In fact, I know it, from things\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n\"You needn't talk to me,\" he snapped at Jeff one day, just before\r\nour weddings. \"There never was a woman yet that did not enjoy being\r\nMASTERED. All your pretty talk doesn't amount to a hill o'beans--I\r\nKNOW.\" And Terry would hum:\r\n\r\n    I've taken my fun where I found it.\r\n    I've rogued and I've ranged in my time,\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n    The things that I learned from the yellow and black,\r\n    They 'ave helped me a 'eap with the white.\r\n\r\nJeff turned sharply and left him at the time. I was a bit disquieted\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nPoor old Terry! The things he'd learned didn't help him a heap in\r\nHerland. His idea was to take--he thought that was the way. He thought,\r\nhe honestly believed, that women like it. Not the women of Herland! Not\r\nAlima!\r\n\r\nI can see her now--one day in the very first week of their marriage,\r\nsetting forth to her day's work with long determined strides and\r\nhard-set mouth, and sticking close to Ellador. She didn't wish to be\r\nalone with Terry--you could see that.\r\n\r\nBut the more she kept away from him, the more he wanted her--naturally.\r\n\r\nHe made a tremendous row about their separate establishments, tried to\r\nkeep her in his rooms, tried to stay in hers. But there she drew the\r\nline sharply.\r\n\r\nHe came away one night, and stamped up and down the moonlit road,\r\nswearing under his breath. I was taking a walk that night too, but I\r\nwasn't in his state of mind. To hear him rage you'd not have believed\r\nthat he loved Alima at all--you'd have thought that she was some quarry\r\nhe was pursuing, something to catch and conquer.\r\n\r\nI think that, owing to all those differences I spoke of, they soon lost\r\nthe common ground they had at first, and were unable to meet sanely\r\nand dispassionately. I fancy too--this is pure conjecture--that he\r\nhad succeeded in driving Alima beyond her best judgment, her real\r\nconscience, and that after that her own sense of shame, the reaction of\r\nthe thing, made her bitter perhaps.\r\n\r\nThey quarreled, really quarreled, and after making it up once or twice,\r\nthey seemed to come to a real break--she would not be alone with him\r\nat all. And perhaps she was a bit nervous, I don't know, but she got\r\nMoadine to come and stay next door to her. Also, she had a sturdy\r\nassistant detailed to accompany her in her work.\r\n\r\nTerry had his own ideas, as I've tried to show. I daresay he thought he\r\nhad a right to do as he did. Perhaps he even convinced himself that\r\nit would be better for her. Anyhow, he hid himself in her bedroom one\r\nnight...\r\n\r\nThe women of Herland have no fear of men. Why should they have? They\r\nare not timid in any sense. They are not weak; and they all have strong\r\ntrained athletic bodies. Othello could not have extinguished Alima with\r\na pillow, as if she were a mouse.\r\n\r\nTerry put in practice his pet conviction that a woman loves to be\r\nmastered, and by sheer brute force, in all the pride and passion of his\r\nintense masculinity, he tried to master this woman.\r\n\r\nIt did not work. I got a pretty clear account of it later from Ellador,\r\nbut what we heard at the time was the noise of a tremendous struggle,\r\nand Alima calling to Moadine. Moadine was close by and came at once; one\r\nor two more strong grave women followed.\r\n\r\nTerry dashed about like a madman; he would cheerfully have killed\r\nthem--he told me that, himself--but he couldn't. When he swung a chair\r\nover his head one sprang in the air and caught it, two threw themselves\r\nbodily upon him and forced him to the floor; it was only the work of a\r\nfew moments to have him tied hand and foot, and then, in sheer pity for\r\nhis futile rage, to anesthetize him.\r\n\r\nAlima was in a cold fury. She wanted him killed--actually.\r\n\r\nThere was a trial before the local Over Mother, and this woman, who did\r\nnot enjoy being mastered, stated her case.\r\n\r\nIn a court in our country he would have been held quite \"within his\r\nrights,\" of course. But this was not our country; it was theirs. They\r\nseemed to measure the enormity of the offense by its effect upon a\r\npossible fatherhood, and he scorned even to reply to this way of putting\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe did let himself go once, and explained in definite terms that they\r\nwere incapable of understanding a man's needs, a man's desires, a man's\r\npoint of view. He called them neuters, epicenes, bloodless, sexless\r\ncreatures. He said they could of course kill him--as so many insects\r\ncould--but that he despised them nonetheless.\r\n\r\nAnd all those stern grave mothers did not seem to mind his despising\r\nthem, not in the least.\r\n\r\nIt was a long trial, and many interesting points were brought out as to\r\ntheir views of our habits, and after a while Terry had his sentence. He\r\nwaited, grim and defiant. The sentence was: \"You must go home!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12. Expelled\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had all meant to go home again. Indeed we had NOT meant--not by any\r\nmeans--to stay as long as we had. But when it came to being turned out,\r\ndismissed, sent away for bad conduct, we none of us really liked it.\r\n\r\nTerry said he did. He professed great scorn of the penalty and the\r\ntrial, as well as all the other characteristics of \"this miserable\r\nhalf-country.\" But he knew, and we knew, that in any \"whole\" country we\r\nshould never have been as forgivingly treated as we had been here.\r\n\r\n\"If the people had come after us according to the directions we left,\r\nthere'd have been quite a different story!\" said Terry. We found out\r\nlater why no reserve party had arrived. All our careful directions had\r\nbeen destroyed in a fire. We might have all died there and no one at\r\nhome have ever known our whereabouts.\r\n\r\nTerry was under guard now, all the time, known as unsafe, convicted of\r\nwhat was to them an unpardonable sin.\r\n\r\nHe laughed at their chill horror. \"Parcel of old maids!\" he called them.\r\n\"They're all old maids--children or not. They don't know the first thing\r\nabout Sex.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Terry said SEX, sex with a very large _S_, he meant the male sex,\r\nnaturally; its special values, its profound conviction of being \"the\r\nlife force,\" its cheerful ignoring of the true life process, and its\r\ninterpretation of the other sex solely from its own point of view.\r\n\r\nI had learned to see these things very differently since living with\r\nEllador; and as for Jeff, he was so thoroughly Herlandized that he\r\nwasn't fair to Terry, who fretted sharply in his new restraint.\r\n\r\nMoadine, grave and strong, as sadly patient as a mother with a\r\ndegenerate child, kept steady watch on him, with enough other women\r\nclose at hand to prevent an outbreak. He had no weapons, and well knew\r\nthat all his strength was of small avail against those grim, quiet\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nWe were allowed to visit him freely, but he had only his room, and a\r\nsmall high-walled garden to walk in, while the preparations for our\r\ndeparture were under way.\r\n\r\nThree of us were to go: Terry, because he must; I, because two were\r\nsafer for our flyer, and the long boat trip to the coast; Ellador,\r\nbecause she would not let me go without her.\r\n\r\nIf Jeff had elected to return, Celis would have gone too--they were the\r\nmost absorbed of lovers; but Jeff had no desire that way.\r\n\r\n\"Why should I want to go back to all our noise and dirt, our vice and\r\ncrime, our disease and degeneracy?\" he demanded of me privately. We\r\nnever spoke like that before the women. \"I wouldn't take Celis there for\r\nanything on earth!\" he protested. \"She'd die! She'd die of horror and\r\nshame to see our slums and hospitals. How can you risk it with Ellador?\r\nYou'd better break it to her gently before she really makes up her\r\nmind.\"\r\n\r\nJeff was right. I ought to have told her more fully than I did, of all\r\nthe things we had to be ashamed of. But it is very hard to bridge the\r\ngulf of as deep a difference as existed between our life and theirs. I\r\ntried to.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, my dear,\" I said to her. \"If you are really going to my\r\ncountry with me, you've got to be prepared for a good many shocks. It's\r\nnot as beautiful as this--the cities, I mean, the civilized parts--of\r\ncourse the wild country is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall enjoy it all,\" she said, her eyes starry with hope. \"I\r\nunderstand it's not like ours. I can see how monotonous our quiet life\r\nmust seem to you, how much more stirring yours must be. It must be\r\nlike the biological change you told me about when the second sex\r\nwas introduced--a far greater movement, constant change, with new\r\npossibilities of growth.\"\r\n\r\nI had told her of the later biological theories of sex, and she\r\nwas deeply convinced of the superior advantages of having two, the\r\nsuperiority of a world with men in it.\r\n\r\n\"We have done what we could alone; perhaps we have some things better\r\nin a quiet way, but you have the whole world--all the people of the\r\ndifferent nations--all the long rich history behind you--all the\r\nwonderful new knowledge. Oh, I just can't wait to see it!\"\r\n\r\nWhat could I do? I told her in so many words that we had our unsolved\r\nproblems, that we had dishonesty and corruption, vice and crime, disease\r\nand insanity, prisons and hospitals; and it made no more impression on\r\nher than it would to tell a South Sea Islander about the temperature of\r\nthe Arctic Circle. She could intellectually see that it was bad to have\r\nthose things; but she could not FEEL it.\r\n\r\nWe had quite easily come to accept the Herland life as normal, because\r\nit was normal--none of us make any outcry over mere health and peace\r\nand happy industry. And the abnormal, to which we are all so sadly well\r\nacclimated, she had never seen.\r\n\r\nThe two things she cared most to hear about, and wanted most to see,\r\nwere these: the beautiful relation of marriage and the lovely women\r\nwho were mothers and nothing else; beyond these her keen, active mind\r\nhungered eagerly for the world life.\r\n\r\n\"I'm almost as anxious to go as you are yourself,\" she insisted, \"and\r\nyou must be desperately homesick.\"\r\n\r\nI assured her that no one could be homesick in such a paradise as\r\ntheirs, but she would have none of it.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes--I know. It's like those little tropical islands you've told me\r\nabout, shining like jewels in the big blue sea--I can't wait to see the\r\nsea! The little island may be as perfect as a garden, but you always\r\nwant to get back to your own big country, don't you? Even if it is bad\r\nin some ways?\"\r\n\r\nEllador was more than willing. But the nearer it came to our really\r\ngoing, and to my having to take her back to our \"civilization,\" after\r\nthe clean peace and beauty of theirs, the more I began to dread it, and\r\nthe more I tried to explain.\r\n\r\nOf course I had been homesick at first, while we were prisoners, before\r\nI had Ellador. And of course I had, at first, rather idealized my\r\ncountry and its ways, in describing it. Also, I had always accepted\r\ncertain evils as integral parts of our civilization and never dwelt on\r\nthem at all. Even when I tried to tell her the worst, I never remembered\r\nsome things--which, when she came to see them, impressed her at once, as\r\nthey had never impressed me. Now, in my efforts at explanation, I began\r\nto see both ways more keenly than I had before; to see the painful\r\ndefects of my own land, the marvelous gains of this.\r\n\r\nIn missing men we three visitors had naturally missed the larger part of\r\nlife, and had unconsciously assumed that they must miss it too. It took\r\nme a long time to realize--Terry never did realize--how little it\r\nmeant to them. When we say MEN, MAN, MANLY, MANHOOD, and all the other\r\nmasculine derivatives, we have in the background of our minds a huge\r\nvague crowded picture of the world and all its activities. To grow up\r\nand \"be a man,\" to \"act like a man\"--the meaning and connotation is\r\nwide indeed. That vast background is full of marching columns of men, of\r\nchanging lines of men, of long processions of men; of men steering\r\ntheir ships into new seas, exploring unknown mountains, breaking horses,\r\nherding cattle, ploughing and sowing and reaping, toiling at the forge\r\nand furnace, digging in the mine, building roads and bridges and high\r\ncathedrals, managing great businesses, teaching in all the colleges,\r\npreaching in all the churches; of men everywhere, doing everything--\"the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when we say WOMEN, we think FEMALE--the sex.\r\n\r\nBut to these women, in the unbroken sweep of this two-thousand-year-old\r\nfeminine civilization, the word WOMAN called up all that big background,\r\nso far as they had gone in social development; and the word MAN meant to\r\nthem only MALE--the sex.\r\n\r\nOf course we could TELL them that in our world men did everything; but\r\nthat did not alter the background of their minds. That man, \"the male,\"\r\ndid all these things was to them a statement, making no more change\r\nin the point of view than was made in ours when we first faced the\r\nastounding fact--to us--that in Herland women were \"the world.\"\r\n\r\nWe had been living there more than a year. We had learned their limited\r\nhistory, with its straight, smooth, upreaching lines, reaching higher\r\nand going faster up to the smooth comfort of their present life. We\r\nhad learned a little of their psychology, a much wider field than the\r\nhistory, but here we could not follow so readily. We were now well used\r\nto seeing women not as females but as people; people of all sorts, doing\r\nevery kind of work.\r\n\r\nThis outbreak of Terry's, and the strong reaction against it, gave us\r\na new light on their genuine femininity. This was given me with great\r\nclearness by both Ellador and Somel. The feeling was the same--sick\r\nrevulsion and horror, such as would be felt at some climactic blasphemy.\r\n\r\nThey had no faintest approach to such a thing in their minds, knowing\r\nnothing of the custom of marital indulgence among us. To them the one\r\nhigh purpose of motherhood had been for so long the governing law of\r\nlife, and the contribution of the father, though known to them, so\r\ndistinctly another method to the same end, that they could not, with all\r\ntheir effort, get the point of view of the male creature whose desires\r\nquite ignore parentage and seek only for what we euphoniously term \"the\r\njoys of love.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I tried to tell Ellador that women too felt so, with us, she drew\r\naway from me, and tried hard to grasp intellectually what she could in\r\nno way sympathize with.\r\n\r\n\"You mean--that with you--love between man and woman expresses itself in\r\nthat way--without regard to motherhood? To parentage, I mean,\" she added\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, surely. It is love we think of--the deep sweet love between two.\r\nOf course we want children, and children come--but that is not what we\r\nthink about.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--but--it seems so against nature!\" she said. \"None of the creatures\r\nwe know do that. Do other animals--in your country?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are not animals!\" I replied with some sharpness. \"At least we\r\nare something more--something higher. This is a far nobler and more\r\nbeautiful relation, as I have explained before. Your view seems to us\r\nrather--shall I say, practical? Prosaic? Merely a means to an end! With\r\nus--oh, my dear girl--cannot you see? Cannot you feel? It is the last,\r\nsweetest, highest consummation of mutual love.\"\r\n\r\nShe was impressed visibly. She trembled in my arms, as I held her close,\r\nkissing her hungrily. But there rose in her eyes that look I knew so\r\nwell, that remote clear look as if she had gone far away even though\r\nI held her beautiful body so close, and was now on some snowy mountain\r\nregarding me from a distance.\r\n\r\n\"I feel it quite clearly,\" she said to me. \"It gives me a deep sympathy\r\nwith what you feel, no doubt more strongly still. But what I feel, even\r\nwhat you feel, dearest, does not convince me that it is right. Until I\r\nam sure of that, of course I cannot do as you wish.\"\r\n\r\nEllador, at times like this, always reminded me of Epictetus. \"I will\r\nput you in prison!\" said his master. \"My body, you mean,\" replied\r\nEpictetus calmly. \"I will cut your head off,\" said his master. \"Have I\r\nsaid that my head could not be cut off?\" A difficult person, Epictetus.\r\n\r\nWhat is this miracle by which a woman, even in your arms, may withdraw\r\nherself, utterly disappear till what you hold is as inaccessible as the\r\nface of a cliff?\r\n\r\n\"Be patient with me, dear,\" she urged sweetly. \"I know it is hard for\r\nyou. And I begin to see--a little--how Terry was so driven to crime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come, that's a pretty hard word for it. After all, Alima was\r\nhis wife, you know,\" I urged, feeling at the moment a sudden burst of\r\nsympathy for poor Terry. For a man of his temperament--and habits--it\r\nmust have been an unbearable situation.\r\n\r\nBut Ellador, for all her wide intellectual grasp, and the broad sympathy\r\nin which their religion trained them, could not make allowance for\r\nsuch--to her--sacrilegious brutality.\r\n\r\nIt was the more difficult to explain to her, because we three, in our\r\nconstant talks and lectures about the rest of the world, had naturally\r\navoided the seamy side; not so much from a desire to deceive, but from\r\nwishing to put the best foot foremost for our civilization, in the face\r\nof the beauty and comfort of theirs. Also, we really thought some things\r\nwere right, or at least unavoidable, which we could readily see would be\r\nrepugnant to them, and therefore did not discuss. Again there was much\r\nof our world's life which we, being used to it, had not noticed as\r\nanything worth describing. And still further, there was about these\r\nwomen a colossal innocence upon which many of the things we did say had\r\nmade no impression whatever.\r\n\r\nI am thus explicit about it because it shows how unexpectedly strong\r\nwas the impression made upon Ellador when she at last entered our\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nShe urged me to be patient, and I was patient. You see, I loved her so\r\nmuch that even the restrictions she so firmly established left me much\r\nhappiness. We were lovers, and there is surely delight enough in that.\r\n\r\nDo not imagine that these young women utterly refused \"the Great New\r\nHope,\" as they called it, that of dual parentage. For that they had\r\nagreed to marry us, though the marrying part of it was a concession\r\nto our prejudices rather than theirs. To them the process was the holy\r\nthing--and they meant to keep it holy.\r\n\r\nBut so far only Celis, her blue eyes swimming in happy tears, her\r\nheart lifted with that tide of race-motherhood which was their supreme\r\npassion, could with ineffable joy and pride announce that she was to\r\nbe a mother. \"The New Motherhood\" they called it, and the whole country\r\nknew. There was no pleasure, no service, no honor in all the land that\r\nCelis might not have had. Almost like the breathless reverence with\r\nwhich, two thousand years ago, that dwindling band of women had watched\r\nthe miracle of virgin birth, was the deep awe and warm expectancy with\r\nwhich they greeted this new miracle of union.\r\n\r\nAll mothers in that land were holy. To them, for long ages, the approach\r\nto motherhood has been by the most intense and exquisite love and\r\nlonging, by the Supreme Desire, the overmastering demand for a child.\r\nEvery thought they held in connection with the processes of maternity\r\nwas open to the day, simple yet sacred. Every woman of them placed\r\nmotherhood not only higher than other duties, but so far higher that\r\nthere were no other duties, one might almost say. All their wide mutual\r\nlove, all the subtle interplay of mutual friendship and service,\r\nthe urge of progressive thought and invention, the deepest religious\r\nemotion, every feeling and every act was related to this great central\r\nPower, to the River of Life pouring through them, which made them the\r\nbearers of the very Spirit of God.\r\n\r\nOf all this I learned more and more--from their books, from talk,\r\nespecially from Ellador. She was at first, for a brief moment, envious\r\nof her friend--a thought she put away from her at once and forever.\r\n\r\n\"It is better,\" she said to me. \"It is much better that it has not come\r\nto me yet--to us, that is. For if I am to go with you to your country,\r\nwe may have 'adventures by sea and land,' as you say [and as in truth we\r\ndid], and it might not be at all safe for a baby. So we won't try again,\r\ndear, till it is safe--will we?\"\r\n\r\nThis was a hard saying for a very loving husband.\r\n\r\n\"Unless,\" she went on, \"if one is coming, you will leave me behind. You\r\ncan come back, you know--and I shall have the child.\"\r\n\r\nThen that deep ancient chill of male jealousy of even his own progeny\r\ntouched my heart.\r\n\r\n\"I'd rather have you, Ellador, than all the children in the world. I'd\r\nrather have you with me--on your own terms--than not to have you.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a very stupid saying. Of course I would! For if she wasn't\r\nthere I should want all of her and have none of her. But if she went\r\nalong as a sort of sublimated sister--only much closer and warmer than\r\nthat, really--why I should have all of her but that one thing. And I\r\nwas beginning to find that Ellador's friendship, Ellador's comradeship,\r\nEllador's sisterly affection, Ellador's perfectly sincere love--none\r\nthe less deep that she held it back on a definite line of reserve--were\r\nenough to live on very happily.\r\n\r\nI find it quite beyond me to describe what this woman was to me. We talk\r\nfine things about women, but in our hearts we know that they are very\r\nlimited beings--most of them. We honor them for their functional powers,\r\neven while we dishonor them by our use of it; we honor them for their\r\ncarefully enforced virtue, even while we show by our own conduct how\r\nlittle we think of that virtue; we value them, sincerely, for the\r\nperverted maternal activities which make our wives the most comfortable\r\nof servants, bound to us for life with the wages wholly at our own\r\ndecision, their whole business, outside of the temporary duties of such\r\nmotherhood as they may achieve, to meet our needs in every way. Oh, we\r\nvalue them, all right, \"in their place,\" which place is the home, where\r\nthey perform that mixture of duties so ably described by Mrs. Josephine\r\nDodge Daskam Bacon, in which the services of \"a mistress\" are carefully\r\nspecified. She is a very clear writer, Mrs. J. D. D. Bacon, and\r\nunderstands her subject--from her own point of view. But--that\r\ncombination of industries, while convenient, and in a way economical,\r\ndoes not arouse the kind of emotion commanded by the women of Herland.\r\nThese were women one had to love \"up,\" very high up, instead of down.\r\nThey were not pets. They were not servants. They were not timid,\r\ninexperienced, weak.\r\n\r\nAfter I got over the jar to my pride (which Jeff, I truly think, never\r\nfelt--he was a born worshipper, and which Terry never got over--he\r\nwas quite clear in his ideas of \"the position of women\"), I found that\r\nloving \"up\" was a very good sensation after all. It gave me a queer\r\nfeeling, way down deep, as of the stirring of some ancient dim\r\nprehistoric consciousness, a feeling that they were right somehow--that\r\nthis was the way to feel. It was like--coming home to mother. I don't\r\nmean the underflannels-and-doughnuts mother, the fussy person that waits\r\non you and spoils you and doesn't really know you. I mean the feeling\r\nthat a very little child would have, who had been lost--for ever so\r\nlong. It was a sense of getting home; of being clean and rested;\r\nof safety and yet freedom; of love that was always there, warm like\r\nsunshine in May, not hot like a stove or a featherbed--a love that\r\ndidn't irritate and didn't smother.\r\n\r\nI looked at Ellador as if I hadn't seen her before. \"If you won't go,\"\r\nI said, \"I'll get Terry to the coast and come back alone. You can let me\r\ndown a rope. And if you will go--why you blessed wonder-woman--I would\r\nrather live with you all my life--like this--than to have any other\r\nwoman I ever saw, or any number of them, to do as I like with. Will you\r\ncome?\"\r\n\r\nShe was keen for coming. So the plans went on. She'd have liked to wait\r\nfor that Marvel of Celis's, but Terry had no such desire. He was crazy\r\nto be out of it all. It made him sick, he said, SICK; this everlasting\r\nmother-mother-mothering. I don't think Terry had what the phrenologists\r\ncall \"the lump of philoprogenitiveness\" at all well developed.\r\n\r\n\"Morbid one-sided cripples,\" he called them, even when from his window\r\nhe could see their splendid vigor and beauty; even while Moadine, as\r\npatient and friendly as if she had never helped Alima to hold and bind\r\nhim, sat there in the room, the picture of wisdom and serene strength.\r\n\"Sexless, epicene, undeveloped neuters!\" he went on bitterly. He sounded\r\nlike Sir Almwroth Wright.\r\n\r\nWell--it was hard. He was madly in love with Alima, really; more so than\r\nhe had ever been before, and their tempestuous courtship, quarrels, and\r\nreconciliations had fanned the flame. And then when he sought by that\r\nsupreme conquest which seems so natural a thing to that type of man, to\r\nforce her to love him as her master--to have the sturdy athletic furious\r\nwoman rise up and master him--she and her friends--it was no wonder he\r\nraged.\r\n\r\nCome to think of it, I do not recall a similar case in all history or\r\nfiction. Women have killed themselves rather than submit to outrage;\r\nthey have killed the outrager; they have escaped; or they have\r\nsubmitted--sometimes seeming to get on very well with the victor\r\nafterward. There was that adventure of \"false Sextus,\" for instance,\r\nwho \"found Lucrese combing the fleece, under the midnight lamp.\" He\r\nthreatened, as I remember, that if she did not submit he would slay her,\r\nslay a slave and place him beside her and say he found him there. A poor\r\ndevice, it always seemed to me. If Mr. Lucretius had asked him how he\r\ncame to be in his wife's bedroom overlooking her morals, what could he\r\nhave said? But the point is Lucrese submitted, and Alima didn't.\r\n\r\n\"She kicked me,\" confided the embittered prisoner--he had to talk to\r\nsomeone. \"I was doubled up with the pain, of course, and she jumped on\r\nme and yelled for this old harpy [Moadine couldn't hear him] and they\r\nhad me trussed up in no time. I believe Alima could have done it alone,\"\r\nhe added with reluctant admiration. \"She's as strong as a horse. And\r\nof course a man's helpless when you hit him like that. No woman with a\r\nshade of decency--\"\r\n\r\nI had to grin at that, and even Terry did, sourly. He wasn't given to\r\nreasoning, but it did strike him that an assault like his rather waived\r\nconsiderations of decency.\r\n\r\n\"I'd give a year of my life to have her alone again,\" he said slowly,\r\nhis hands clenched till the knuckles were white.\r\n\r\nBut he never did. She left our end of the country entirely, went up into\r\nthe fir-forest on the highest slopes, and stayed there. Before we left\r\nhe quite desperately longed to see her, but she would not come and he\r\ncould not go. They watched him like lynxes. (Do lynxes watch any better\r\nthan mousing cats, I wonder!)\r\n\r\nWell--we had to get the flyer in order, and be sure there was enough\r\nfuel left, though Terry said we could glide all right, down to that\r\nlake, once we got started. We'd have gone gladly in a week's time, of\r\ncourse, but there was a great to-do all over the country about\r\nEllador's leaving them. She had interviews with some of the leading\r\nethicists--wise women with still eyes, and with the best of the\r\nteachers. There was a stir, a thrill, a deep excitement everywhere.\r\n\r\nOur teaching about the rest of the world has given them all a sense\r\nof isolation, of remoteness, of being a little outlying sample of a\r\ncountry, overlooked and forgotten among the family of nations. We had\r\ncalled it \"the family of nations,\" and they liked the phrase immensely.\r\n\r\nThey were deeply aroused on the subject of evolution; indeed, the whole\r\nfield of natural science drew them irresistibly. Any number of them\r\nwould have risked everything to go to the strange unknown lands and\r\nstudy; but we could take only one, and it had to be Ellador, naturally.\r\n\r\nWe planned greatly about coming back, about establishing a connecting\r\nroute by water; about penetrating those vast forests and civilizing--or\r\nexterminating--the dangerous savages. That is, we men talked of that\r\nlast--not with the women. They had a definite aversion to killing\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile there was high council being held among the wisest of them\r\nall. The students and thinkers who had been gathering facts from us all\r\nthis time, collating and relating them, and making inferences, laid the\r\nresult of their labors before the council.\r\n\r\nLittle had we thought that our careful efforts at concealment had been\r\nso easily seen through, with never a word to show us that they saw. They\r\nhad followed up words of ours on the science of optics, asked innocent\r\nquestions about glasses and the like, and were aware of the defective\r\neyesight so common among us.\r\n\r\nWith the lightest touch, different women asking different questions at\r\ndifferent times, and putting all our answers together like a picture\r\npuzzle, they had figured out a sort of skeleton chart as to the\r\nprevalence of disease among us. Even more subtly with no show of horror\r\nor condemnation, they had gathered something--far from the truth, but\r\nsomething pretty clear--about poverty, vice, and crime. They even had\r\na goodly number of our dangers all itemized, from asking us about\r\ninsurance and innocent things like that.\r\n\r\nThey were well posted as to the different races, beginning with their\r\npoison-arrow natives down below and widening out to the broad racial\r\ndivisions we had told them about. Never a shocked expression of the face\r\nor exclamation of revolt had warned us; they had been extracting the\r\nevidence without our knowing it all this time, and now were studying\r\nwith the most devout earnestness the matter they had prepared.\r\n\r\nThe result was rather distressing to us. They first explained the matter\r\nfully to Ellador, as she was the one who purposed visiting the Rest\r\nof the World. To Celis they said nothing. She must not be in any way\r\ndistressed, while the whole nation waited on her Great Work.\r\n\r\nFinally Jeff and I were called in. Somel and Zava were there, and\r\nEllador, with many others that we knew.\r\n\r\nThey had a great globe, quite fairly mapped out from the small section\r\nmaps in that compendium of ours. They had the different peoples of the\r\nearth roughly outlined, and their status in civilization indicated.\r\nThey had charts and figures and estimates, based on the facts in that\r\ntraitorous little book and what they had learned from us.\r\n\r\nSomel explained: \"We find that in all your historic period, so much\r\nlonger than ours, that with all the interplay of services, the exchange\r\nof inventions and discoveries, and the wonderful progress we so admire,\r\nthat in this widespread Other World of yours, there is still much\r\ndisease, often contagious.\"\r\n\r\nWe admitted this at once.\r\n\r\n\"Also there is still, in varying degree, ignorance, with prejudice and\r\nunbridled emotion.\"\r\n\r\nThis too was admitted.\r\n\r\n\"We find also that in spite of the advance of democracy and the increase\r\nof wealth, that there is still unrest and sometimes combat.\"\r\n\r\nYes, yes, we admitted it all. We were used to these things and saw no\r\nreason for so much seriousness.\r\n\r\n\"All things considered,\" they said, and they did not say a hundredth\r\npart of the things they were considering, \"we are unwilling to expose\r\nour country to free communication with the rest of the world--as yet. If\r\nEllador comes back, and we approve her report, it may be done later--but\r\nnot yet.\r\n\r\n\"So we have this to ask of you gentlemen [they knew that word was held\r\na title of honor with us], that you promise not in any way to betray the\r\nlocation of this country until permission--after Ellador's return.\"\r\n\r\nJeff was perfectly satisfied. He thought they were quite right. He\r\nalways did. I never saw an alien become naturalized more quickly than\r\nthat man in Herland.\r\n\r\nI studied it awhile, thinking of the time they'd have if some of our\r\ncontagions got loose there, and concluded they were right. So I agreed.\r\n\r\nTerry was the obstacle. \"Indeed I won't!\" he protested. \"The first\r\nthing I'll do is to get an expedition fixed up to force an entrance into\r\nMa-land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" they said quite calmly, \"he must remain an absolute prisoner,\r\nalways.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anesthesia would be kinder,\" urged Moadine.\r\n\r\n\"And safer,\" added Zava.\r\n\r\n\"He will promise, I think,\" said Ellador.\r\n\r\nAnd he did. With which agreement we at last left Herland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
