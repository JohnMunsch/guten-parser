Kehoe\r\n\r\nThis is revision 1.0 of February 2, 1992.\r\nCopyright (c) 1992 Brendan P. Kehoe\r\n\r\nThe composition of this booklet was originally started because the\r\nComputer Science department at Widener University was in desperate\r\nneed of documentation describing the capabilities of this \"great new\r\nInternet link\" we obtained.\r\n\r\nIt's since grown into an effort to acquaint the reader with much of\r\nwhat's currently available over the Internet.  Aimed at the novice\r\nuser, it attempts to remain operating system \"neutral\"---little\r\ninformation herein is specific to Unix, VMS, or any other\r\nenvironment. This booklet will, hopefully, be usable by nearly\r\nanyone.\r\n\r\nA user's session is usually offset from the rest of the paragraph, as\r\nsuch:\r\n\r\nprompt> command\r\nThe results are usually displayed here.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this booklet is two-fold: first, it's intended to\r\nserve as a reference piece, which someone can easily grab on the fly\r\nand look something up.  Also, it forms a foundation from which people\r\ncan explore the vast expanse of the Internet.  Zen and the Art of the\r\nInternet doesn't spend a significant amount of time on any one point;\r\nrather, it provides enough for people to learn the specifics of what\r\nhis or her local system offers.\r\n\r\nOne warning is perhaps in order---this territory we are entering can\r\nbecome a fantastic time-sink.  Hours can slip by, people can come and\r\ngo, and you'll be locked into Cyberspace.  Remember to do your work!\r\n\r\nWith that, I welcome you, the new user, to The Net.\r\n\r\n                    brendan@cs.widener.edu\r\n                    Chester, PA\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n\r\nCertain sections in this booklet are not my original work---rather,\r\nthey are derived from documents that were available on the Internet\r\nand already aptly stated their areas of concentration.  The chapter\r\non Usenet is, in large part, made up of what's posted monthly to\r\nnews.announce.newusers, with some editing and rewriting.  Also, the\r\nmain section on archie was derived from whatis.archie by Peter\r\nDeutsch of the McGill University Computing Centre.  It's available\r\nvia anonymous FTP from archie.mcgill.ca.  Much of what's in the\r\ntelnet section came from an impressive introductory document put\r\ntogether by SuraNet.  Some definitions in the one are from an\r\nexcellent glossary put together by Colorado State University.\r\n\r\nThis guide would not be the same without the aid of many people on The\r\nNet, and the providers of resources that are already out there.  I'd\r\nlike to thank the folks who gave this a read-through and returned some\r\nexcellent comments, suggestions, and criticisms, and those who\r\nprovided much-needed information on the fly.  Glee Willis deserves\r\nparticular mention for all of his work; this guide would have been\r\nconsiderably less polished without his help.\r\n\r\nAndy Blankenbiller <rablanke@crdec7.apgea.army.mil>\r\nAndy Blankenbiller, Army at Aberdeen\r\n\r\nbajan@cs.mcgill.ca\r\nAlan Emtage, McGill University Computer Science Department\r\n\r\nBrian Fitzgerald <fitz@mml0.meche.rpi.edu>\r\nBrian Fitzgerald, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute\r\n\r\nJohn Goetsch <ccjg@hippo.ru.ac.za>\r\nJohn Goetsch, Rhodes University, South Africa\r\n\r\ncomposer@chem.bu.edu\r\nJeff Kellem, Boston University's Chemistry Department\r\n\r\nkraussW@moravian.edu\r\nBill Krauss, Moravian College\r\n\r\nSteve Lodin <deaes!swlodin@iuvax.cs.indiana.edu>\r\nSteve Lodin, Delco Electronics\r\n\r\nMike Nesel <nesel@elxsi.dfrf.nasa.gov>\r\nMike Nesel, NASA\r\n\r\nBob <neveln@cs.widener.edu>\r\nBob Neveln, Widener University Computer Science Department\r\n\r\nwamapi@dunkin.cc.mcgill.ca (Wanda Pierce)\r\nWanda Pierce, McGill University Computing Centre\r\n\r\nJoshua.R.Poulson@cyber.widener.edu\r\nJoshua Poulson, Widener University Computing Services\r\n\r\nde5@ornl.gov\r\nDave Sill, Oak Ridge National Laboratory\r\n\r\nbsmart@bsmart.tti.com\r\nBob Smart, CitiCorp/TTI\r\n\r\nemv@msen.com\r\nEd Vielmetti, Vice President of MSEN\r\n\r\nCraig E.

Now more than ever, moving\r\nvast amounts of information quickly across great distances is one of\r\nour most pressing needs.  From small one-person entrepreneurial\r\nefforts, to the largest of corporations, more and more professional\r\npeople are discovering that the only way to be successful in the '90s\r\nand beyond is to realize that technology is advancing at a break-neck\r\npace---and they must somehow keep up.  Likewise, researchers from all\r\ncorners of the earth are finding that their work thrives in a\r\nnetworked environment.  Immediate access to the work of colleagues\r\nand a \"virtual\" library of millions of volumes and thousands of\r\npapers affords them the ability to encorporate a body of knowledge\r\nheretofore unthinkable.  Work groups can now conduct interactive\r\nconferences with each other, paying no heed to physical\r\nlocation---the possibilities are endless.\r\n\r\nYou have at your fingertips the ability to talk in \"real-time\" with\r\nsomeone in Japan, send a 2,000-word short story to a group of people\r\nwho will critique it for the sheer pleasure of doing so, see if a\r\nMacintosh sitting in a lab in Canada is turned on, and find out if\r\nsomeone happens to be sitting in front of their computer (logged on)\r\nin Australia, all inside of thirty minutes.  No airline (or tardis,\r\nfor that matter) could ever match that travel itinerary.\r\n\r\nThe largest problem people face when first using a network is\r\ngrasping all that's available.  Even seasoned users find themselves\r\nsurprised when they discover a new service or feature that they'd\r\nnever known even existed.  Once acquainted with the terminology and\r\nsufficiently comfortable with making occasional mistakes, the\r\nlearning process will drastically speed up.\r\n\r\nDomains\r\n\r\nGetting where you want to go can often be one of the more difficult\r\naspects of using networks.  The variety of ways that places are named\r\nwill probably leave a blank stare on your face at first.  Don't fret;\r\nthere is a method to this apparent madness.\r\n\r\nIf someone were to ask for a home address, they would probably expect\r\na street, apartment, city, state, and zip code.  That's all the\r\ninformation the post office needs to deliver mail in a reasonably\r\nspeedy fashion.  Likewise, computer addresses have a structure to\r\nthem.  The general form is:\r\n\r\na person's email address on a computer: user@somewhere.domain\r\na computer's name: somewhere.domain\r\n\r\nThe user portion is usually the person's account name on the\r\nsystem, though it doesn't have to be.  somewhere.domain tells\r\nyou the name of a system or location, and what kind of organization it\r\nis. The trailing domain is often one of the following:\r\n\r\ncom\r\nUsually a company or other commercial institution or organization,\r\nlike Convex Computers (convex.com).\r\n\r\nedu\r\nAn educational institution, e.g. New York University, named nyu.edu.\r\n\r\ngov\r\nA government site; for example, NASA is nasa.gov.\r\n\r\nmil\r\nA military site, like the Air Force (af.mil).\r\n\r\nnet\r\nGateways and other administrative hosts for a network (it does not\r\nmean all of the hosts in a network). {The Matrix, 111.  One such\r\ngateway is near.net.}\r\n\r\norg\r\nThis is a domain reserved for private organizations, who don't\r\ncomfortably fit in the other classes of domains.  One example is the\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation named eff.org.\r\n\r\nEach country also has its own top-level domain.  For example, the\r\nus domain includes each of the fifty states.  Other countries\r\nrepresented with domains include:\r\n\r\nau Australia\r\nca Canada\r\nfr France\r\nuk The United Kingdom.  These also have sub-domains of things like\r\nac.uk for academic sites and co.uk for commercial ones.\r\n\r\nFQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)\r\n\r\nThe proper terminology for a site's domain name (somewhere.domain\r\nabove) is its Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).  It is usually\r\nselected to give a clear indication of the site's organization or\r\nsponsoring agent.  For example, the Massachusetts Institute of\r\nTechnology's FQDN is mit.edu; similarly, Apple Computer's domain name\r\nis apple.com.  While such obvious names are usually the norm, there\r\nare the occasional exceptions that are ambiguous enough to\r\nmislead---like vt.edu, which on first impulse one might surmise is an\r\neducational institution of some sort in Vermont; not so.  It's\r\nactually the domain name for Virginia Tech.  In most cases it's\r\nrelatively easy to glean the meaning of a domain name---such\r\nconfusion is far from the norm.\r\n\r\nInternet Numbers\r\n\r\nEvery single machine on the Internet has a unique address, {At least\r\none address, possibly two or even three---but we won't  go into\r\nthat.} called its Internet number or IP Address.  It's actually a\r\n32-bit number, but is most commonly represented as four numbers\r\njoined by periods (.), like 147.31.254.130. This is sometimes also\r\ncalled a dotted quad; there are literally thousands of different\r\npossible dotted quads.  The ARPAnet (the mother to today's Internet)\r\noriginally only had the capacity to have up to 256 systems on it\r\nbecause of the way each system was addressed.  In the early eighties,\r\nit became clear that things would fast outgrow such a small limit;\r\nthe 32-bit addressing method was born, freeing thousands of host\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nEach piece of an Internet address (like 192) is called an \"octet,\"\r\nrepresenting one of four sets of eight bits.  The first two or three\r\npieces (e.g. 192.55.239) represent the network that a system is on,\r\ncalled its subnet.  For example, all of the computers for Wesleyan\r\nUniversity are in the subnet 129.133. They can have numbers like\r\n129.133.10.10, 129.133.230.19, up to 65 thousand possible\r\ncombinations (possible computers).\r\n\r\nIP addresses and domain names aren't assigned arbitrarily---that\r\nwould lead to unbelievable confusion.  An application must be filed\r\nwith the Network Information Center (NIC), either electronically (to\r\nhostmaster@nic.ddn.mil) or via regular mail.\r\n\r\nResolving Names and Numbers\r\n\r\nOk, computers can be referred to by either their FQDN or their\r\nInternet address.  How can one user be expected to remember them all?\r\n\r\nThey aren't.  The Internet is designed so that one can use either\r\nmethod.  Since humans find it much more natural to deal with words\r\nthan numbers in most cases, the FQDN for each host is mapped to its\r\nInternet number.  Each domain is served by a computer within that\r\ndomain, which provides all of the necessary information to go from a\r\ndomain name to an IP address, and vice-versa.  For example, when\r\nsomeone refers to foosun.bar.com, the resolver knows that it should\r\nask the system foovax.bar.com about systems in bar.com.  It asks what\r\nInternet address foosun.bar.com has; if the name foosun.bar.com\r\nreally exists, foovax will send back its number.  All of this\r\n\"magic\" happens behind the scenes.\r\n\r\nRarely will a user have to remember the Internet number of a site\r\n(although often you'll catch yourself remembering an apparently\r\nobscure number, simply because you've accessed the system\r\nfrequently). However, you will remember a substantial number of\r\nFQDNs.  It will eventually reach a point when you are able to make a\r\nreasonably accurate guess at what domain name a certain college,\r\nuniversity, or company might have, given just their name.\r\n\r\nThe Networks\r\n\r\n\r\nInternet\r\nThe Internet is a large \"network of networks.\"  There is no\r\none network known as The Internet; rather, regional nets like SuraNet,\r\nPrepNet, NearNet, et al., are all inter-connected\r\n(nay, \"inter-networked\") together into one great living thing,\r\ncommunicating at amazing speeds with the TCP/IP protocol.  All\r\nactivity takes place in \"real-time.\"\r\n\r\nUUCP\r\nThe UUCP network is a loose association of systems all communicating\r\nwith the UUCP protocol.  (UUCP stands for `Unix-to-Unix Copy\r\nProgram'.)  It's based on two systems connecting to each other at\r\nspecified intervals, called polling, and executing any work\r\nscheduled for either of them.  Historically most UUCP was done with\r\nUnix equipment, although the software's since been implemented on\r\nother platforms (e.g. VMS).  For example, the system oregano\r\npolls the system basil once every two hours.  If there's any\r\nmail waiting for oregano, basil will send it at that time;\r\nlikewise, oregano will at that time send any jobs waiting for\r\nbasil.\r\n\r\nBITNET\r\nBITNET (the \"Because It's Time Network\") is comprised of systems\r\nconnected by point-to-point links, all running the NJE protocol.\r\nIt's continued to grow, but has found itself suffering at the hands of\r\nthe falling costs of Internet connections.  Also, a number of mail\r\ngateways are in place to reach users on other networks.\r\n\r\nThe Physical Connection\r\n\r\nThe actual connections between the various networks take a variety of\r\nforms.  The most prevalent for Internet links are 56k leased lines\r\n(dedicated telephone lines carrying 56kilobit-per-second connections)\r\nand T1 links (special phone lines with 1Mbps connections).  Also\r\ninstalled are T3 links, acting as backbones between major locations\r\nto carry a massive 45Mbps load of traffic.\r\n\r\nThese links are paid for by each institution to a local carrier (for\r\nexample, Bell Atlantic owns PrepNet, the main provider in\r\nPennsylvania).  Also available are SLIP connections, which carry\r\nInternet traffic (packets) over high-speed modems.\r\n\r\nUUCP links are made with modems (for the most part), that run from\r\n1200 baud all the way up to as high as 38.4Kbps.  As was mentioned in\r\nThe Networks, the connections are of the store-and-forward\r\nvariety.  Also in use are Internet-based UUCP links (as if things\r\nweren't already confusing enough!).  The systems do their UUCP traffic\r\nover TCP/IP connections, which give the UUCP-based network some\r\nblindingly fast \"hops,\" resulting in better connectivity for the\r\nnetwork as a whole.  UUCP connections first became popular in the\r\n1970's, and have remained in wide-spread use ever since.  Only with\r\nUUCP can Joe Smith correspond with someone across the country or\r\naround the world, for the price of a local telephone call.\r\n\r\nBITNET links mostly take the form of 9600bps modems connected from site\r\nto site.  Often places have three or more links going; the majority,\r\nhowever, look to \"upstream\" sites for their sole link to the network.\r\n\r\n                    \"The Glory and the Nothing of a Name\"\r\n                    Byron, {Churchill's Grave}\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n Electronic Mail\r\n\r\nThe desire to communicate is the essence of networking.  People have\r\nalways wanted to correspond with each other in the fastest way\r\npossible, short of normal conversation.  Electronic mail (or\r\nemail) is the most prevalent application of this in computer\r\nnetworking.  It allows people to write back and forth without having\r\nto spend much time worrying about how the message actually gets\r\ndelivered.  As technology grows closer and closer to being a common\r\npart of daily life, the need to understand the many ways it can be\r\nutilized and how it works, at least to some level, is vital.\r\npart of daily life (as has been evidenced by the ISDN effort, the need\r\nto understand the many ways it can be utilized and how it works, at\r\nleast to some level, is vital.\r\n\r\nEmail Addresses\r\n\r\nElectronic mail is hinged around the concept of an address; the\r\nsection on Networking Basics made some reference to it while\r\nintroducing domains.  Your email address provides all of the\r\ninformation required to get a message to you from anywhere in the\r\nworld.  An address doesn't necessarily have to go to a human being.\r\nIt could be an archive server, {See Archive Servers, for a\r\ndescription.} a list of people, or even someone's pocket pager.\r\nThese cases are the exception to the norm---mail to most addresses is\r\nread by human beings.\r\n\r\n %@!.: Symbolic Cacophony\r\n\r\nEmail addresses usually appear in one of two forms---using the\r\nInternet format which contains @, an \"at\"-sign, or using the\r\nUUCP format which contains !, an exclamation point, also called\r\na \"bang.\"  The latter of the two, UUCP \"bang\" paths, is more\r\nrestrictive, yet more clearly dictates how the mail will travel.\r\n\r\nTo reach Jim Morrison on the system south.america.org, one would\r\naddress the mail as jm@south.america.org.  But if Jim's account was\r\non a UUCP site named brazil, then his address would be brazil!jm.  If\r\nit's possible (and one exists), try to use the Internet form of an\r\naddress; bang paths can fail if an intermediate site in the path\r\nhappens to be down.  There is a growing trend for UUCP sites to\r\nregister Internet domain names, to help alleviate the problem of path\r\nfailures.\r\n\r\nAnother symbol that enters the fray is %---it acts as an extra\r\n\"routing\" method.  For example, if the UUCP site dream is connected\r\nto south.america.org, but doesn't have an Internet domain name of its\r\nown, a user debbie on dream can be reached by writing to the address\r\nnot smallexample!\r\n\r\n     debbie%dream@south.america.org\r\n\r\nThe form is significant.  This address says that the local system\r\nshould first send the mail to south.america.org.  There the address\r\ndebbie%dream will turn into debbie@dream, which will hopefully be a\r\nvalid address.  Then south.america.org will handle getting the mail\r\nto the host dream, where it will be delivered locally to debbie.\r\n\r\nAll of the intricacies of email addressing methods are fully covered\r\nin the book \"!%@@:: A Directory of Electronic Mail Addressing and\r\nNetworks\" published by O'Reilly and Associates, as part of their\r\nNutshell Handbook series.  It is a must for any active email user.\r\nWrite to nuts@ora.com for ordering information.\r\n\r\n Sending and Receiving Mail\r\n\r\nWe'll make one quick diversion from being OS-neuter here, to show you\r\nwhat it will look like to send and receive a mail message on a Unix\r\nsystem.  Check with your system administrator for specific\r\ninstructions related to mail at your site.\r\n\r\nA person sending the author mail would probably do something like this:\r\n\r\n% mail brendan@cs.widener.edu\r\nSubject: print job's stuck\r\n\r\nI typed `print babe.gif' and it didn't work! Why??\r\n\r\nThe next time the author checked his mail, he would see it listed in\r\nhis mailbox as:\r\n\r\n% mail\r\n\"/usr/spool/mail/brendan\": 1 messages 1 new 1 unread\r\nU  1 joeuser@foo.widene Tue May  5 20:36   29/956   print job's stuck\r\n?\r\n\r\nwhich gives information on the sender of the email, when it was sent,\r\nand the subject of the message.  He would probably use the\r\nreply command of Unix mail to send this response:\r\n\r\n? r\r\nTo: joeuser@@foo.widener.edu\r\nSubject: Re: print job's stuck\r\n\r\nYou shouldn't print binary files like GIFs to a printer!\r\n\r\nBrendan\r\n\r\nTry sending yourself mail a few times, to get used to your system's\r\nmailer.  It'll save a lot of wasted aspirin for both you and your\r\nsystem administrator.\r\n\r\n Anatomy of a Mail Header\r\n\r\nAn electronic mail message has a specific structure to it that's\r\ncommon across every type of computer system. {The standard is written\r\ndown in RFC-822.

Please\r\ndon't oversleep this time.\r\n\r\nThe first line, with From and the two lines for Received: are usually\r\nnot very interesting.  They give the \"real\" address that the mail\r\nis coming from (as opposed to the address you should reply to, which\r\nmay look much different), and what places the mail went through to\r\nget to you.  Over the Internet, there is always at least one\r\nReceived: header and usually no more than four or five.  When a\r\nmessage is sent using UUCP, one Received: header is added for each\r\nsystem that the mail passes through.  This can often result in more\r\nthan a dozen Received: headers.  While they help with dissecting\r\nproblems in mail delivery, odds are the average user will never want\r\nto see them.  Most mail programs will filter out this kind of\r\n\"cruft\" in a header.\r\n\r\nThe Date: header contains the date and time the message was\r\nsent.  Likewise, the \"good\" address (as opposed to \"real\" address)\r\nis laid out in the From: header.  Sometimes it won't include\r\nthe full name of the person (in this case The President), and\r\nmay look different, but it should always contain an email address of\r\nsome form.\r\n\r\nThe Message-ID: of a message is intended mainly for tracing\r\nmail routing, and is rarely of interest to normal users.  Every\r\nMessage-ID: is guaranteed to be unique.\r\n\r\nTo: lists the email address (or addresses) of the recipients of\r\nthe message.  There may be a Cc: header, listing additional\r\naddresses.  Finally, a brief subject for the message goes in the\r\nSubject: header.\r\n\r\nThe exact order of a message's headers may vary from system to system,\r\nbut it will always include these fundamental headers that are vital to\r\nproper delivery.\r\n\r\n Bounced Mail\r\n\r\nWhen an email address is incorrect in some way (the system's name is\r\nwrong, the domain doesn't exist, whatever), the mail system will\r\nbounce the message back to the sender, much the same way that the\r\nPostal Service does when you send a letter to a bad street address.\r\nThe message will include the reason for the bounce; a common error is\r\naddressing mail to an account name that doesn't exist.  For example,\r\nwriting to Lisa Simpson at Widener University's Computer Science\r\ndepartment will fail, because she doesn't have an account. {Though if\r\nshe asked, we'd certainly give her one.}\r\n\r\nFrom: Mail Delivery Subsystem <MAILER-DAEMON>\r\nDate: Sat, 25 May 91 16:45:14 -0400\r\nTo: mg@gracie.com\r\nCc: Postmaster@cs.widener.edu\r\nSubject: Returned mail: User unknown\r\n\r\n----- Transcript of session follows -----\r\nWhile talking to cs.widener.edu:\r\n>>> RCPT To:<lsimpson@cs.widener.edu>\r\n<<< 550 <lsimpson@cs.widener.edu>... User unknown\r\n550 lsimpson... User unknown\r\n\r\nAs you can see, a carbon copy of the message (the Cc: header\r\nentry) was sent to the postmaster of Widener's CS department.  The\r\nPostmaster is responsible for maintaining a reliable mail system\r\non his system.  Usually postmasters at sites will attempt to aid you\r\nin getting your mail where it's supposed to go.  If a typing error was\r\nmade, then try re-sending the message.  If you're sure that the\r\naddress is correct, contact the postmaster of the site directly and\r\nask him how to properly address it.\r\n\r\nThe message also includes the text of the mail, so you don't have to\r\nretype everything you wrote.\r\n\r\n----- Unsent message follows -----\r\nReceived: by cs.widener.edu id AA06528; Sat, 25 May 91 16:45:14 -0400\r\nDate: Sat, 25 May 91 16:45:14 -0400\r\nFrom: Matt Groening <mg@gracie.com>\r\nMessage-Id: <9105252045.AA06528@gracie.com>\r\nTo: lsimpson@cs.widener.edu\r\nSubject: Scripting your future episodes\r\nReply-To: writing-group@gracie.com\r\n\r\n.... verbiage ...\r\n\r\nThe full text of the message is returned intact, including any headers\r\nthat were added.  This can be cut out with an editor and fed right\r\nback into the mail system with a proper address, making redelivery a\r\nrelatively painless process.\r\n\r\nMailing Lists\r\n\r\nPeople that share common interests are inclined to discuss their\r\nhobby or interest at every available opportunity.  One modern way to\r\naid in this exchange of information is by using a mailing\r\nlist---usually an email address that redistributes all mail sent to\r\nit back out to a list of addresses.  For example, the Sun Managers\r\nmailing list (of interest to people that administer computers\r\nmanufactured by Sun) has the address sun-managers@eecs.nwu.edu.  Any\r\nmail sent to that address will \"explode\" out to each person named\r\nin a file maintained on a computer at Northwestern University.\r\n\r\nAdministrative tasks (sometimes referred to as administrivia) are\r\noften handled through other addresses, typically with the suffix\r\n-request.  To continue the above, a request to be added to or deleted\r\nfrom the Sun Managers list should be sent to\r\nsun-managers-request@eecs.nwu.edu.\r\n\r\nWhen in doubt, try to write to the -request version of a mailing list\r\naddress first; the other people on the list aren't interested in your\r\ndesire to be added or deleted, and can certainly do nothing to\r\nexpedite your request.  Often if the administrator of a list is busy\r\n(remember, this is all peripheral to real jobs and real work), many\r\nusers find it necessary to ask again and again, often with harsher\r\nand harsher language, to be removed from a list.  This does nothing\r\nmore than waste traffic and bother everyone else receiving the\r\nmessages.  If, after a reasonable amount of time, you still haven't\r\nsucceeded to be removed from a mailing list, write to the postmaster\r\nat that site and see if they can help.\r\n\r\nExercise caution when replying to a message sent by a mailing list.  If\r\nyou wish to respond to the author only, make sure that the only\r\naddress you're replying to is that person, and not the entire list.\r\nOften messages of the sort \"Yes, I agree with you completely!\" will\r\nappear on a list, boring the daylights out of the other readers.  Likewise,\r\nif you explicitly do want to send the message to the whole list,\r\nyou'll save yourself some time by checking to make sure it's indeed\r\nheaded to the whole list and not a single person.\r\n\r\nA list of the currently available mailing lists is available in at\r\nleast two places; the first is in a file on ftp.nisc.sri.com called\r\ninterest-groups under the netinfo/ directory. It's updated fairly\r\nregularly, but is large (presently around 700K), so only get it every\r\nonce in a while.  The other list is maintained by Gene Spafford\r\n(spaf@cs.purdue.edu), and is posted in parts to the newsgroup\r\nnews.lists semi-regularly. (Usenet News, for info on how to read that\r\nand other newsgroups.)\r\n\r\n Listservs\r\n\r\nOn BITNET there's an automated system for maintaining discussion lists\r\ncalled the listserv.  Rather than have an already harried and\r\noverworked human take care of additions and removals from a list, a\r\nprogram performs these and other tasks by responding to a set of\r\nuser-driven commands.\r\n\r\nAreas of interest are wide and varied---ETHICS-L deals with ethics in\r\ncomputing, while ADND-L has to do with a role-playing game.  A full\r\nlist of the available BITNET lists can be obtained by writing to\r\nLISTSERV@BITNIC.BITNET with a body containing the command\r\n\r\nlist global\r\n\r\nHowever, be sparing in your use of this---see if it's already on your\r\nsystem somewhere.  The reply is quite large.\r\n\r\nThe most fundamental command is subscribe.  It will tell the\r\nlistserv to add the sender to a specific list.  The usage is\r\n\r\nsubscribe foo-l Your Real Name\r\n\r\nIt will respond with a message either saying that you've been added to\r\nthe list, or that the request has been passed on to the system on\r\nwhich the list is actually maintained.\r\n\r\nThe mate to subscribe is, naturally, unsubscribe.  It will remove a\r\ngiven address from a BITNET list.  It, along with all other listserv\r\ncommands, can be abbreviated---subscribe as sub, unsubscribe as\r\nunsub, etc.  For a full list of the available listserv commands,\r\nwrite to LISTSERV@BITNIC.BITNET, giving it the command help.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, there have been implementations of the listserv system\r\nfor non-BITNET hosts (more specifically, Unix systems).  One of the\r\nmost complete is available on cs.bu.edu in the\r\ndirectory pub/listserv.\r\n\r\n\"I made this letter longer than usual because\r\nI lack the time to make it shorter.\"\r\nPascal, Provincial Letters XVI\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n Anonymous FTP\r\n\r\nFTP (File Transfer Protocol) is the primary method of transferring\r\nfiles over the Internet.  On many systems, it's also the name of the\r\nprogram that implements the protocol. Given proper permission, it's\r\npossible to copy a file from a computer in South Africa to one in Los\r\nAngeles at very fast speeds (on the order of 5--10K per second).\r\nThis normally requires either a user id on both systems or a special\r\nconfiguration set up by the system administrator(s).\r\n\r\nThere is a good way around this restriction---the anonymous FTP\r\nservice.  It essentially will let anyone in the world have access to\r\na certain area of disk space in a non-threatening way.  With this,\r\npeople can make files publicly available with little hassle.  Some\r\nsystems have dedicated entire disks or even entire computers to\r\nmaintaining extensive archives of source code and information.  They\r\ninclude gatekeeper.dec.com (Digital), wuarchive.wustl.edu (Washington\r\nUniversity in Saint Louis), and archive.cis.ohio-state.edu (The Ohio\r\nState University).\r\n\r\nThe process involves the \"foreign\" user (someone not on the system\r\nitself) creating an FTP connection and logging into the system as the\r\nuser anonymous, with an arbitrary password:\r\n\r\nName (foo.site.com:you): anonymous\r\nPassword: jm@south.america.org\r\n\r\nCustom and netiquette dictate that people respond to the\r\nPassword: query with an email address so that the sites can\r\ntrack the level of FTP usage, if they desire.  (Addresses for\r\ninformation on email addresses).\r\n\r\nThe speed of the transfer depends on the speed of the underlying\r\nlink. A site that has a 9600bps SLIP connection will not get the same\r\nthroughput as a system with a 56k leased line (The Physical\r\nConnection, for more on what kinds of connections can exist in a\r\nnetwork).  Also, the traffic of all other users on that link will\r\naffect performance.  If there are thirty people all FTPing from one\r\nsite simultaneously, the load on the system (in addition to the\r\nnetwork connection) will degrade the overall throughput of the\r\ntransfer.\r\n\r\nFTP Etiquette\r\n\r\nLest we forget, the Internet is there for people to do work.  People\r\nusing the network and the systems on it are doing so for a purpose,\r\nwhether it be research, development, whatever.  Any heavy activity\r\ntakes away from the overall performance of the network as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe effects of an FTP connection on a site and its link can vary; the\r\ngeneral rule of thumb is that any extra traffic created detracts from\r\nthe ability of that site's users to perform their tasks.  To help be\r\nconsiderate of this, it's highly recommended that FTP sessions\r\nbe held only after normal business hours for that site, preferably\r\nlate at night.  The possible effects of a large transfer will be less\r\ndestructive at 2 a.m. than 2 p.m.  Also, remember that if it's past\r\ndinner time in Maine, it's still early afternoon in California---think\r\nin terms of the current time at the site that's being visited, not of\r\nlocal time.\r\n\r\nBasic Commands\r\n\r\nWhile there have been many extensions to the various FTP clients out\r\nthere, there is a de facto \"standard\" set that everyone expects to\r\nwork.  For more specific information, read the manual for your\r\nspecific FTP program.  This section will only skim the bare minimum of\r\ncommands needed to operate an FTP session.\r\n\r\n Creating the Connection\r\n\r\nThe actual command to use FTP will vary among operating systems; for\r\nthe sake of clarity, we'll use FTP here, since it's the most\r\ngeneral form.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to connect to a system---using its hostname\r\nor its Internet number.  Using the hostname is usually preferred.\r\nHowever, some sites aren't able to resolve hostnames properly,\r\nand have no alternative.  We'll assume you're able to use hostnames\r\nfor simplicity's sake.  The form is\r\n\r\nftp somewhere.domain\r\n\r\nDomains for help with reading and using domain names\r\n(in the example below, somewhere.domain is ftp.uu.net).\r\n\r\nYou must first know the name of the system you want to connect to.\r\nWe'll use ftp.uu.net as an example.  On your system, type:\r\n\r\nftp ftp.uu.net\r\n\r\n (the actual syntax will vary depending on the type of system the\r\nconnection's being made from).  It will pause momentarily then respond\r\nwith the message\r\n\r\nConnected to ftp.uu.net.\r\n\r\nand an initial prompt will appear:\r\n\r\n220 uunet FTP server (Version 5.100 Mon Feb 11 17:13:28 EST 1991) ready.\r\nName (ftp.uu.net:jm):\r\n\r\nto which you should respond with anonymous:\r\n\r\n220 uunet FTP server (Version 5.100 Mon Feb 11 17:13:28 EST 1991) ready.\r\nName (ftp.uu.net:jm): anonymous\r\n\r\nThe system will then prompt you for a password; as noted previously, a\r\ngood response is your email address:\r\n\r\n331 Guest login ok, send ident as password.\r\nPassword: jm@south.america.org\r\n230 Guest login ok, access restrictions apply.\r\nftp>\r\n\r\nThe password itself will not echo.  This is to protect a user's\r\nsecurity when he or she is using a real account to FTP files between\r\nmachines.  Once you reach the ftp> prompt, you know you're\r\nlogged in and ready to go.\r\n\r\nNotice the ftp.uu.net:joe in the Name: prompt?  That's\r\nanother clue that anonymous FTP is special: FTP expects a normal user\r\naccounts to be used for transfers.\r\n\r\n dir\r\nAt the ftp> prompt, you can type a number of commands to perform\r\nvarious functions.  One example is dir---it will list the files\r\nin the current directory. Continuing the example from above:\r\n\r\nftp> dir\r\n\r\n200 PORT command successful.\r\n150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for /bin/ls.\r\ntotal 3116\r\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 7        21            512 Nov 21  1988 .forward\r\n-rw-rw-r--  1 7        11              0 Jun 23  1988 .hushlogin\r\ndrwxrwxr-x  2 0        21            512 Jun  4  1990 Census\r\ndrwxrwxr-x  2 0        120           512 Jan  8 09:36 ClariNet\r\n                ... etc etc ...\r\n-rw-rw-r--  1 7        14          42390 May 20 02:24 newthisweek.Z\r\n                ... etc etc ...\r\n-rw-rw-r--  1 7        14        2018887 May 21 01:01 uumap.tar.Z\r\ndrwxrwxr-x  2 7        6            1024 May 11 10:58 uunet-info\r\n\r\n226 Transfer complete.\r\n5414 bytes received in 1.1 seconds (4.9 Kbytes/s)\r\nftp>\r\n\r\nThe file newthisweek.Z was specifically included because we'll\r\nbe using it later.  Just for general information, it happens to be a\r\nlisting of all of the files added to UUNET's archives during the past\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nThe directory shown is on a machine running the Unix operating\r\nsystem---the dir command will produce different results on other\r\noperating systems (e.g. TOPS, VMS, et al.).  Learning to recognize\r\ndifferent formats will take some time.  After a few weeks of\r\ntraversing the Internet, it proves easier to see, for example, how\r\nlarge a file is on an operating system you're otherwise not acquainted\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nWith many FTP implementations, it's also possible to take the output\r\nof dir and put it into a file on the local system with\r\n\r\nftp> dir n* outfilename\r\n\r\nthe contents of which can then be read outside of the live FTP\r\nconnection; this is particularly useful for systems with very long\r\ndirectories (like ftp.uu.net).  The above example would put the\r\nnames of every file that begins with an n into the local file\r\noutfilename.\r\n\r\n cd\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of an FTP session, the user is in a \"top-level\"\r\ndirectory.  Most things are in directories below it (e.g. /pub).  To\r\nchange the current directory, one uses the cd command.  To change to\r\nthe directory pub, for example, one would type\r\n\r\nftp> cd pub\r\n\r\nwhich would elicit the response\r\n\r\n250 CWD command successful.\r\n\r\nMeaning the \"Change Working Directory\" command (cd) worked\r\nproperly.  Moving \"up\" a directory is more system-specific---in Unix\r\nuse the command cd .., and in VMS, cd [-].\r\n\r\n get and put\r\n\r\nThe actual transfer is performed with the get and put\r\ncommands.  To get a file from the remote computer to the local\r\nsystem, the command takes the form:\r\n\r\nftp> get filename\r\n\r\nwhere filename is the file on the remote system.  Again using\r\nftp.uu.net as an example, the file newthisweek.Z can be\r\nretrieved with\r\n\r\nftp> get newthisweek.Z\r\n200 PORT command successful.\r\n150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for newthisweek.Z (42390 bytes).\r\n226 Transfer complete.\r\nlocal: newthisweek.Z remote: newthisweek.Z\r\n42553 bytes received in 6.9 seconds (6 Kbytes/s)\r\nftp>\r\n\r\nThe section below on using binary mode instead of ASCII will describe\r\nwhy this particular choice will result in a corrupt and subsequently\r\nunusable file.\r\n\r\nIf, for some reason, you want to save a file under a different name\r\n(e.g. your system can only have 14-character filenames, or can only\r\nhave one dot in the name), you can specify what the local filename\r\nshould be by providing get with an additional argument\r\n\r\nftp> get newthisweek.Z uunet-new\r\n\r\nwhich will place the contents of the file newthisweek.Z in\r\nuunet-new on the local system.\r\n\r\nThe transfer works the other way, too.  The put command will\r\ntransfer a file from the local system to the remote system.  If the\r\npermissions are set up for an FTP session to write to a remote\r\ndirectory, a file can be sent with\r\n\r\nftp> put filename\r\n\r\nAs with get, put will take a third argument, letting you\r\nspecify a different name for the file on the remote system.\r\n\r\n ASCII vs Binary\r\n\r\nIn the example above, the file newthisweek.Z was transferred, but\r\nsupposedly not correctly.  The reason is this: in a normal ASCII\r\ntransfer (the default), certain characters are translated between\r\nsystems, to help make text files more readable.  However, when binary\r\nfiles (those containing non-ASCII characters) are transferred, this\r\ntranslation should not take place.  One example is a binary\r\nprogram---a few changed characters can render it completely useless.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this problem, it's possible to be in one of two modes---ASCII\r\nor binary.  In binary mode, the file isn't translated in any way.\r\nWhat's on the remote system is precisely what's received.  The\r\ncommands to go between the two modes are:\r\n\r\nftp> ascii\r\n200 Type set to A.   (Note the A, which signifies ASCII mode.)\r\n\r\nftp> binary\r\n200 Type set to I.   (Set to Image format, for pure binary transfers.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that each command need only be done once to take effect; if the\r\nuser types binary, all transfers in that session are done in\r\nbinary mode (that is, unless ascii is typed later).\r\n\r\nThe transfer of newthisweek.Z will work if done as:\r\n\r\nftp> binary\r\n200 Type set to I.\r\nftp> get newthisweek.Z\r\n200 PORT command successful.\r\n150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for newthisweek.Z (42390 bytes).\r\n226 Transfer complete.\r\nlocal: newthisweek.Z remote: newthisweek.Z\r\n42390 bytes received in 7.2 seconds (5.8 Kbytes/s)\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: The file size (42390) is different from that done\r\nin ASCII mode (42553) bytes; and the number 42390 matches the one\r\nin the listing of UUNET's top directory.  We can be relatively sure\r\nthat we've received the file without any problems.\r\n\r\n mget and mput\r\n\r\nThe commands mget and mput allow for multiple file\r\ntransfers using wildcards to get several files, or a whole set of\r\nfiles at once, rather than having to do it manually one by one.  For\r\nexample, to get all files that begin with the letter f, one\r\nwould type\r\n\r\nftp> mget f*\r\n\r\nSimilarly, to put all of the local files that end with .c:\r\n\r\nftp> mput *.c\r\n\r\nRather than reiterate what's been written a hundred times before,\r\nconsult a local manual for more information on wildcard matching\r\n(every DOS manual, for example, has a section on it).\r\n\r\nNormally, FTP assumes a user wants to be prompted for every file in a\r\nmget or mput operation.  You'll often need to get a whole set of\r\nfiles and not have each of them confirmed---you know they're all\r\nright.  In that case, use the prompt command to turn the queries off.\r\n\r\nftp> prompt\r\nInteractive mode off.\r\n\r\nLikewise, to turn it back on, the prompt command should simply\r\nbe issued again.\r\n\r\nJoe Granrose's List\r\nMonthly, Joe Granrose (odin@pilot.njin.net) posts to Usenet\r\n(Usenet News) an extensive list of sites offering anonymous FTP\r\nservice.  It's available in a number of ways:\r\n\r\nThe Usenet groups comp.misc and comp.sources.wanted\r\n\r\nAnonymous FTP from pilot.njin.net [128.6.7.38], in\r\n/pub/ftp-list.\r\n\r\nWrite to odin@pilot.njin.net with a Subject: line of listserv-request\r\nand a message body of send help.  Please don't bother Joe with your\r\nrequests---the server will provide you with the list.\r\n\r\nThe archie Server\r\narchie is always in lowercase\r\n\r\nA group of people at McGill University in Canada got together and created a\r\nquery system called archie.  It was originally formed to be a\r\nquick and easy way to scan the offerings of the many anonymous FTP\r\nsites that are maintained around the world.  As time progressed,\r\narchie grew to include other valuable services as well.\r\n\r\nThe archie service is accessible through an interactive telnet\r\nsession, email queries, and command-line and X-window clients.  The\r\nemail responses can be used along with FTPmail servers for those not\r\non the Internet.  (FTP-by-Mail Servers, for info on using FTPmail\r\nservers.)\r\n\r\n Using archie Today\r\n\r\nCurrently, archie tracks the contents of over 800 anonymous FTP\r\narchive sites containing over a million files stored across the\r\nInternet.  Collectively, these files represent well over 50 gigabytes\r\nof information, with new entries being added daily.\r\n\r\nThe archie server automatically updates the listing information from\r\neach site about once a month.

Every day on Usenet the \"blind men and the\r\nelephant\" phenomenon appears, in spades.  In the opinion of the\r\nauthor, more flame wars (rabid arguments) arise because of a\r\nlack of understanding of the nature of Usenet than from any other\r\nsource.  And consider that such flame wars arise, of necessity, among\r\npeople who are on Usenet.  Imagine, then, how poorly understood Usenet\r\nmust be by those outside!\r\n\r\nNo essay on the nature of Usenet can ignore the erroneous impressions\r\nheld by many Usenet users.  Therefore, this section will treat\r\nfalsehoods first.  Keep reading for truth.  (Beauty, alas, is not\r\nrelevant to Usenet.)\r\n\r\nWhat Usenet Is\r\n\r\nUsenet is the set of machines that exchange articles tagged with one\r\nor more universally-recognized labels, called newsgroups (or\r\n\"groups\" for short).  (Note that the term newsgroup is correct,\r\nwhile area, base, board, bboard, conference, round table, SIG, etc.\r\nare incorrect.  If you want to be understood, be accurate.)\r\n\r\nThe Diversity of Usenet\r\n\r\nIf the above definition of Usenet sounds vague, that's because it is.\r\nIt is almost impossible to generalize over all Usenet sites in any\r\nnon-trivial way.  Usenet encompasses government agencies, large\r\nuniversities, high schools, businesses of all sizes, home computers of\r\nall descriptions, etc.\r\n\r\nEvery administrator controls his own site.  No one has any real\r\ncontrol over any site but his own.  The administrator gets his power\r\nfrom the owner of the system he administers.  As long as the owner is\r\nhappy with the job the administrator is doing, he can do whatever he\r\npleases, up to and including cutting off Usenet entirely.  C'est\r\nla vie.\r\n\r\nWhat Usenet Is Not\r\n\r\nUsenet is not an organization.\r\nUsenet has no central authority.  In fact, it has no central anything.\r\nThere is a vague notion of \"upstream\" and \"downstream\" related to\r\nthe direction of high-volume news flow.  It follows that, to the\r\nextent that \"upstream\" sites decide what traffic they will carry for\r\ntheir \"downstream\" neighbors, that \"upstream\" sites have some\r\ninfluence on their neighbors.  But such influence is usually easy to\r\ncircumvent, and heavy-handed manipulation typically results in a\r\nbacklash of resentment.\r\n\r\nUsenet is not a democracy.\r\nA democracy can be loosely defined as \"government of the people, by\r\nthe people, for the people.\"  However, as explained above, Usenet is\r\nnot an organization, and only an organization can be run as a\r\ndemocracy.  Even a democracy must be organized, for if it lacks a\r\nmeans of enforcing the peoples' wishes, then it may as well not exist.\r\n\r\nSome people wish that Usenet were a democracy.  Many people pretend\r\nthat it is.  Both groups are sadly deluded.\r\n\r\nUsenet is not fair.\r\nAfter all, who shall decide what's fair?  For that matter, if someone\r\nis behaving unfairly, who's going to stop him?  Neither you nor I,\r\nthat's certain.\r\n\r\nUsenet is not a right.\r\nSome people misunderstand their local right of \"freedom of speech\"\r\nto mean that they have a legal right to use others' computers to say\r\nwhat they wish in whatever way they wish, and the owners of said\r\ncomputers have no right to stop them.\r\n\r\nThose people are wrong.  Freedom of speech also means freedom not to\r\nspeak; if I choose not to use my computer to aid your speech, that is\r\nmy right.  Freedom of the press belongs to those who own one.\r\n\r\nUsenet is not a public utility.\r\nSome Usenet sites are publicly funded or subsidized.  Most of them,\r\nby plain count, are not.  There is no government monopoly on Usenet,\r\nand little or no control.\r\n\r\nUsenet is not a commercial network.\r\nMany Usenet sites are academic or government organizations; in fact,\r\nUsenet originated in academia.  Therefore, there is a Usenet custom of\r\nkeeping commercial traffic to a minimum.  If such commercial traffic\r\nis generally considered worth carrying, then it may be grudgingly\r\ntolerated.  Even so, it is usually separated somehow from\r\nnon-commercial traffic; see comp.newprod.\r\n\r\nUsenet is not the Internet.\r\nThe Internet is a wide-ranging network, parts of which are subsidized\r\nby various governments.  The Internet carries many kinds of traffic;\r\nUsenet is only one of them.  And the Internet is only one of the\r\nvarious networks carrying Usenet traffic.\r\n\r\nUsenet is not a Unix network, nor even an ASCII network.\r\n\r\nDon't assume that everyone is using \"rn\" on a Unix machine.  There\r\nare Vaxen running VMS, IBM mainframes, Amigas, and MS-DOS PCs reading\r\nand posting to Usenet.  And, yes, some of them use (shudder) EBCDIC.\r\nIgnore them if you like, but they're out there.\r\n\r\nUsenet is not software.\r\nThere are dozens of software packages used at various sites to\r\ntransport and read Usenet articles.  So no one program or package can\r\nbe called \"the Usenet software.\"\r\n\r\nSoftware designed to support Usenet traffic can be (and is) used for\r\nother kinds of communication, usually without risk of mixing the two.\r\nSuch private communication networks are typically kept distinct from\r\nUsenet by the invention of newsgroup names different from the\r\nuniversally-recognized ones.\r\n\r\nUsenet is not a UUCP network.\r\n\r\nUUCP is a protocol (some might say protocol suite, but that's a\r\ntechnical point) for sending data over point-to-point connections,\r\ntypically using dialup modems.  Usenet is only one of the various\r\nkinds of traffic carried via UUCP, and UUCP is only one of the various\r\ntransports carrying Usenet traffic.\r\n\r\nWell, enough negativity.\r\n\r\nPropagation of News\r\n\r\nIn the old days, when UUCP over long-distance dialup lines was the\r\ndominant means of article transmission, a few well-connected sites\r\nhad real influence in determining which newsgroups would be carried\r\nwhere. Those sites called themselves \"the backbone.\"\r\n\r\nBut things have changed.  Nowadays, even the smallest Internet site\r\nhas connectivity the likes of which the backbone admin of yesteryear\r\ncould only dream.  In addition, in the U.S., the advent of cheaper\r\nlong-distance calls and high-speed modems has made long-distance\r\nUsenet feeds thinkable for smaller companies.  There is only one\r\npre-eminent UUCP transport site today in the U.S., namely UUNET.  But\r\nUUNET isn't a player in the propagation wars, because it never\r\nrefuses any traffic---it gets paid by the minute, after all; to\r\nrefuse based on content would jeopardize its legal status as an\r\nenhanced service provider.\r\n\r\nAll of the above applies to the U.S.  In Europe, different cost\r\nstructures favored the creation of strictly controlled hierarchical\r\norganizations with central registries.  This is all very unlike the\r\ntraditional mode of U.S. sites (pick a name, get the software, get a\r\nfeed, you're on).  Europe's \"benign monopolies\", long uncontested,\r\nnow face competition from looser organizations patterned after the\r\nU.S. model.\r\n\r\nGroup Creation\r\n\r\nAs discussed above, Usenet is not a democracy.  Nevertheless,\r\ncurrently the most popular way to create a new newsgroup involves a\r\n\"vote\" to determine popular support for (and opposition to) a\r\nproposed newsgroup. Newsgroup Creation, for detailed instructions and\r\nguidelines on the process involved in making a newsgroup.\r\n\r\nIf you follow the guidelines, it is probable that your group will be\r\ncreated and will be widely propagated.  However, due to the nature of\r\nUsenet, there is no way for any user to enforce the results of a\r\nnewsgroup vote (or any other decision, for that matter).  Therefore,\r\nfor your new newsgroup to be propagated widely, you must not only\r\nfollow the letter of the guidelines; you must also follow its spirit.\r\nAnd you must not allow even a whiff of shady dealings or dirty tricks\r\nto mar the vote.\r\n\r\nSo, you may ask: How is a new user supposed to know anything about the\r\n\"spirit\" of the guidelines?  Obviously, she can't.  This fact leads\r\ninexorably to the following recommendation:\r\n\r\nIf you're a new user, don't try to create a new newsgroup alone.\r\n\r\nIf you have a good newsgroup idea, then read the news.groups\r\nnewsgroup for a while (six months, at least) to find out how things\r\nwork.  If you're too impatient to wait six months, then you really\r\nneed to learn; read news.groups for a year instead.  If you just\r\ncan't wait, find a Usenet old hand to run the vote for you.\r\n\r\nReaders may think this advice unnecessarily strict.  Ignore it at your\r\nperil.  It is embarrassing to speak before learning.  It is foolish to\r\njump into a society you don't understand with your mouth open.  And it\r\nis futile to try to force your will on people who can tune you out\r\nwith the press of a key.\r\n\r\nIf You're Unhappy...\r\nProperty rights being what they are, there is no higher authority on\r\nUsenet than the people who own the machines on which Usenet traffic is\r\ncarried.  If the owner of the machine you use says, \"We will not\r\ncarry alt.sex on this machine,\" and you are not happy with\r\nthat order, you have no Usenet recourse.  What can we outsiders do,\r\nafter all?\r\n\r\nThat doesn't mean you are without options.  Depending on the nature\r\nof your site, you may have some internal political recourse.  Or you\r\nmight find external pressure helpful.  Or, with a minimal investment,\r\nyou can get a feed of your own from somewhere else. Computers capable\r\nof taking Usenet feeds are down in the $500 range now, Unix-capable\r\nboxes are going for under $2000, and there are at least two Unix\r\nlookalikes in the $100 price range.\r\n\r\nNo matter what, appealing to \"Usenet\" won't help.  Even if those who\r\nread such an appeal regarding system administration are sympathetic to\r\nyour cause, they will almost certainly have even less influence at\r\nyour site than you do.\r\n\r\nBy the same token, if you don't like what some user at another site is\r\ndoing, only the administrator and/or owner of that site have any\r\nauthority to do anything about it.  Persuade them that the user in\r\nquestion is a problem for them, and they might do something (if they\r\nfeel like it).  If the user in question is the administrator or owner\r\nof the site from which he or she posts, forget it; you can't win.\r\nArrange for your newsreading software to ignore articles from him or\r\nher if you can, and chalk one up to experience.\r\n\r\nThe History of Usenet (The ABCs)\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, there were conversations, and they were good.  Then\r\ncame Usenet in 1979, shortly after the release of V7 Unix with UUCP;\r\nand it was better.  Two Duke University grad students in North\r\nCarolina, Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis, thought of hooking computers\r\ntogether to exchange information with the Unix community.  Steve\r\nBellovin, a grad student at the University of North Carolina, put\r\ntogether the first version of the news software using shell scripts\r\nand installed it on the first two sites: unc and duke. At the\r\nbeginning of 1980 the network consisted of those two sites and phs\r\n(another machine at Duke), and was described at the January 1980\r\nUsenix conference in Boulder, CO. {The Usenix conferences are\r\nsemi-annual meetings where members  of the Usenix Association, a\r\ngroup of Unix enthusiasts, meet and trade notes.} Steve Bellovin\r\nlater rewrote the scripts into C programs, but they were never\r\nreleased beyond unc and duke.  Shortly thereafter, Steve Daniel did\r\nanother implementation in the C programming language for public\r\ndistribution.  Tom Truscott made further modifications, and this\r\nbecame the \"A\" news release.\r\n\r\nIn 1981 at the University of California at Berkeley, grad student Mark\r\nHorton and high school student Matt Glickman rewrote the news software\r\nto add functionality and to cope with the ever increasing volume of\r\nnews---\"A\" news was intended for only a few articles per group per\r\nday.  This rewrite was the \"B\" news version.  The first public\r\nrelease was version 2.1 in 1982; all versions before 2.1 were\r\nconsidered in beta test.  As The Net grew, the news software was\r\nexpanded and modified.  The last version maintained and released\r\nprimarily by Mark was 2.10.1.\r\n\r\nRick Adams, then at the Center for Seismic Studies, took over\r\ncoordination of the maintenance and enhancement of the news software\r\nwith the 2.10.2 release in 1984.  By this time, the increasing volume\r\nof news was becoming a concern, and the mechanism for moderated groups\r\nwas added to the software at 2.10.2.  Moderated groups were inspired\r\nby ARPA mailing lists and experience with other bulletin board\r\nsystems.  In late 1986, version 2.11 of news was released, including a\r\nnumber of changes to support a new naming structure for newsgroups,\r\nenhanced batching and compression, enhanced ihave/sendme control\r\nmessages, and other features.  The current release of news is 2.11,\r\npatchlevel 19.\r\n\r\nA new version of news, becoming known as \"C\" news, has been\r\ndeveloped at the University of Toronto by Geoff Collyer and Henry\r\nSpencer.  This version is a rewrite of the lowest levels of news to\r\nincrease article processing speed, decrease article expiration\r\nprocessing and improve the reliability of the news system through\r\nbetter locking, etc.  The package was released to The Net in the\r\nautumn of 1987.  For more information, see the paper News Need Not Be\r\nSlow, published in the Winter 1987 Usenix Technical Conference\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nUsenet software has also been ported to a number of platforms, from\r\nthe Amiga and IBM PCs all the way to minicomputers and mainframes.\r\n\r\nHierarchies\r\nNewsgroups are organized according to their specific areas of\r\nconcentration.  Since the groups are in a tree structure, the\r\nvarious areas are called hierarchies.  There are seven major categories:\r\n\r\n\r\ncomp\r\nTopics of interest to both computer professionals and\r\nhobbyists, including topics in computer science, software sources, and\r\ninformation on hardware and software systems.\r\n\r\nmisc\r\nGroup addressing themes not easily classified into any of the other\r\nheadings or which incorporate themes from multiple categories.\r\nSubjects include fitness, job-hunting, law, and investments.\r\n\r\nsci\r\nDiscussions marked by special knowledge relating to research in or\r\napplication of the established sciences.\r\n\r\n soc\r\nGroups primarily addressing social issues and socializing.  Included\r\nare discussions related to many different world cultures.\r\n\r\n talk\r\nGroups largely debate-oriented and tending to feature long\r\ndiscussions without resolution and without appreciable amounts of\r\ngenerally useful information.\r\n\r\n news\r\nGroups concerned with the news network, group maintenance, and software.\r\n\r\n rec\r\nGroups oriented towards hobbies and recreational activities\r\n\r\nThese \"world\" newsgroups are (usually) circulated around the entire\r\nUsenet---this implies world-wide distribution.  Not all groups\r\nactually enjoy such wide distribution, however.  The European Usenet\r\nand Eunet sites take only a selected subset of the more \"technical\"\r\ngroups, and controversial \"noise\" groups are often not carried by many\r\nsites in the U.S. and Canada (these groups are primarily under the talk\r\nand soc classifications).  Many sites do not carry some or all of\r\nthe comp.binaries groups because of the typically large size of\r\nthe posts in them (being actual executable programs).\r\n\r\nAlso available are a number of \"alternative\" hierarchies:\r\n\r\n\r\n alt\r\nTrue anarchy; anything and everything can and does appear;\r\nsubjects include sex, the Simpsons, and privacy.\r\n\r\n gnu\r\nGroups concentrating on interests and software with the GNU\r\nProject of the Free Software Foundation. For further info on what the\r\nFSF is, FSF.\r\n\r\n biz\r\nBusiness-related groups.\r\n\r\nModerated vs Unmoderated\r\n\r\nSome newsgroups insist that the discussion remain focused and\r\non-target; to serve this need, moderated groups came to be.  All\r\narticles posted to a moderated group get mailed to the group's\r\nmoderator.  He or she periodically (hopefully sooner than later)\r\nreviews the posts, and then either posts them individually to Usenet,\r\nor posts a composite digest of the articles for the past day or\r\ntwo.  This is how many mailing list gateways work (for example, the\r\nRisks Digest).\r\n\r\nnews.groups & news.announce.newgroups\r\n\r\nBeing a good net.citizen includes being involved in the continuing\r\ngrowth and evolution of the Usenet system.  One part of this\r\ninvolvement includes following the discussion in the groups\r\nnews.groups and the notes in news.announce.newgroups. It is there\r\nthat discussion goes on about the creation of new groups and\r\ndestruction of inactive ones.  Every person on Usenet is allowed and\r\nencouraged to vote on the creation of a newsgroup.\r\n\r\nHow Usenet Works\r\n\r\nThe transmission of Usenet news is entirely cooperative.  Feeds are\r\ngenerally provided out of good will and the desire to distribute news\r\neverywhere.  There are places which provide feeds for a fee (e.g.\r\nUUNET), but for the large part no exchange of money is involved.\r\n\r\nThere are two major transport methods, UUCP and NNTP.  The first is\r\nmainly modem-based and involves the normal charges for telephone\r\ncalls.  The second, NNTP, is the primary method for distributing news\r\nover the Internet.\r\n\r\nWith UUCP, news is stored in batches on a site until the\r\nneighbor calls to receive the articles, or the feed site happens to\r\ncall.  A list of groups which the neighbor wishes to receive is\r\nmaintained on the feed site.  The Cnews system compresses its batches,\r\nwhich can dramatically reduce the transmission time necessary for a\r\nrelatively heavy newsfeed.\r\n\r\nNNTP, on the other hand, offers a little more latitude with how news\r\nis sent.  The traditional store-and-forward method is, of course,\r\navailable.  Given the \"real-time\" nature of the Internet, though,\r\nother methods have been devised.  Programs now keep constant\r\nconnections with their news neighbors, sending news nearly\r\ninstantaneously, and can handle dozens of simultaneous feeds, both\r\nincoming and outgoing.\r\n\r\nThe transmission of a Usenet article is centered around the unique\r\nMessage-ID: header.  When an NNTP site offers an article to a\r\nneighbor, it says it has that specific Message ID.  If the neighbor\r\nfinds it hasn't received the article yet, it tells the feed to send it\r\nthrough; this is repeated for each and every article that's waiting\r\nfor the neighbor.  Using unique IDs helps prevent a system from\r\nreceiving five copies of an article from each of its five news\r\nneighbors, for example.\r\n\r\nFurther information on how Usenet works with relation to the various\r\ntransports is available in the documentation for the Cnews and NNTP\r\npackages, as well as in RFC-1036, the Standard for Interchange of\r\nUSENET Messages and RFC-977, Network News Transfer Protocol: A\r\nProposed Standard for the Stream-Based Transmission of News.  The\r\nRFCs do tend to be rather dry reading, particularly to the new user.\r\n\r\n\r\nMail Gateways\r\n\r\nA natural progression is for Usenet news and electronic mailing lists\r\nto somehow become merged---which they have, in the form of news\r\ngateways.  Many mailing lists are set up to \"reflect\" messages not\r\nonly to the readership of the list, but also into a newsgroup.\r\nLikewise, posts to a newsgroup can be sent to the moderator of the\r\nmailing list, or to the entire mailing list.  Some examples of this in\r\naction are comp.risks (the Risks Digest) and\r\ncomp.dcom.telecom (the Telecom Digest).\r\n\r\nThis method of propagating mailing list traffic has helped solve the\r\nproblem of a single message being delivered to a number of people at\r\nthe same site---instead, anyone can just subscribe to the group.\r\nAlso, mailing list maintenance is lowered substantially, since the\r\nmoderators don't have to be constantly removing and adding users to\r\nand from the list.  Instead, the people can read and not read the\r\nnewsgroup at their leisure.\r\n\r\nfrom \"Dear Emily Postnews\" by Brad Templeton\r\nUsenet \"Netiquette\"\r\n\r\nThere are many traditions with Usenet, not the least of which is\r\ndubbed netiquette---being polite and considerate of others.  If\r\nyou follow a few basic guidelines, you, and everyone that reads your\r\nposts, will be much happier in the long run.\r\n\r\n Signatures\r\n\r\nAt the end of most articles is a small blurb called a person's\r\nsignature.  In Unix this file is named .signature in the\r\nperson's login directory---it will vary for other operating systems.\r\nIt exists to provide information about how to get in touch with the\r\nperson posting the article, including their email address, phone\r\nnumber, address, or where they're located.  Even so, signatures have\r\nbecome the graffiti of computers.  People put song lyrics, pictures,\r\nphilosophical quotes, even advertisements in their \".sigs\".\r\n(Note, however, that advertising in your signature will more often\r\nthan not get you flamed until you take it out.)\r\n\r\nFour lines will suffice---more is just extra garbage for Usenet sites\r\nto carry along with your article, which is supposed to be the intended\r\nfocus of the reader.  Netiquette dictates limiting oneself to this\r\n\"quota\" of four---some people make signatures that are ten lines or\r\neven more, including elaborate ASCII drawings of their hand-written\r\nsignature or faces or even the space shuttle.  This is not\r\ncute, and will bother people to no end.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, it's not necessary to include your signature---if you\r\nforget to append it to an article, don't worry about it.  The\r\narticle's just as good as it ever would be, and contains everything\r\nyou should want to say.  Don't re-post the article just to include the\r\nsignature.\r\n\r\n Posting Personal Messages\r\n\r\nIf mail to a person doesn't make it through, avoid posting the message\r\nto a newsgroup.  Even if the likelihood of that person reading the\r\ngroup is very high, all of the other people reading the articles don't\r\ngive a whit what you have to say to Jim Morrison.  Simply wait for the\r\nperson to post again and double-check the address, or get in touch\r\nwith your system administrator and see if it's a problem with local\r\nemail delivery.  It may also turn out that their site is down or is\r\nhaving problems, in which case it's just necessary to wait until\r\nthings return to normal before contacting Jim.\r\n\r\n Posting Mail\r\n\r\nIn the interests of privacy, it's considered extremely bad taste to post\r\nany email that someone may have sent, unless they explicitly give you\r\npermission to redistribute it.  While the legal issues can be heavily\r\ndebated, most everyone agrees that email should be treated as anything\r\none would receive via normal snailmail, {The slang for the  normal land and air\r\npostal service.} , with all of the assumed rights that are carried with it.\r\n\r\n Test Messages\r\n\r\nMany people, particularly new users, want to try out posting before\r\nactually taking part in discussions.  Often the mechanics of getting\r\nmessages out is the most difficult part of Usenet.  To this end,\r\nmany, many users find it necessary to post their tests to \"normal\"\r\ngroups (for example, news.admin or comp.mail.misc).  This is\r\nconsidered a major netiquette faux pas in the Usenet world. There are\r\na number of groups available, called test groups, that exist solely\r\nfor the purpose of trying out a news system, reader, or even new\r\nsignature.  They include\r\n\r\nalt.test\r\ngnu.gnusenet.test\r\nmisc.test\r\n\r\nsome of which will generate auto-magic replies to your posts to\r\nlet you know they made it through.  There are certain denizens of\r\nUsenet that frequent the test groups to help new users out.  They\r\nrespond to the posts, often including the article so the poster can\r\nsee how it got to the person's site.  Also, many regional hierarchies\r\nhave test groups, like phl.test in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nBy all means, experiment and test---just do it in its proper place.\r\n\r\n Famous People Appearing\r\n\r\nEvery once in a while, someone says that a celebrity is accessible\r\nthrough \"The Net\"; or, even more entertaining, an article is forged\r\nto appear to be coming from that celebrity.  One example is Stephen\r\nSpielberg---the rec.arts.movies readership was in an uproar for\r\ntwo weeks following a couple of posts supposedly made by Mr.\r\nSpielberg.  (Some detective work revealed it to be a hoax.)\r\n\r\nThere are a few well-known people that are acquainted with\r\nUsenet and computers in general---but the overwhelming majority are\r\njust normal people.  One should act with skepticism whenever a notable\r\npersonality is \"seen\" in a newsgroup.\r\n\r\n Summaries\r\n\r\nAuthors of articles occasionally say that readers should reply by\r\nmail and they'll summarize.  Accordingly, readers should do just\r\nthat---reply via mail.  Responding with a followup article to such an\r\narticle defeats the intention of the author.  She, in a few days,\r\nwill post one article containing the highlights of the responses she\r\nreceived.  By following up to the whole group, the author may not\r\nread what you have to say.\r\n\r\nWhen creating a summary of the replies to a post, try to make it as\r\nreader-friendly as possible.  Avoid just putting all of the messages\r\nreceived into one big file.  Rather, take some time and edit the\r\nmessages into a form that contains the essential information that\r\nother readers would be interested in.\r\n\r\nAlso, sometimes people will respond but request to remain anonymous\r\n(one example is the employees of a corporation that feel the\r\ninformation's not proprietary, but at the same time want to protect\r\nthemselves from political backlash).  Summaries should honor this\r\nrequest accordingly by listing the From: address as\r\nanonymous or (Address withheld by request).\r\n\r\n Quoting\r\n\r\nWhen following up to an article, many newsreaders provide the facility\r\nto quote the original article with each line prefixed by >\r\n, as in\r\n\r\nIn article <1232@foo.bar.com>, sharon@foo.bar.com wrote:\r\n> I agree, I think that basketweaving's really catching on,\r\n> particularly in Pennsylvania.  Here's a list of every person\r\n> in PA that currently engages in it publicly:\r\n               line ... etc ...\r\n\r\nThis is a severe example (potentially a horribly long article), but\r\nproves a point.  When you quote another person, edit out whatever\r\nisn't directly applicable to your reply. {But not  changing their\r\nwords, of course. } This gives the reader of the new article a better\r\nidea of what points you were addressing.  By including the entire\r\narticle, you'll only annoy those reading it.  Also, signatures in the\r\noriginal aren't necessary; the readers already know who wrote it (by\r\nthe attribution).\r\n\r\nAvoid being tedious with responses---rather than pick apart an\r\narticle, address it in parts or as a whole.  Addressing practically\r\neach and every word in an article only proves that the person\r\nresponding has absolutely nothing better to do with his time.\r\n\r\nIf a \"war\" starts (insults and personal comments get thrown back\r\nand forth), take it into email---exchange email with the person\r\nyou're arguing with.  No one enjoys watching people bicker\r\nincessantly.\r\n\r\n Crossposting\r\n\r\nThe Newsgroups: line isn't limited to just one group---an\r\narticle can be posted in a list of groups.  For instance, the line\r\n\r\n      Newsgroups: sci.space,comp.simulation\r\n\r\nposts the article to both the groups sci.space and\r\ncomp.simulation. It's usually safe to crosspost to up to three\r\nor four groups.  To list more than that is considered \"excessive\r\nnoise.\"\r\n\r\nIt's also suggested that if an article is crossposted a\r\nFollowup-To: header be included.  It should name the group to\r\nwhich all additional discussion should be directed to.  For the above\r\nexample a possible Followup-To: would be\r\n\r\n      Followup-To: sci.space\r\n\r\nwhich would make all followups automatically be posted to just\r\nsci.space, rather than both sci.space and comp.simulation.  If every\r\nresponse made with a newsreader's \"followup\" command should go to\r\nthe person posting the article no matter what, there's also a\r\nmechanism worked in to accommodate.  The Followup-To: header should\r\ncontain the single word poster:\r\n\r\n      Followup-To: poster\r\n\r\nCertain newsreaders will use this to sense that a reply should never\r\nbe posted back onto The Net.  This is often used with questions that\r\nwill yield a summary of information later, a vote, or an\r\nadvertisement.\r\n\r\n Recent News\r\n\r\nOne should avoid posting \"recent\" events---sports scores, a plane\r\ncrash, or whatever people will see on the evening news or read in the\r\nmorning paper.  By the time the article has propagated across all of\r\nUsenet, the \"news\" value of the article will have become stale.\r\n(This is one case for the argument that Usenet news is a misnomer.\r\n{Note that the Clarinet News service (Clarinet) offers news items in\r\na Usenet format as a precise alternative to the morning paper,  et.\r\nal.)\r\n\r\n Quality of Postings\r\n\r\nHow you write and present yourself in your articles is important.  If\r\nyou have terrible spelling, keep a dictionary near by.  If you have\r\ntrouble with grammar and punctuation, try to get a book on English\r\ngrammar and composition (found in many bookstores and at garage\r\nsales).  By all means pay attention to what you say---it makes you who\r\nyou are on The Net.\r\n\r\nLikewise, try to be clear in what you ask.  Ambiguous or vague\r\nquestions often lead to no response at all, leaving the poster\r\ndiscouraged.  Give as much essential information as you feel is\r\nnecessary to let people help you, but keep it within limits.  For\r\ninstance, you should probably include the operating system of your\r\ncomputer in the post if it's needed, but don't tell everybody what\r\nperipherals you have hanging off of it.\r\n\r\n Useful Subjects\r\n\r\nThe Subject: line of an article is what will first attract\r\npeople to read it---if it's vague or doesn't describe what's contained\r\nwithin, no one will read the article.  At the same time,\r\nSubject: lines that're too wordy tend to be irritating.  For\r\nexample:\r\n\r\n\r\n Good\r\nSubject: Building Emacs on a Sun Sparc under 4.1\r\n\r\n Good\r\nSubject: Tryin' to find Waldo in NJ.\r\n\r\n Bad\r\nSubject: I can't get emacs to work !!!\r\n\r\n Bad\r\nSubject: I'm desperately in search of the honorable Mr. Waldo in the state\r\nof...\r\n\r\nSimply put, try to think of what will best help the reader when he or\r\nshe encounters your article in a newsreading session.\r\n\r\n Tone of Voice\r\n\r\nSince common computers can't portray the inflection or tone in a\r\nperson's voice, how articles are worded can directly affect the\r\nresponse to them.  If you say\r\n\r\n      Anybody using a Vic-20 should go buy themselves a life.\r\n\r\nyou'll definitely get some responses---telling you to take a leap.\r\nRather than be inflammatory, phrase your articles in a way that\r\nrationally expresses your opinion, like\r\n\r\n      What're the practical uses of a Vic-20 these days?\r\n\r\nwhich presents yourself as a much more level-headed individual.\r\n\r\nAlso, what case (upper or lower) you use can indicate how you're\r\ntrying to speak---netiquette dictates that if you USE ALL CAPITAL\r\nLETTERS, people will think you're \"shouting.\"  Write as you would in\r\na normal letter to a friend, following traditional rules of English\r\n(or whatever language you happen to speak).\r\n\r\n Computer Religion\r\n\r\nNo matter what kind of computer a person is using, theirs is always\r\nthe best and most efficient of them all.  Posting articles\r\nasking questions like What computer should I buy? An Atari ST or an\r\nAmiga? will lead only to fervent arguments over the merits and\r\ndrawbacks of each brand.  Don't even ask The Net---go to a local user\r\ngroup, or do some research of your own like reading some magazine\r\nreviews.  Trying to say one computer is somehow better than another is\r\na moot point.\r\n\r\nThe Anatomy of an Article\r\n\r\nFrequently Asked Questions\r\n\r\nA number of groups include Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) lists,\r\nwhich give the answers to questions or points that have been raised\r\ntime and time again in a newsgroup.  They're intended to help cut\r\ndown on the redundant traffic in a group.  For example, in the\r\nnewsgroup alt.tv.simpsons, one recurring question is Did you notice\r\nthat there's a different blackboard opening at the beginning of every\r\nSimpsons episode?  As a result, it's part of the FAQ for that group.\r\n\r\nUsually, FAQ lists are posted at the beginning of each month, and are\r\nset to expire one month later (when, supposedly, the next FAQ will be\r\npublished).  Nearly every FAQ is also crossposted to news.answers,\r\nwhich is used as a Usenet repository for them.\r\n\r\n The Pit-Manager Archive\r\n\r\nMIT, with Jonathan Kamens, has graciously dedicated a machine to the\r\narchiving and storage of the various periodic postings that are\r\npeppered throughout the various Usenet groups. To access them, FTP to\r\nthe system pit-manager.mit.edu and look in the directory\r\n/pub/usenet.\r\n\r\n\"Be it true or false, so it be news.\"\r\nBen Jonson, News from the New World\r\n\r\n-----\r\n Telnet\r\n\r\nTelnet is the main Internet protocol for creating a connection\r\nwith a remote machine.  It gives the user the opportunity to be on one\r\ncomputer system and do work on another, which may be across the street\r\nor thousands of miles away.  Where modems are limited, in the majority,\r\nby the quality of telephone lines and a single connection, telnet\r\nprovides a connection that's error-free and nearly always faster than\r\nthe latest conventional modems.\r\n\r\nUsing Telnet\r\n\r\nAs with FTP (Anonymous FTP), the actual command for negotiating a telnet\r\nconnection varies from system to system.  The most common is\r\ntelnet itself, though.  It takes the form of:\r\n\r\ntelnet somewhere.domain\r\n\r\nTo be safe, we'll use your local system as a working example.  By now,\r\nyou hopefully know your site's domain name.  If not, ask or try\r\nto figure it out.  You'll not get by without it.\r\n\r\nTo open the connection, type\r\n\r\ntelnet your.system.name\r\n\r\nIf the system were wubba.cs.widener.edu, for example, the\r\ncommand would look like\r\n\r\ntelnet wubba.cs.widener.edu\r\n\r\nThe system will respond with something similar to\r\n\r\nTrying 147.31.254.999...\r\nConnected to wubba.cs.widener.edu.\r\nEscape character is '^]'.\r\n\r\nThe escape character, in this example ^] (Control-]), is the\r\ncharacter that will let you go back to the local system to close the\r\nconnection, suspend it, etc.  To close this connection, the user\r\nwould type ^], and respond to the telnet> prompt with the command\r\nclose.  Local documentation should be checked for information on\r\nspecific commands, functions, and escape character that can be used.\r\n\r\n Telnet Ports\r\n\r\nMany telnet clients also include a third option, the port on\r\nwhich the connection should take place.  Normally, port 23 is the\r\ndefault telnet port; the user never has to think about it.  But\r\nsometimes it's desirable to telnet to a different port on a system,\r\nwhere there may be a service available, or to aid in debugging a\r\nproblem.  Using\r\n\r\ntelnet somewhere.domain port\r\n\r\nwill connect the user to the given port on the system\r\nsomewhere.domain.  Many libraries use this port method to offer their\r\nfacilities to the general Internet community; other services are also\r\navailable.  For instance, one would type\r\n\r\ntelnet martini.eecs.umich.edu 3000\r\n\r\nto connect to the geographic server at the University of Michigan\r\n(Geographic Server).  Other such port connections follow the\r\nsame usage.\r\n\r\nPublicly Accessible Libraries\r\n\r\nOver the last several years, most university libraries have switched\r\nfrom a manual (card) catalog system to computerized library catalogs.\r\nThe automated systems provide users with easily accessible and\r\nup-to-date information about the books available in these libraries.\r\nThis has been further improved upon with the advent of local area\r\nnetworks, dialup modems, and wide area networks.  Now many of us can\r\ncheck on our local library's holdings or that of a library halfway\r\naround the world!\r\n\r\nMany, many institutions of higher learning have made their library\r\ncatalogs available for searching by anyone on the Internet.  They\r\ninclude Boston University, the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries\r\n(CARL), and London University King's College.\r\n\r\nTo include a listing of some of the existing sites would not only be\r\nfar too long for this document, it would soon be out of date.\r\nInstead, several lists are being maintained and are available either\r\nby mail or via FTP.  Also, the Internet Resource Guide (IRG) also\r\ndescribes a few libraries that are accessible---IRG for further\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nArt St. George and  Ron Larsen are maintaining a list of\r\nInternet-accessible libraries and databases often referred to as\r\n\"the St. George directory.\"  It began with only library catalogs\r\nbut has expanded to include sections on campus-wide information\r\nsystems, and even bulletin board systems that are not on the\r\nInternet.  The library catalog sections are divided into those that\r\nare free, those that charge, and international (i.e. non-U.S.)\r\ncatalogs; they are arranged by state, province, or country within\r\neach section.  There is also a section giving dialup information for\r\nsome of the library catalogs. It's available for FTP (Anonymous FTP)\r\non nic.cerf.net in the directory\r\ncerfnet/cerfnet_info/library_catalog.  The file internet-catalogs has\r\na date suffix; check for the most current date.  The information is\r\nupdated periodically.\r\n\r\nBilly Barron, Systems Manager at the University of North Texas,\r\nproduces a directory as an aid to his user community.  It complements\r\nthe St. George guide by providing a standard format for all systems\r\nwhich lists the Internet address, login instructions, the system\r\nvendor, and logoff information.  The arrangement is alphabetic by\r\norganization name.  It's available for FTP on vaxb.acs.unt.edu in the\r\nsubdirectory library as the file libraries.txt.\r\n\r\nFor announcements of new libraries being available and discussion on\r\nrelated topics, consult the Usenet newsgroup\r\ncomp.internet.library (Usenet News to learn how to read\r\nnews).\r\n\r\nBulletin Board Systems\r\n\r\nThe Cleveland Freenet\r\n\r\nFreenets are open-access, free, community computer systems.  One such\r\nsystem is the Cleveland Freenet, sponsored by CWRU (Case Western\r\nReserve University).  Anyone and everyone is welcome to join and take\r\npart in the exciting project---that of a National Telecomputing Public\r\nNetwork, where everyone benefits.  There's no charge for the\r\nregistration process and no charge to use the system.\r\n\r\nTo register, telnet to any one of\r\n\r\nfreenet-in-a.cwru.edu\r\nfreenet-in-b.cwru.edu\r\nfreenet-in-c.cwru.edu\r\n\r\nAfter you're connected, choose the entry on the menu that signifies\r\nyou're a guest user.  Another menu will follow; select Apply for\r\nan account, and you'll be well on your way to being a FreeNet member.\r\n\r\nYou will need to fill out a form and send it to them through the\r\nPostal Service---your login id and password will be created in a few\r\ndays.  At that point you're free to use the system as you wish.  They\r\nprovide multi-user chat, email, Usenet news, and a variety of other\r\nthings to keep you occupied for hours on end.\r\n\r\nDirectories\r\n\r\nThere are a few systems that are maintained to provide the Internet\r\ncommunity with access to lists of information---users, organizations,\r\netc.  They range from fully dedicated computers with access to papers\r\nand research results, to a system to find out about the faculty\r\nmembers of a university.\r\n\r\n Knowbot\r\n\r\nKnowbot is a \"master directory\" that contains email address\r\ninformation from the NIC WHOIS database (Whois), the PSI White\r\nPages Pilot Project, the NYSERNET X.500 database and MCI Mail.  Most\r\nof these services are email registries themselves, but Knowbot\r\nprovides a very comfortable way to access all of them in one place.\r\nTelnet to nri.reston.va.us on port 185.\r\n\r\n White Pages\r\n\r\nPSI maintains a directory of information on individuals.  It will\r\nlist the person's name, organization, and email address if it is\r\ngiven. Telnet to wp.psi.net and log in as fred.  The White Pages\r\nProject also includes an interface to use Xwindows remotely.\r\n\r\n Faculty and Staff Listings\r\n\r\nMany universities offer access to information on current faculty and\r\nstaff.  Included are:\r\n\r\nCornell          Telnet to cuinfo.cornell.edu on port 3000.\r\nNC State         Telnet to ccvax1.cc.ncsu.edu and log in as info.\r\nRutgers          Telnet to hangout.rutgers.edu on port 98.\r\nU of Maryland    Telnet to umail.umd.edu and log in as lookup.\r\nUNC Chapel Hill  Telnet to info.acs.unc.edu and log in as info.\r\nYale             Telnet to yalevm.ycc.yale.edu on port 300.\r\n\r\nDatabases\r\n\r\nFor information on database services, Commercial Databases.\r\nNot all databases on the Internet require payment for use, though.\r\nThere do exist some, largely research-driven databases, which are\r\npublicly accessible.  New ones spring up regularly.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about the databases in this section, contact the\r\npeople directly responsible for them.  Their areas of concentration\r\nand the software used to implement them are widely disparate, and are\r\nprobably beyond the author's expertise.  Also, don't forget to check\r\nwith your local library---the reference librarian there can provide\r\ninformation on conventional resources, and possibly even those\r\navailable over the Internet (they are becoming more common).\r\n\r\n Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries (CARL)\r\n\r\nThe Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries (CARL), in association\r\nwith CARL Systems Inc., operates a public access catalog of services.\r\nOffered are a number of library databases, including searches for\r\ngovernment periodicals, book reviews, indices for current articles,\r\nand access to to other library databases around the country.  Other\r\nservices are available to CARL members including an online\r\nencyclopedia.  Telnet to pac.carl.org, or write to help@carl.org for\r\nmore details.\r\n\r\n PENpages\r\n\r\nPENpages is an agriculturally-oriented database administered by\r\nPennsylvania State University.  Information entered into PENpages is\r\nprovided by numerous sources including the Pennsylvania Dept. of\r\nAgriculture, Rutgers University, and Penn State.  Easy-to-use menus\r\nguide users to information ranging from cattle and agricultural\r\nprices to current weather information, from health information to\r\nagricultural news from around the nation.  A keyword search option\r\nalso allows users to search the database for related information and\r\narticles.  The database is updated daily, and a listing of most\r\nrecent additions is displayed after login.  Telnet to psupen.psu.edu\r\nand log in as the user PNOTPA.\r\n\r\n Clemson Univ. Forestry & Agricultural Network\r\n\r\nClemson maintains a database similar to PENpages in content, but the\r\ninformation provided tends to be localized to the Southeastern United\r\nStates.  A menu-driven database offers queries involving the weather,\r\nfood, family, and human resources.  Telnet to eureka.clemson.edu and\r\nlog in as PUBLIC.  You need to be on a good VT100 emulator (or a real\r\nVT terminal).\r\n\r\n University of Maryland Info Database\r\n\r\nThe Computer Science department of the University of Maryland\r\nmaintains a repository of information on a wide variety of topics.\r\nThey wish to give a working example of how network technology can\r\n(and should) provide as much information as possible to those who use\r\nit. Telnet to info.umd.edu and log in as info.  The information\r\ncontained in the database is accessible through a screen-oriented\r\ninterface, and everything therein is available via anonymous FTP.\r\n\r\nThere is a mailing list used to discuss the UMD Info Database,\r\nwelcoming suggestions for new information, comments on the interface\r\nthe system provides, and other related topics.

As they gain wide-spread use, some methods become\r\nnear-standard (or actual written standard) tools for Internet users to\r\ntake advantage of.  A few are detailed here; there are undoubtedly\r\nothers, and new ideas spring up all the time.  An active user of the\r\nInternet will discover most of the more common ones in time.  Usually,\r\nthese services are free.  Commercial Services for applications\r\nthat are commercially available over the Internet.\r\n\r\nUsenet is often used to announce a new service or capability on\r\nthe Internet.  In particular, the groups comp.archives and\r\ncomp.protocols.tcp-ip are good places to look.  Information\r\nwill drift into other areas as word spreads.  Usenet News for\r\ninformation on reading news.\r\n\r\nFinger\r\n\r\nOn many systems there exists the finger command, which yield\r\ninformation about each user that's currently logged in.  This command\r\nalso has extensions for use over the Internet, as well.  Under normal\r\ncircumstances, the command is simply finger for a summary of who's\r\nlogged into the local system, or finger username for specific\r\ninformation about a user. It's also possible to go one step further\r\nand go onto the network.  The general usage is\r\n\r\nfinger @hostname\r\n\r\nTo see who's currently logged in at Widener University, for instance, use\r\n\r\n% finger @cs.widener.edu\r\n[cs.widener.edu]\r\nLogin       Name              TTY Idle    When            Where\r\nbrendan  Brendan Kehoe         p0      Fri 02:14  tattoo.cs.widene\r\nsven     Sven Heinicke         p1      Fri 04:16  xyplex3.cs.widen\r\n\r\n\r\nTo find out about a certain user, they can be fingered specifically\r\n(and need not be logged in):\r\n\r\n% finger bart@cs.widener.edu\r\n[cs.widener.edu]\r\nLogin name: bart                        In real life: Bart Simpson\r\nDirectory: /home/springfield/bart       Shell: /bin/underachiever\r\nAffiliation: Brother of Lisa            Home System: channel29.fox.org\r\nLast login Thu May 23 12:14 (EDT) on ttyp6 from channel29.fox.org.\r\nNo unread mail\r\nProject: To become a \"fluff\" cartoon character.\r\nPlan:\r\nDon't have a cow, man.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease realize that some sites are very security conscious, and need\r\nto restrict the information about their systems and users available\r\nto the outside world.  To that end, they often block finger requests\r\nfrom outside sites---so don't be surprised if fingering a computer or\r\na user returns with Connection refused.\r\n\r\nInternet Relay Chat\r\n\r\nThe Lamont View Server System\r\nOn lamont.ldgo.columbia.edu in pub/gb.tar.Z.\r\n\r\nPing\r\n\r\nThe ping command allows the user to check if another system is\r\ncurrently \"up\" and running.  The general form of the command\r\nis ping system. {The usage will, again, vary.}\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\nping cs.widener.edu\r\n\r\nwill tell you if the main machine in Widener University's Computer\r\nScience lab is currently online (we certainly hope so!).\r\n\r\nMany implementations of ping also include an option to let you\r\nsee how fast a link is running (to give you some idea of the load on\r\nthe network).  For example:\r\n\r\n% ping -s cs.swarthmore.edu\r\nPING cs.swarthmore.edu: 56 data bytes\r\n64 bytes from 130.58.68.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=251 time=66 ms\r\n64 bytes from 130.58.68.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=251 time=45 ms\r\n64 bytes from 130.58.68.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=251 time=46 ms\r\n^C\r\n--- cs.swarthmore.edu ping statistics ---\r\n3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss\r\nround-trip min/avg/max = 45/52/66 ms\r\n\r\n\r\nThis case tells us that for cs.swarthmore.edu it takes about 46\r\nmilliseconds for a packet to go from Widener to Swarthmore College and\r\nback again.  It also gives the average and worst-case speeds, and any\r\npacket loss that may have occurred (e.g. because of network\r\ncongestion).\r\n\r\nWhile ping generally doesn't hurt network performance, you\r\nshouldn't use it too often---usually once or twice will leave\r\nyou relatively sure of the other system's state.\r\n\r\nTalk\r\n\r\nSometimes email is clumsy and difficult to manage when one really\r\nneeds to have an interactive conversation.  The Internet provides for\r\nthat as well, in the form of talk. Two users can literally see\r\neach other type across thousands of miles.\r\n\r\nTo talk with Bart Simpson at Widener, one would type\r\n\r\ntalk bart@@cs.widener.edu\r\n\r\nwhich would cause a message similar to the following to be displayed\r\non Bart's terminal:\r\n\r\nMessage from Talk_Daemon@cs.widener.edu at 21:45 ...\r\ntalk: connection requested by joe@ee.someplace.edu\r\ntalk: respond with:  talk joe@ee.someplace.edu\r\n\r\nBart would, presumably, respond by typing talk joe@ee.someplace.edu.\r\nThey could then chat about whatever they wished, with instantaneous\r\nresponse time, rather than the write-and-wait style of email.  To\r\nleave talk, on many systems one would type Ctrl-C (hold down\r\nthe Control key and press C).  Check local documentation to be sure.\r\n\r\nThere are two different versions of talk in common use today.  The\r\nfirst, dubbed \"old talk,\" is supported by a set of Unix systems\r\n(most notably, those currently sold by Sun).  The second, ntalk\r\n(aka \"new talk\"), is more of the standard.  If, when attempting to\r\ntalk with another user, it responds with an error about protocol\r\nfamilies, odds are the incompatibilities between versions of talk is\r\nthe culprit.  It's up to the system administrators of sites which use\r\nthe old talk to install ntalk for their users.\r\n\r\nWide Area Information Servers (WAIS)\r\n\r\nThe WHOIS Database\r\n\r\nThe main WHOIS database is run at the Network Information Center\r\n(NIC). The whois command will let you search a database of every\r\nregistered domain (e.g. mit.edu) and of registered users. It's\r\nprimarily used by system postmasters or listowners to find the Points\r\nof Contact for a site, to let them know of a problem or contact them\r\nfor one reason or another.  You can also find out their postal\r\naddress. For example:\r\n\r\n% whois mit.edu\r\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) MIT.EDU             18.72.2.1\r\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT-DOM)                   MIT.EDU\r\n\r\nNote that there are two entries for mit.edu; we'll go for the\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n% whois mit-dom\r\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT-DOM)\r\nCambridge, MA 02139\r\n\r\nDomain Name: MIT.EDU\r\n\r\nAdministrative Contact, Technical Contact, Zone Contact:\r\nSchiller, Jeffrey I.

The completed\r\nform should be mailed to registrar@nic.ddn.mil.\r\n\r\n Other Uses of WHOIS\r\n\r\nAlso, many educational sites run WHOIS servers of their own, to offer\r\ninformation about people who may be currently on the staff or\r\nattending the institution.  To specify a WHOIS server, many\r\nimplementations include some sort of option or qualifier---in VMS\r\nunder MultiNet, it's /HOST, in Unix -h.  To receive\r\ninformation about using the Stanford server, one might use the command\r\n\r\nwhois -h stanford.edu help\r\n\r\nA large list of systems offering WHOIS services is being maintained by\r\nMatt Power of MIT (mhpower@stan.mit.edu).  It is available via\r\nanonymous FTP from sipb.mit.edu, in the directory\r\npub/whois.

Most people assume that everyone's\r\nfamiliar with them, and they require no additional explanation.  If\r\nonly that were true!\r\n\r\nThis section addresses a few topics that are commonly encountered and\r\nasked about as a new user explores Cyberspace.  Some of them are\r\ndirectly related to how the networks are run today; other points are\r\nsimply interesting to read about.\r\n\r\nThe Internet Worm\r\n\r\nfrom a letter by Severo M. Ornstein, in ACM June 89 Vol32 No6\r\nand the appeal notice\r\n\r\nOn November 2, 1988, Robert Morris, Jr., a graduate student in\r\nComputer Science at Cornell, wrote an experimental, self-replicating,\r\nself-propagating program called a worm and injected it into the\r\nInternet.  He chose to release it from MIT, to disguise the fact that\r\nthe worm came from Cornell.  Morris soon discovered that the program\r\nwas replicating and reinfecting machines at a much faster rate than\r\nhe had anticipated---there was a bug.  Ultimately, many machines at\r\nlocations around the country either crashed or became \"catatonic.\"\r\nWhen Morris realized what was happening, he contacted a friend at\r\nHarvard to discuss a solution.  Eventually, they sent an anonymous\r\nmessage from Harvard over the network, instructing programmers how to\r\nkill the worm and prevent reinfection.  However, because the network\r\nroute was clogged, this message did not get through until it was too\r\nlate.  Computers were affected at many sites, including universities,\r\nmilitary sites, and medical research facilities.  The estimated cost\r\nof dealing with the worm at each installation ranged from $200 to\r\nmore than $53,000. {Derived in part from a letter by Severo M.\r\nOrnstein, in the Communications of the ACM, Vol 32 No 6, June 1989.}\r\n\r\nThe program took advantage of a hole in the debug mode of the Unix\r\nsendmail program, which runs on a system and waits for other systems\r\nto connect to it and give it email, and a hole in the finger daemon\r\nfingerd, which serves finger requests (Finger).  People at the\r\nUniversity of California at Berkeley and MIT had copies of the\r\nprogram and were actively disassembling it (returning the program\r\nback into its source form) to try to figure out how it worked.\r\n\r\nTeams of programmers worked non-stop to come up with at least a\r\ntemporary fix, to prevent the continued spread of the worm.  After\r\nabout twelve hours, the team at Berkeley came up with steps that\r\nwould help retard the spread of the virus.  Another method was also\r\ndiscovered at Purdue and widely published.  The information didn't\r\nget out as quickly as it could have, however, since so many sites had\r\ncompletely disconnected themselves from the network.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days, things slowly began to return to normalcy and\r\neveryone wanted to know who had done it all.  Morris was later named\r\nin The New York Times as the author (though this hadn't yet been\r\nofficially proven, there was a substantial body of evidence pointing\r\nto Morris).\r\n\r\nRobert T. Morris was convicted of violating the computer Fraud and\r\nAbuse Act (Title 18), and sentenced to three years of probation, 400\r\nhours of community service, a fine of $10,050, and the costs of his\r\nsupervision.  His appeal, filed in December, 1990, was rejected the\r\nfollowing March.\r\n\r\nThe Cuckoo's Egg\r\n\r\nFirst in an article entitled \"Stalking the Wily Hacker,\" and later\r\nin the book The Cuckoo's Egg, Clifford Stoll detailed his experiences\r\ntrying to track down someone breaking into a system at Lawrence\r\nBerkeley Laboratory in California. {See the bibliography for full\r\ncitations.}\r\n\r\nA 75-cent discrepancy in the Lab's accounting records led Stoll on a\r\nchase through California, Virginia, and Europe to end up in a small\r\napartment in Hannover, West Germany.  Stoll dealt with many levels of\r\nbureaucracy and red tape, and worked with the FBI, the CIA, and the\r\nGerman Bundespost trying to track his hacker down.\r\n\r\nThe experiences of Stoll, and particularly his message in speaking\r\nengagements, have all pointed out the dire need for communication\r\nbetween parties on a network of networks.  The only way everyone can\r\npeacefully co-exist in Cyberspace is by ensuring rapid recognition of\r\nany existing problems.\r\n\r\nOrganizations\r\n\r\nThe indomitable need for humans to congregate and share their common\r\ninterests is also present in the computing world.  User groups\r\nexist around the world, where people share ideas and experiences.\r\nSimilarly, there are organizations which are one step \"above\" user\r\ngroups; that is to say, they exist to encourage or promote an idea or\r\nset of ideas, rather than support a specific computer or application\r\nof computers.\r\n\r\n The Association for Computing Machinery\r\n\r\nThe Association for Computing Machinery (the ACM) was founded in\r\n1947, immediately after Eckert and Mauchly unveiled one of the first\r\nelectronic computers, the ENIAC, in 1946.  Since then, the ACM has\r\ngrown by leaps and bounds, becoming one of the leading educational\r\nand scientific societies in the computer industry.\r\n\r\nThe ACM's stated purposes are:\r\n\r\nTo advance the sciences and arts of information processing;\r\n\r\nTo promote the free interchange of information about the sciences and\r\narts of information processing both among specialists and among the\r\npublic;\r\n\r\nTo develop and maintain the integrity and competence of individuals\r\nengaged in the practices of the sciences and arts of information\r\nprocessing.\r\n\r\nMembership in the ACM has grown from seventy-eight in September, 1947,\r\nto over 77,000 today.  There are local chapters around the world, and\r\nmany colleges and universities endorse student chapters.  Lecturers\r\nfrequent these meetings, which tend to be one step above the normal\r\n\"user group\" gathering.  A large variety of published material is\r\nalso available at discounted prices for members of the association.\r\n\r\nThe ACM has a number of Special Interest Groups (SIGs) that\r\nconcentrate on a certain area of computing, ranging from graphics to\r\nthe Ada programming language to security.  Each of the SIGs also\r\npublishes its own newsletter.  There is a Usenet group, comp.org.acm,\r\nfor the discussion of ACM topics.

It\r\ntraces its history to the fall of 1981, when several researchers in\r\nPalo Alto, California, organized a lunch meeting to discuss their\r\nshared concerns about the connection between computing and the\r\nnuclear arms race.  Out of that meeting and the discussions which\r\nfollowed, CPSR was born, and has been active ever since. {This\r\nsection is part of the CPSR's letter to prospective members.}\r\n\r\nThe national CPSR program focuses on the following project areas:\r\n\r\n\r\nReliability and Risk  This area reflects on the concern that\r\noverreliance on computing technology can lead to unacceptable risks\r\nto society.  It includes, but isn't limited to, work in analyzing\r\nmilitary systems such as SDI.\r\n\r\nCivil Liberties and Privacy  This project is concerned with such\r\ntopics as the FBI National Crime Information Center, the growing use\r\nof databases by both government and private industry, the right of\r\naccess to public information, extension of First Amendment rights to\r\nelectronic communication, and establishing legal protections for\r\nprivacy of computerized information.\r\n\r\nComputers in the Workplace  The CPSR Workplace Project has\r\nconcentrated its attention on the design of software for the\r\nworkplace, and particularly on the philosophy of \"participatory\r\ndesign,\" in which software designers work together with users to\r\nensure that systems meet the actual needs of that workplace.\r\n\r\nThe 21st Century Project This is a coalition with other\r\nprofessional organizations working towards redirecting national\r\nresearch priorities from concentrating on military issues to\r\nanticipating and dealing with future problems as science and\r\ntechnology enter the next century.\r\n\r\nFor more information on the CPSR, contact them at:\r\n\r\nComputer Professionals for Social Responsibility\r\nP.O.

It is dedicated to eliminating\r\nrestrictions on copying, redistributing, and modifying software.\r\n\r\nThe word \"free\" in their name does not refer to price; it refers to\r\nfreedom.  First, the freedom to copy a program and redistribute it to\r\nyour neighbors, so that they can use it as well as you.  Second, the\r\nfreedom to change a program, so that you can control it instead of it\r\ncontrolling you; for this, the source code must be made available to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation works to provide these freedoms by developing free\r\ncompatible replacements for proprietary software.  Specifically, they\r\nare putting together a complete, integrated software system called\r\n\"GNU\" that is upward-compatible with Unix. {As an aside, the editor\r\nof the GNU project, emacs, contains a built-in LISP interpreter and a\r\nlarge part of its functionality is written in LISP. The name GNU is\r\nitself recursive (the mainstay of the LISP language); it stands for\r\n\"Gnu's Not Unix.\"}\r\n\r\nWhen it is released, everyone will be permitted to copy it and\r\ndistribute it to others.  In addition, it will be distributed with\r\nsource code, so you will be able to learn about operating systems by\r\nreading it, to port it to your own machine, and to exchange the\r\nchanges with others.\r\n\r\nFor more information on the Free Software Foundation and the status of\r\nthe GNU Project, or for a list of the current tasks that still need to\r\nbe done, write to gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu.\r\n\r\n The IEEE\r\n\r\nNeed IEEE...\r\n\r\n The League for Programming Freedom\r\n\r\nThe League for Programming Freedom is a grass-roots organization of\r\nprofessors, students, businessmen, programmers and users dedicated to\r\n\"bringing back\" the freedom to write programs, which they contend\r\nhas been lost over the past number years.  The League is not opposed\r\nto the legal system that Congress intended--copyright on individual\r\nprograms. Their aim is to reverse the recent changes made by judges in\r\nresponse to special interests, often explicitly rejecting the public\r\ninterest principles of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe League works to abolish the new monopolies by publishing articles,\r\ntalking with public officials, boycotting egregious offenders, and in\r\nthe future may intervene in court cases.  On May 24, 1989, the League\r\npicketed Lotus headquarters because of their lawsuits, and then\r\nagain on August 2, 1990.  These marches stimulated widespread media\r\ncoverage for the issue.  They welcome suggestions for other\r\nactivities, as well as help in carrying them out.\r\n\r\nFor information on the League and how to join, write to\r\n\r\nLeague for Programming Freedom\r\n1 Kendall Square #143\r\nP.O.

To \"keep current,\" one should\r\nread the various trade magazines and newspapers, or frequent the\r\nnetworking-oriented newsgroups of Usenet.  If possible, attend trade\r\nshows and symposia like Usenix, Interop, et. al.\r\n\r\n ISDN\r\n\r\n NREN\r\n\r\nThe National Research and Education Network (NREN) is a five-year\r\nproject approved by Congress in the Fall of 1991.  It's intended to\r\ncreate a national electronic \"super-highway.\"  The NREN will be 50\r\ntimes faster than the fastest available networks (at the time of this\r\nwriting).  Proponents of the NREN claim it will be possible to\r\ntransfer the equivalent of the entire text of the Encyclopedia\r\nBritannica in one second.  Further information, including the\r\noriginal text of the bill presented by Senator Al Gore (D--TN), is\r\navailable through anonymous FTP to nis.nsf.net, in the directory\r\nnsfnet.  In addition, Vint Cerf wrote on the then-proposed NREN in\r\nRFC-1167, Thoughts on the National Research and Education Network.\r\nRFCs for information on obtaining RFCs.\r\n\r\nA mailing list, nren-discuss@uu.psi.com, is available for\r\ndiscussion of the NREN; write to\r\nnren-discuss-request@uu.psi.com to be added.\r\n\r\n\"To talk in publick, to think in solitude,\r\nto read and to hear, to inquire,\r\nand to answer inquiries, is the business of a scholar.\"\r\nSamuel Johnson\r\nChapter VIII\r\nThe History of Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia\r\n\r\n-----\r\n Finding Out More\r\n\r\nInternet Resource Guide\r\n\r\nThe NSF Network Service Center (NNSC) compiles and makes available an\r\nInternet Resource Guide (IRG).  The goal of the guide is to increase the\r\nvisibility of various Internet resources that may help users do their\r\nwork better.  While not yet an exhaustive list, the guide is a useful\r\ncompendium of many resources and can be a helpful reference for a new\r\nuser.\r\n\r\nResources listed are grouped by types into sections.  Current sections\r\ninclude descriptions of online library catalogs, data archives, online\r\nwhite pages directory services, networks, network information centers,\r\nand computational resources, such as supercomputers.  Each entry\r\ndescribes the resource, identifies who can use the resource, explains\r\nhow to reach the local network via the Internet, and lists contacts\r\nfor more information.  The list is distributed electronically by the\r\nNNSC.  To receive a guide, or to get on a mailing list that alerts you\r\nto when it is updated, send a message to\r\nresource-guide-request@nnsc.nsf.net.\r\n\r\nThe current edition of the IRG is available via anonymous FTP from\r\nnnsc.nsf.net, in the directory /resource-guide.\r\n\r\nRequests for Comments\r\n\r\nThe internal workings of the Internet are defined by a set of\r\ndocuments called RFCs (Request for Comments).  The general process\r\nfor creating an RFC is for someone wanting something formalized to\r\nwrite a document describing the issue and mailing it to Jon Postel\r\n(postel@isi.edu).  He acts as a referee for the proposal.  It is then\r\ncommented upon by all those wishing to take part in the discussion\r\n(electronically, of course).  It may go through multiple revisions.\r\nShould it be generally accepted as a good idea, it will be assigned a\r\nnumber and filed with the RFCs.\r\n\r\nThe RFCs can be divided into five groups: required, suggested,\r\ndirectional, informational and obsolete.  Required RFCs (e.g.,\r\nRFC-791, The Internet Protocol) must be implemented on any host\r\nconnected to the Internet.\r\n\r\nSuggested RFCs are generally implemented by network hosts.  Lack of\r\nthem does not preclude access to the Internet, but may impact its\r\nusability.  RFC-793, Transmission Control Protocol, is a must for\r\nthose implementing TCP.\r\n\r\nDirectional RFCs were discussed and agreed to, but their application\r\nhas never come into wide use.  This may be due to the lack of wide\r\nneed for the specific application (RFC-937, The Post Office Protocol) or\r\nthat, although technically superior, ran against other pervasive\r\napproaches (RFC-891, Hello).  It is suggested that, should the facility\r\nbe required by a particular site, an implementation be done in\r\naccordance with the RFC.  This ensures that, should the idea be one\r\nwhose time has come, the implementation will be in accordance with\r\nsome standard and will be generally usable.\r\n\r\nInformational RFCs contain factual information about the Internet and\r\nits operation (RFC-990, Assigned Numbers).\r\n\r\nThere is also a subset of RFCs called FYIs (For Your Information).\r\nThey are written in a language much more informal than that used in\r\nthe other, standard RFCs.  Topics range from answers to common\r\nquestions for new and experienced users to a suggested bibliography.\r\n\r\nFinally, as the Internet has grown and technology has changed, some\r\nRFCs become unnecessary.  These obsolete RFCs cannot be ignored,\r\nhowever.  Frequently when a change is made to some RFC that causes a\r\nnew one to obsolete others, the new RFC only contains explanations and\r\nmotivations for the change.  Understanding the model on which the\r\nwhole facility is based may involve reading the original and\r\nsubsequent RFCs on the topic.\r\n\r\nRFCs and FYIs are available via FTP from many sources, including:\r\n\r\nThe nic.ddn.mil archive, as /rfc/rfc-xxxx.txt, where\r\nxxxx is the number of the RFC.\r\n\r\nfrom ftp.uu.net, in the directory /RFC.\r\n\r\nThey're also available through mail by writing to\r\nservice@nic.ddn.mil, with a Subject: line of send RFC-xxxx.TXT, again\r\nwith xxxx being the RFC number.\r\n\r\n\"Knowledge is of two kinds.

However, this booklet should provide enough\r\ninformation to make the incredible breadth and complexity of the\r\nInternet a mite less imposing.  Coupled with some exploration and\r\nexperimentation, every user has the potential to be a competent net\r\ncitizen, using the facilities that are available to their fullest.\r\n\r\nYou, the reader, are strongly encouraged to suggest improvements to\r\nany part of this booklet.  If something was unclear, left you with\r\ndoubts, or wasn't addressed, it should be fixed.

The ultimate desire is to make it so\r\none person can contact anyone else no matter where they are.  A number\r\nof \"gateways\" between networks have been set up.  They include:\r\n\r\n AppleLink\r\nQuantum Services sells access to AppleLink, which is similar to\r\nQuantumLink for Commodore computers and PCLink for IBM PCs and\r\ncompatibles.  It also provides email access through the address\r\nuser@applelink.apple.com.\r\n\r\n ATTMail\r\nAT&T sells a commercial email service called ATTMail.  Its users\r\ncan be reached by writing to user@attmail.com.\r\n\r\n BIX\r\nUsers on BIX (the Byte Information eXchange) can be reached\r\nthrough the DAS gateway at user@cibix.das.net.\r\n\r\n CompuServe (CI$)\r\nTo reach a user on the commercial service CompuServe, you must\r\naddress the mail as xxxxx.xxx@compuserve.com, with\r\nxxxxx.xxx being their CompuServe user ID.  Normally CompuServe\r\nids are represented as being separated by a comma (like\r\n71999,141); since most mailers don't react well to having\r\ncommas in addresses, it was changed to a period.  For the above\r\naddress, mail would be sent to 71999.141@compuserve.com.\r\n\r\n EasyNet\r\nDigital sells a service called EasyNet; users that subscribe to it can\r\nbe reached with the addresses user@host.enet.dec.com or\r\nuser%host.enet@decwrl.dec.com.\r\n\r\n FidoNet\r\nThe FidoNet computer network can be reached by using a special\r\naddressing method.  If John Smith is on the node 1:2/3.4 on\r\nFidoNet, his or her email address would be\r\njohn.smith@p4.f3.n2.z1.fidonet.org\r\n(notice how the numbers fall in place?).\r\n\r\n MCI Mail\r\nMCI also sells email accounts (similar to ATTMail). Users can be\r\nreached with user@mcimail.com.\r\n\r\n PeaceNet\r\nUsers on the PeaceNet network can be reached by writing to\r\nuser@igc.org.\r\n\r\n The Well\r\nUsers on the service The Well can be reached by writing to\r\nuser@well.sf.ca.us.  The Well is directly connected to the Internet.\r\n\r\nThis table is far from complete.  In addition to sites not being\r\nlisted, some services are not (nor do they plan to be) accessible\r\nfrom the \"outside\" (like Prodigy); others, like GEnie, are actively\r\ninvestigating the possibility of creating a gateway into their\r\nsystem. For the latest information, consult a list called the\r\nInter-Network Mail Guide.  It's available from a number of FTP sites,\r\nincluding UUNET; Anonymous FTP, for more information on getting a\r\ncopy of it using anonymous FTP.\r\n\r\nRetrieving Files via Email\r\n\r\nFor those who have a connection to the Internet, but cannot FTP, there\r\ndo exist a few alternatives to get those files you so desperately\r\nneed.  When requesting files, it's imperative that you keep in mind\r\nthe size of your request---odds are the other people who may be using\r\nyour link won't be too receptive to sudden bursts of really heavy\r\ntraffic on their normally sedate connection.\r\n\r\nArchive Servers\r\n\r\nAn alternative to the currently well over-used FTPmail system is\r\ntaking advantage of the many archive servers that are presently\r\nbeing maintained.  These are programs that receive email messages that\r\ncontain commands, and act on them.  For example, sending an archive\r\nserver the command help will usually yield, in the form of a\r\npiece of email, information on how to use the various commands that\r\nthe server has available.\r\n\r\nOne such archive server is service@nic.ddn.mil.  Maintained by\r\nthe Network Information Center (NIC) in Chantilly, VA, the server is\r\nset up to make all of the information at the NIC available for people\r\nwho don't have access to FTP.  This also includes the WHOIS service\r\n(Whois). Some sample Subject: lines for queries to the\r\nNIC server are:\r\n\r\nSubject: help                          Describes available commands.\r\nSubject: rfc 822                       Sends a copy of RFC-822.\r\nSubject: rfc index                     Sends an index of the available RFCs.\r\nSubject: netinfo domain-template.txt   Sends a domain application.\r\nSubject: whois widener                 Sends WHOIS information on `widener'.\r\n\r\nMore information on using their archive server can be obtained by\r\nwriting to their server address service@nic.ddn.mil with a\r\nSubject: of help.\r\n\r\nThere are different \"brands\" of archive server, each with its own\r\nset of commands and services.  Among them there often exists a common\r\nset of commands and services (e.g. index, help, etc).\r\nBe that as it may, one should always consult the individual help for a\r\nspecific server before assuming the syntax---100K surprises can be\r\nhard on a system.\r\n\r\nFTP-by-Mail Servers\r\nSome systems offer people the ability to receive files through a\r\nmock-FTP interface via email.  Anonymous FTP for a general overview of\r\nhow to FTP.  The effects of providing such a service varies, although\r\na rule of thumb is that it will probably use a substantial amount of\r\nthe available resources on a system.\r\n\r\nThe \"original\" FTP-by-Mail service, BITFTP, is available to BITNET\r\nusers from the Princeton node PUCC.  It was once accessible to\r\nanyone, but had to be closed out to non-BITNET users because of the\r\nheavy load on the system.\r\n\r\nIn response to this closure, Paul Vixie designed and installed a\r\nsystem called FTPmail on one of Digital's gateway computers,\r\ndecwrl.dec.com.  Write to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com with help in the\r\nbody of the letter for instructions on its use. The software is\r\nundergoing constant development; once it reaches a stable state,\r\nother sites will be encouraged to adopt it and provide the service\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nNewsgroup Creation\r\n\r\nEveryone has the opportunity to make a Call For Votes on the\r\nUsenet and attempt to create a newsgroup that he/she feels would be of\r\nbenefit to the general readership.  The rules governing newsgroup\r\ncreation have evolved over the years into a generally accepted method.\r\nThey only govern the \"world\" groups; they aren't applicable to\r\nregional or other alternative hierarchies.\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\n\r\nA discussion must first take place to address issues like the naming\r\nof the group, where in the group tree it should go (e.g.\r\nrec.sports.koosh vs rec.games.koosh?), and whether or not it should\r\nbe created in the first place.  The formal Request For Discussion\r\n(RFD) should be posted to news.announce.newgroups, along with any\r\nother groups or mailing lists at all related to the proposed topic.\r\nnews.announce.newgroups is moderated.  You should place it first in\r\nthe Newsgroups: header, so that it will get mailed to the moderator\r\nonly.  The article won't be immediately posted to the other\r\nnewsgroups listed; rather, it will give you the opportunity to have\r\nthe moderator correct any inconsistencies or mistakes in your RFD.\r\nHe or she will take care of posting it to the newsgroups you\r\nindicated.  Also the Followup-To: header will be set so that the\r\nactual discussion takes place only in news.groups.  If a user has\r\ndifficulty posting to a moderated group, he or she may mail\r\nsubmissions intended for news.announce.newgroups to the address\r\nannounce-newgroups@rpi.edu.\r\n\r\nThe final name and charter of the group, and whether it will be\r\nmoderated or unmoderated, will be determined during the discussion\r\nperiod.  If it's to be moderated, the discussion will also decide who\r\nthe moderator will be.  If there's no general agreement on these\r\npoints among those in favor of a new group at the end of 30 days,\r\nthe discussion will be taken into mail rather than continued posting\r\nto news.groups; that way, the proponents of the group can iron out\r\ntheir differences and come back with a proper proposal, and make\r\na new Request For Discussion.\r\n\r\nVoting\r\nAfter the discussion period (which is mandatory), if it's been\r\ndetermined that a new group really is desired, a name and charter are\r\nagreed upon, and it's been determined whether the group will be\r\nmoderated (and by whom), a Call For Votes (CFV) should be posted\r\nto news.announce.newgroups, along with any other groups that\r\nthe original Request For Discussion was posted to.  The CFV should be\r\nposted (or mailed to the news.announce.newgroups moderator) as\r\nsoon as possible after the discussion ends (to keep it fresh in\r\neveryone's mind).\r\n\r\nThe Call for Votes should include clear instructions on how to cast a\r\nvote.  It's important that it be clearly explained how to both vote\r\nfor and against a group (and be of equivalent difficulty or\r\nease).  If it's easier for you or your administrator, two separate\r\naddresses can be used to mail yes and no votes to, providing that\r\nthey're on the same machine.  Regardless of the method, everyone\r\nmust have a very specific idea of how to get his/her vote counted.\r\n\r\nThe voting period can last between 21 and 31 days, no matter what the\r\npreliminary results of the vote are.  A vote can't be called off\r\nsimply because 400 \"no\" votes have come in and only two \"yes\"\r\nvotes.  The Call for Votes should include the exact date that the\r\nvoting period will end---only those votes arriving on the vote-taker's\r\nmachine before this date can be counted.\r\n\r\nTo keep awareness high, the CFV can be repeated during the vote,\r\nprovided that it gives the same clear, unbiased instructions for\r\ncasting a vote as the original; it also has to be the same proposal as\r\nwas first posted.  The charter can't change in mid-vote. Also, votes\r\nthat're posted don't count---only those that were mailed to the\r\nvote-taker can be tallied.\r\n\r\nPartial results should never be included; only a statement of\r\nthe specific proposal, that a vote is in progress on it, and how to\r\ncast a vote.  A mass acknowledgement (\"Mass ACK\" or \"Vote ACK\") is\r\npermitted; however, it must be presented in a way that gives no\r\nindication of which way a person voted.  One way to avoid this is to\r\ncreate one large list of everyone who's voted, and sort it in\r\nalphabetical order.  It should not be two sorted lists (of the yes and\r\nno votes, respectively).\r\n\r\nEvery vote is autonomous.  The votes for or against one group can't be\r\ntransferred to another, similar proposal.  A vote can only count for\r\nthe exact proposal that it was a response to.  In particular, a vote\r\nfor or against a newsgroup under one name can't be counted as a vote\r\nfor or against another group with a different name or charter, a\r\ndifferent moderated/unmoderated status, or, if it's moderated, a\r\ndifferent moderator or set of moderators.  Whew!\r\n\r\nFinally, the vote has to be explicit; they should be of the form I\r\nvote for the group foo.bar as proposed or I vote against the group\r\nfoo.bar as proposed.  The wording doesn't have to be exact, your\r\nintention just has to be clear.\r\n\r\nThe Result of a Vote\r\n\r\nAt the end of the voting period, the vote-taker has to post (to\r\nnews.announce.newgroups) the tally and email addresses of the votes\r\nreceived.  Again, it can also be posted to any of the groups listed in\r\nthe original CFV.  The tally should make clear which way a person\r\nvoted, so the results can be verified if it proves necessary to do so.\r\n\r\nAfter the vote result is posted to news.announce.newgroups,\r\nthere is a mandatory five-day waiting period.  This affords everyone\r\nthe opportunity to correct any errors or inconsistencies in the voter\r\nlist or the voting procedure.\r\n\r\nCreation of the Group\r\n\r\nIf, after the waiting period, there are no serious objections that\r\nmight invalidate the vote, the vote is put to the \"water test.\"  If\r\nthere were 100 more valid YES/create votes than NO/don't create\r\nvotes, and at least two-thirds of the total number of votes are in\r\nfavor of creation, then a newgroup control message can be sent out\r\n(often by the moderator of news.announce.newgroups).  If the 100-vote\r\nmargin or the two-thirds percentage isn't met, the group has failed\r\nand can't be created.\r\n\r\nIf the proposal failed, all is not lost---after a six-month waiting\r\nperiod (a \"cooling down\"), a new Request For Discussion can be posted\r\nto news.groups, and the whole process can start over again.  If after\r\na couple of tries it becomes obvious that the group is not\r\nwanted or needed, the vote-taker should humbly step back and accept\r\nthe opinion of the majority.  (As life goes, so goes Usenet.)\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nGlossary\r\n\r\nThis glossary is only a tiny subset of all of the various terms and\r\nother things that people regularly use on The Net.  For a more\r\ncomplete (and very entertaining) reference, it's suggested you get a\r\ncopy of The New Hacker's Dictionary, which is based on a VERY large\r\ntext file called the Jargon File.  Edited by Eric Raymond\r\n(eric@snark.thyrsus.com), it is available from the MIT Press,\r\nCambridge, Massachusetts, 02142; its ISBN number is 0-262-68069-6.\r\nAlso see RFC-1208, A Glossary of Networking Terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n :-)\r\nThis odd symbol is one of the ways a person can portray \"mood\" in\r\nthe very flat medium of computers---by using \"smilies.\"  This is\r\n`metacommunication', and there are literally hundreds of them, from\r\nthe obvious to the obscure.  This particular example expresses\r\n\"happiness.\"  Don't see it?  Tilt your head to the left 90 degrees.\r\nSmilies are also used to denote sarcasm.\r\n\r\nNetwork addresses are usually of two types:\r\n\r\nthe physical or hardware address of a network interface card; for\r\nethernet this 48-bit address might be 0260.8C00.7666.  The hardware\r\naddress is used to forward packets within a physical network.\r\nFortunately, network users do not have to be concerned about hardware\r\naddresses since they are automatically handled by the networking\r\nsoftware.\r\n\r\nThe logical or Internet address is used to facilitate moving data\r\nbetween physical networks.  The 32-bit Internet address is made up of a\r\nnetwork number, a subnetwork number, and a host number.  Each host\r\ncomputer on the Internet, has a unique address.  For example, all\r\nInternet addresses at Colorado State have a network number of 129.82, a\r\nsubnet number in the range of 1-254, and a host number in the range of\r\n1-254.  All Internet hosts have a numeric address and an English-style\r\nname.  For example, the Internet address for UCC's CYBER 840 is\r\n129.82.103.96; its Internet name is csugreen.UCC.ColoState.EDU.\r\n\r\n address resolution\r\nConversion of an Internet address to the corresponding physical address.\r\nOn an ethernet, resolution requires broadcasting on the local area network.\r\n\r\n administrivia\r\nAdministrative tasks, most often related to the maintenance of mailing\r\nlists, digests, news gateways, etc.\r\n\r\n anonymous FTP\r\nAlso known as \"anon FTP\"; a service provided to make files available\r\nto the general Internet community---Anonymous FTP.\r\n\r\n ANSI\r\nThe American National Standards Institute disseminates basic standards\r\nlike ASCII, and acts as the United States' delegate to the ISO.\r\nStandards can be ordered from ANSI by writing to the ANSI Sales Department,\r\n1430 Broadway, New York, NY 10018, or by telephoning (212) 354-3300.\r\n\r\n archie\r\nA service which provides lookups for packages in a database of the\r\nofferings of countless of anonymous FTP sites.  archie for a\r\nfull description.\r\n\r\n archive server\r\nAn email-based file transfer facility offered by some systems.\r\n\r\n ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency)\r\nFormer name of DARPA, the government agency that funded ARPAnet and\r\nlater the DARPA Internet.\r\n\r\n ARPAnet\r\nA pioneering long haul network funded by ARPA.  It\r\nserved as the basis for early networking research as well as a\r\ncentral backbone during the development of the Internet.
