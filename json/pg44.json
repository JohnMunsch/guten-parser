FRIENDS OF CHILDHOOD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nDr. Howard Archie had just come up from a game of pool with the Jewish\r\nclothier and two traveling men who happened to be staying overnight in\r\nMoonstone. His offices were in the Duke Block, over the drug store.\r\nLarry, the doctor's man, had lit the overhead light in the waiting-room\r\nand the double student's lamp on the desk in the study. The isinglass\r\nsides of the hard-coal burner were aglow, and the air in the study was\r\nso hot that as he came in the doctor opened the door into his little\r\noperating-room, where there was no stove. The waiting room was carpeted\r\nand stiffly furnished, something like a country parlor. The study had\r\nworn, unpainted floors, but there was a look of winter comfort about it.\r\nThe doctor's flat-top desk was large and well made; the papers were in\r\norderly piles, under glass weights. Behind the stove a wide bookcase,\r\nwith double glass doors, reached from the floor to the ceiling. It was\r\nfilled with medical books of every thickness and color. On the top shelf\r\nstood a long row of thirty or forty volumes, bound all alike in dark\r\nmottled board covers, with imitation leather backs.\r\n\r\nAs the doctor in New England villages is proverbially old, so the doctor\r\nin small Colorado towns twenty-five years ago was generally young.\r\nDr. Archie was barely thirty. He was tall, with massive shoulders\r\nwhich he held stiffly, and a large, well-shaped head. He was a\r\ndistinguished-looking man, for that part of the world, at least.\r\n\r\nThere was something individual in the way in which his reddish-brown\r\nhair, parted cleanly at the side, bushed over his high forehead. His\r\nnose was straight and thick, and his eyes were intelligent. He wore a\r\ncurly, reddish mustache and an imperial, cut trimly, which made him look\r\na little like the pictures of Napoleon III. His hands were large and\r\nwell kept, but ruggedly formed, and the backs were shaded with crinkly\r\nreddish hair. He wore a blue suit of woolly, wide-waled serge; the\r\ntraveling men had known at a glance that it was made by a Denver tailor.\r\nThe doctor was always well dressed.\r\n\r\nDr. Archie turned up the student's lamp and sat down in the swivel chair\r\nbefore his desk. He sat uneasily, beating a tattoo on his knees with his\r\nfingers, and looked about him as if he were bored. He glanced at his\r\nwatch, then absently took from his pocket a bunch of small keys,\r\nselected one and looked at it. A contemptuous smile, barely perceptible,\r\nplayed on his lips, but his eyes remained meditative. Behind the door\r\nthat led into the hall, under his buffalo-skin driving-coat, was a locked\r\ncupboard. This the doctor opened mechanically, kicking aside a pile of\r\nmuddy overshoes. Inside, on the shelves, were whiskey glasses and\r\ndecanters, lemons, sugar, and bitters. Hearing a step in the empty,\r\nechoing hall without, the doctor closed the cupboard again, snapping the\r\nYale lock. The door of the waiting-room opened, a man entered and came\r\non into the consulting-room.\r\n\r\n\"Good-evening, Mr. Kronborg,\" said the doctor carelessly. \"Sit down.\"\r\n\r\nHis visitor was a tall, loosely built man, with a thin brown beard,\r\nstreaked with gray. He wore a frock coat, a broad-brimmed black hat, a\r\nwhite lawn necktie, and steel rimmed spectacles. Altogether there was a\r\npretentious and important air about him, as he lifted the skirts of his\r\ncoat and sat down.\r\n\r\n\"Good-evening, doctor. Can you step around to the house with me? I think\r\nMrs. Kronborg will need you this evening.\" This was said with profound\r\ngravity and, curiously enough, with a slight embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\"Any hurry?\" the doctor asked over his shoulder as he went into his\r\noperating-room.\r\n\r\nMr. Kronborg coughed behind his hand, and contracted his brows. His face\r\nthreatened at every moment to break into a smile of foolish excitement.\r\nHe controlled it only by calling upon his habitual pulpit manner. \"Well,\r\nI think it would be as well to go immediately. Mrs. Kronborg will be\r\nmore comfortable if you are there. She has been suffering for some\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor came back and threw a black bag upon his desk. He wrote some\r\ninstructions for his man on a prescription pad and then drew on his\r\novercoat. \"All ready,\" he announced, putting out his lamp. Mr. Kronborg\r\nrose and they tramped through the empty hall and down the stairway to\r\nthe street. The drug store below was dark, and the saloon next door was\r\njust closing. Every other light on Main Street was out.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the road and at the outer edge of the board sidewalk,\r\nthe snow had been shoveled into breastworks. The town looked small and\r\nblack, flattened down in the snow, muffled and all but extinguished.\r\nOverhead the stars shone gloriously. It was impossible not to notice\r\nthem. The air was so clear that the white sand hills to the east of\r\nMoonstone gleamed softly. Following the Reverend Mr. Kronborg along the\r\nnarrow walk, past the little dark, sleeping houses, the doctor looked up\r\nat the flashing night and whistled softly. It did seem that people were\r\nstupider than they need be; as if on a night like this there ought to be\r\nsomething better to do than to sleep nine hours, or to assist Mrs.\r\nKronborg in functions which she could have performed so admirably\r\nunaided. He wished he had gone down to Denver to hear Fay Templeton sing\r\n\"See-Saw.\" Then he remembered that he had a personal interest in this\r\nfamily, after all. They turned into another street and saw before them\r\nlighted windows; a low story-and-a-half house, with a wing built on at\r\nthe right and a kitchen addition at the back, everything a little on the\r\nslant--roofs, windows, and doors. As they approached the gate, Peter\r\nKronborg's pace grew brisker. His nervous, ministerial cough annoyed the\r\ndoctor. \"Exactly as if he were going to give out a text,\" he thought. He\r\ndrew off his glove and felt in his vest pocket. \"Have a troche,\r\nKronborg,\" he said, producing some. \"Sent me for samples. Very good for\r\na rough throat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, thank you, thank you. I was in something of a hurry. I neglected to\r\nput on my overshoes. Here we are, doctor.\" Kronborg opened his front\r\ndoor--seemed delighted to be at home again.\r\n\r\nThe front hall was dark and cold; the hatrack was hung with an\r\nastonishing number of children's hats and caps and cloaks. They were\r\neven piled on the table beneath the hatrack. Under the table was a heap\r\nof rubbers and overshoes. While the doctor hung up his coat and hat,\r\nPeter Kronborg opened the door into the living-room. A glare of light\r\ngreeted them, and a rush of hot, stale air, smelling of warming\r\nflannels.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock in the morning Dr. Archie was in the parlor putting on\r\nhis cuffs and coat--there was no spare bedroom in that house. Peter\r\nKronborg's seventh child, a boy, was being soothed and cosseted by his\r\naunt, Mrs. Kronborg was asleep, and the doctor was going home. But he\r\nwanted first to speak to Kronborg, who, coatless and fluttery, was\r\npouring coal into the kitchen stove. As the doctor crossed the\r\ndining-room he paused and listened. From one of the wing rooms, off to\r\nthe left, he heard rapid, distressed breathing. He went to the kitchen\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\"One of the children sick in there?\" he asked, nodding toward the\r\npartition.\r\n\r\nKronborg hung up the stove-lifter and dusted his fingers. \"It must be\r\nThea. I meant to ask you to look at her. She has a croupy cold. But in\r\nmy excitement--Mrs. Kronborg is doing finely, eh, doctor? Not many of\r\nyour patients with such a constitution, I expect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. She's a fine mother.\" The doctor took up the lamp from the\r\nkitchen table and unceremoniously went into the wing room. Two chubby\r\nlittle boys were asleep in a double bed, with the coverlids over their\r\nnoses and their feet drawn up. In a single bed, next to theirs, lay a\r\nlittle girl of eleven, wide awake, two yellow braids sticking up on the\r\npillow behind her. Her face was scarlet and her eyes were blazing.\r\n\r\nThe doctor shut the door behind him. \"Feel pretty sick, Thea?\" he asked\r\nas he took out his thermometer. \"Why didn't you call somebody?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with greedy affection. \"I thought you were here,\" she\r\nspoke between quick breaths. \"There is a new baby, isn't there? Which?\"\r\n\r\n\"Which?\" repeated the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Brother or sister?\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled and sat down on the edge of the bed. \"Brother,\" he said,\r\ntaking her hand. \"Open.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. Brothers are better,\" she murmured as he put the glass tube under\r\nher tongue.\r\n\r\n\"Now, be still, I want to count.\" Dr. Archie reached for her hand and\r\ntook out his watch. When he put her hand back under the quilt he went\r\nover to one of the windows--they were both tight shut--and lifted it a\r\nlittle way. He reached up and ran his hand along the cold, unpapered\r\nwall. \"Keep under the covers; I'll come back to you in a moment,\" he\r\nsaid, bending over the glass lamp with his thermometer. He winked at her\r\nfrom the door before he shut it.\r\n\r\nPeter Kronborg was sitting in his wife's room, holding the bundle which\r\ncontained his son. His air of cheerful importance, his beard and\r\nglasses, even his shirt-sleeves, annoyed the doctor. He beckoned\r\nKronborg into the living-room and said sternly:--\r\n\r\n\"You've got a very sick child in there. Why didn't you call me before?\r\nIt's pneumonia, and she must have been sick for several days. Put the\r\nbaby down somewhere, please, and help me make up the bed-lounge here in\r\nthe parlor. She's got to be in a warm room, and she's got to be quiet.\r\nYou must keep the other children out. Here, this thing opens up, I see,\"\r\nswinging back the top of the carpet lounge. \"We can lift her mattress\r\nand carry her in just as she is. I don't want to disturb her more than\r\nis necessary.\"\r\n\r\nKronborg was all concern immediately. The two men took up the mattress\r\nand carried the sick child into the parlor. \"I'll have to go down to my\r\noffice to get some medicine, Kronborg. The drug store won't be open.\r\nKeep the covers on her. I won't be gone long. Shake down the stove and\r\nput on a little coal, but not too much; so it'll catch quickly, I mean.\r\nFind an old sheet for me, and put it there to warm.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor caught his coat and hurried out into the dark street. Nobody\r\nwas stirring yet, and the cold was bitter. He was tired and hungry and\r\nin no mild humor. \"The idea!\" he muttered; \"to be such an ass at his\r\nage, about the seventh! And to feel no responsibility about the little\r\ngirl. Silly old goat! The baby would have got into the world somehow;\r\nthey always do. But a nice little girl like that--she's worth the whole\r\nlitter. Where she ever got it from--\" He turned into the Duke Block and\r\nran up the stairs to his office.\r\n\r\nThea Kronborg, meanwhile, was wondering why she happened to be in the\r\nparlor, where nobody but company--usually visiting preachers--ever\r\nslept. She had moments of stupor when she did not see anything, and\r\nmoments of excitement when she felt that something unusual and pleasant\r\nwas about to happen, when she saw everything clearly in the red light\r\nfrom the isinglass sides of the hard-coal burner--the nickel trimmings\r\non the stove itself, the pictures on the wall, which she thought very\r\nbeautiful, the flowers on the Brussels carpet, Czerny's \"Daily Studies\"\r\nwhich stood open on the upright piano. She forgot, for the time being,\r\nall about the new baby.\r\n\r\nWhen she heard the front door open, it occurred to her that the pleasant\r\nthing which was going to happen was Dr. Archie himself. He came in and\r\nwarmed his hands at the stove. As he turned to her, she threw herself\r\nwearily toward him, half out of her bed. She would have tumbled to the\r\nfloor had he not caught her. He gave her some medicine and went to the\r\nkitchen for something he needed. She drowsed and lost the sense of his\r\nbeing there. When she opened her eyes again, he was kneeling before the\r\nstove, spreading something dark and sticky on a white cloth, with a big\r\nspoon; batter, perhaps. Presently she felt him taking off her nightgown.\r\nHe wrapped the hot plaster about her chest. There seemed to be straps\r\nwhich he pinned over her shoulders. Then he took out a thread and needle\r\nand began to sew her up in it. That, she felt, was too strange; she must\r\nbe dreaming anyhow, so she succumbed to her drowsiness.\r\n\r\nThea had been moaning with every breath since the doctor came back, but\r\nshe did not know it. She did not realize that she was suffering pain.\r\nWhen she was conscious at all, she seemed to be separated from her body;\r\nto be perched on top of the piano, or on the hanging lamp, watching the\r\ndoctor sew her up. It was perplexing and unsatisfactory, like dreaming.\r\nShe wished she could waken up and see what was going on.\r\n\r\nThe doctor thanked God that he had persuaded Peter Kronborg to keep out\r\nof the way. He could do better by the child if he had her to himself. He\r\nhad no children of his own. His marriage was a very unhappy one. As he\r\nlifted and undressed Thea, he thought to himself what a beautiful thing\r\na little girl's body was,--like a flower. It was so neatly and\r\ndelicately fashioned, so soft, and so milky white. Thea must have got\r\nher hair and her silky skin from her mother. She was a little Swede,\r\nthrough and through. Dr. Archie could not help thinking how he would\r\ncherish a little creature like this if she were his. Her hands, so\r\nlittle and hot, so clever, too,--he glanced at the open exercise book on\r\nthe piano. When he had stitched up the flaxseed jacket, he wiped it\r\nneatly about the edges, where the paste had worked out on the skin. He\r\nput on her the clean nightgown he had warmed before the fire, and tucked\r\nthe blankets about her. As he pushed back the hair that had fuzzed down\r\nover her eyebrows, he felt her head thoughtfully with the tips of his\r\nfingers. No, he couldn't say that it was different from any other\r\nchild's head, though he believed that there was something very different\r\nabout her. He looked intently at her wide, flushed face, freckled nose,\r\nfierce little mouth, and her delicate, tender chin--the one soft touch\r\nin her hard little Scandinavian face, as if some fairy godmother had\r\ncaressed her there and left a cryptic promise. Her brows were usually\r\ndrawn together defiantly, but never when she was with Dr. Archie. Her\r\naffection for him was prettier than most of the things that went to make\r\nup the doctor's life in Moonstone.\r\n\r\nThe windows grew gray. He heard a tramping on the attic floor, on the\r\nback stairs, then cries: \"Give me my shirt!\" \"Where's my other\r\nstocking?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll have to stay till they get off to school,\" he reflected, \"or\r\nthey'll be in here tormenting her, the whole lot of them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nFor the next four days it seemed to Dr. Archie that his patient might\r\nslip through his hands, do what he might. But she did not. On the\r\ncontrary, after that she recovered very rapidly. As her father remarked,\r\nshe must have inherited the \"constitution\" which he was never tired of\r\nadmiring in her mother.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, when her new brother was a week old, the doctor found\r\nThea very comfortable and happy in her bed in the parlor. The sunlight\r\nwas pouring in over her shoulders, the baby was asleep on a pillow in a\r\nbig rocking-chair beside her. Whenever he stirred, she put out her hand\r\nand rocked him. Nothing of him was visible but a flushed, puffy forehead\r\nand an uncompromisingly big, bald cranium. The door into her mother's\r\nroom stood open, and Mrs. Kronborg was sitting up in bed darning\r\nstockings. She was a short, stalwart woman, with a short neck and a\r\ndetermined-looking head. Her skin was very fair, her face calm and\r\nunwrinkled, and her yellow hair, braided down her back as she lay in\r\nbed, still looked like a girl's. She was a woman whom Dr. Archie\r\nrespected; active, practical, unruffled; goodhumored, but determined.\r\nExactly the sort of woman to take care of a flighty preacher. She had\r\nbrought her husband some property, too,--one fourth of her father's\r\nbroad acres in Nebraska,--but this she kept in her own name. She had\r\nprofound respect for her husband's erudition and eloquence. She sat\r\nunder his preaching with deep humility, and was as much taken in by his\r\nstiff shirt and white neckties as if she had not ironed them herself by\r\nlamplight the night before they appeared correct and spotless in the\r\npulpit. But for all this, she had no confidence in his administration of\r\nworldly affairs. She looked to him for morning prayers and grace at\r\ntable; she expected him to name the babies and to supply whatever\r\nparental sentiment there was in the house, to remember birthdays and\r\nanniversaries, to point the children to moral and patriotic ideals. It\r\nwas her work to keep their bodies, their clothes, and their conduct in\r\nsome sort of order, and this she accomplished with a success that was a\r\nsource of wonder to her neighbors. As she used to remark, and her\r\nhusband admiringly to echo, she \"had never lost one.\" With all his\r\nflightiness, Peter Kronborg appreciated the matter-of-fact, punctual way\r\nin which his wife got her children into the world and along in it. He\r\nbelieved, and he was right in believing, that the sovereign State of\r\nColorado was much indebted to Mrs. Kronborg and women like her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kronborg believed that the size of every family was decided in\r\nheaven. More modern views would not have startled her; they would simply\r\nhave seemed foolish--thin chatter, like the boasts of the men who built\r\nthe tower of Babel, or like Axel's plan to breed ostriches in the\r\nchicken yard. From what evidence Mrs. Kronborg formed her opinions on\r\nthis and other matters, it would have been difficult to say, but once\r\nformed, they were unchangeable. She would no more have questioned her\r\nconvictions than she would have questioned revelation. Calm and even\r\ntempered, naturally kind, she was capable of strong prejudices, and she\r\nnever forgave.\r\n\r\nWhen the doctor came in to see Thea, Mrs. Kronborg was reflecting that\r\nthe washing was a week behind, and deciding what she had better do about\r\nit. The arrival of a new baby meant a revision of her entire domestic\r\nschedule, and as she drove her needle along she had been working out new\r\nsleeping arrangements and cleaning days. The doctor had entered the\r\nhouse without knocking, after making noise enough in the hall to prepare\r\nhis patients. Thea was reading, her book propped up before her in the\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\n\"Mustn't do that; bad for your eyes,\" he said, as Thea shut the book\r\nquickly and slipped it under the covers.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kronborg called from her bed: \"Bring the baby here, doctor, and\r\nhave that chair. She wanted him in there for company.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the doctor picked up the baby, he put a yellow paper bag down on\r\nThea's coverlid and winked at her. They had a code of winks and\r\ngrimaces. When he went in to chat with her mother, Thea opened the bag\r\ncautiously, trying to keep it from crackling. She drew out a long bunch\r\nof white grapes, with a little of the sawdust in which they had been\r\npacked still clinging to them. They were called Malaga grapes in\r\nMoonstone, and once or twice during the winter the leading grocer got a\r\nkeg of them. They were used mainly for table decoration, about\r\nChristmas-time. Thea had never had more than one grape at a time before.\r\nWhen the doctor came back she was holding the almost transparent fruit\r\nup in the sunlight, feeling the pale-green skins softly with the tips of\r\nher fingers. She did not thank him; she only snapped her eyes at him in\r\na special way which he understood, and, when he gave her his hand, put\r\nit quickly and shyly under her cheek, as if she were trying to do so\r\nwithout knowing it--and without his knowing it.\r\n\r\nDr. Archie sat down in the rocking-chair. \"And how's Thea feeling\r\nto-day?\"\r\n\r\nHe was quite as shy as his patient, especially when a third person\r\noverheard his conversation. Big and handsome and superior to his fellow\r\ntownsmen as Dr. Archie was, he was seldom at his ease, and like Peter\r\nKronborg he often dodged behind a professional manner. There was\r\nsometimes a contraction of embarrassment and self consciousness all over\r\nhis big body, which made him awkward--likely to stumble, to kick up\r\nrugs, or to knock over chairs. If any one was very sick, he forgot\r\nhimself, but he had a clumsy touch in convalescent gossip.\r\n\r\nThea curled up on her side and looked at him with pleasure. \"All right.\r\nI like to be sick. I have more fun then than other times.\"\r\n\r\n\"How's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't have to go to school, and I don't have to practice. I can read\r\nall I want to, and have good things,\"--she patted the grapes. \"I had\r\nlots of fun that time I mashed my finger and you wouldn't let Professor\r\nWunsch make me practice. Only I had to do left hand, even then. I think\r\nthat was mean.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor took her hand and examined the forefinger, where the nail had\r\ngrown back a little crooked. \"You mustn't trim it down close at the\r\ncorner there, and then it will grow straight. You won't want it crooked\r\nwhen you're a big girl and wear rings and have sweethearts.\"\r\n\r\nShe made a mocking little face at him and looked at his new scarf-pin.\r\n\"That's the prettiest one you ev-ER had. I wish you'd stay a long while\r\nand let me look at it. What is it?\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie laughed. \"It's an opal. Spanish Johnny brought it up for me\r\nfrom Chihuahua in his shoe. I had it set in Denver, and I wore it to-day\r\nfor your benefit.\"\r\n\r\nThea had a curious passion for jewelry. She wanted every shining stone\r\nshe saw, and in summer she was always going off into the sand hills to\r\nhunt for crystals and agates and bits of pink chalcedony. She had two\r\ncigar boxes full of stones that she had found or traded for, and she\r\nimagined that they were of enormous value. She was always planning how\r\nshe would have them set.\r\n\r\n\"What are you reading?\" The doctor reached under the covers and pulled\r\nout a book of Byron's poems. \"Do you like this?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked confused, turned over a few pages rapidly, and pointed to \"My\r\nnative land, good-night.\" \"That,\" she said sheepishly.\r\n\r\n\"How about 'Maid of Athens'?\"\r\n\r\nShe blushed and looked at him suspiciously. \"I like 'There was a sound\r\nof revelry,'\" she muttered.\r\n\r\nThe doctor laughed and closed the book. It was clumsily bound in padded\r\nleather and had been presented to the Reverend Peter Kronborg by his\r\nSunday-School class as an ornament for his parlor table.\r\n\r\n\"Come into the office some day, and I'll lend you a nice book. You can\r\nskip the parts you don't understand. You can read it in vacation.\r\nPerhaps you'll be able to understand all of it by then.\"\r\n\r\nThea frowned and looked fretfully toward the piano. \"In vacation I have\r\nto practice four hours every day, and then there'll be Thor to take care\r\nof.\" She pronounced it \"Tor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thor? Oh, you've named the baby Thor?\" exclaimed the doctor.\r\n\r\nThea frowned again, still more fiercely, and said quickly, \"That's a\r\nnice name, only maybe it's a little--old fashioned.\" She was very\r\nsensitive about being thought a foreigner, and was proud of the fact\r\nthat, in town, her father always preached in English; very bookish\r\nEnglish, at that, one might add.\r\n\r\nBorn in an old Scandinavian colony in Minnesota, Peter Kronborg had been\r\nsent to a small divinity school in Indiana by the women of a Swedish\r\nevangelical mission, who were convinced of his gifts and who skimped and\r\nbegged and gave church suppers to get the long, lazy youth through the\r\nseminary. He could still speak enough Swedish to exhort and to bury the\r\nmembers of his country church out at Copper Hole, and he wielded in his\r\nMoonstone pulpit a somewhat pompous English vocabulary he had learned\r\nout of books at college. He always spoke of \"the infant Saviour,\" \"our\r\nHeavenly Father,\" etc. The poor man had no natural, spontaneous human\r\nspeech. If he had his sincere moments, they were perforce inarticulate.\r\nProbably a good deal of his pretentiousness was due to the fact that he\r\nhabitually expressed himself in a book learned language, wholly remote\r\nfrom anything personal, native, or homely. Mrs. Kronborg spoke Swedish\r\nto her own sisters and to her sister-in-law Tillie, and colloquial\r\nEnglish to her neighbors. Thea, who had a rather sensitive ear, until\r\nshe went to school never spoke at all, except in monosyllables, and her\r\nmother was convinced that she was tongue-tied. She was still inept in\r\nspeech for a child so intelligent. Her ideas were usually clear, but she\r\nseldom attempted to explain them, even at school, where she excelled in\r\n\"written work\" and never did more than mutter a reply.\r\n\r\n\"Your music professor stopped me on the street to-day and asked me how\r\nyou were,\" said the doctor, rising. \"He'll be sick himself, trotting\r\naround in this slush with no overcoat or overshoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's poor,\" said Thea simply.\r\n\r\nThe doctor sighed. \"I'm afraid he's worse than that. Is he always all\r\nright when you take your lessons? Never acts as if he'd been drinking?\"\r\n\r\nThea looked angry and spoke excitedly. \"He knows a lot. More than\r\nanybody. I don't care if he does drink; he's old and poor.\" Her voice\r\nshook a little.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kronborg spoke up from the next room. \"He's a good teacher, doctor.\r\nIt's good for us he does drink. He'd never be in a little place like\r\nthis if he didn't have some weakness. These women that teach music\r\naround here don't know nothing. I wouldn't have my child wasting time\r\nwith them. If Professor Wunsch goes away, Thea'll have nobody to take\r\nfrom. He's careful with his scholars; he don't use bad language. Mrs.\r\nKohler is always present when Thea takes her lesson. It's all right.\"\r\nMrs. Kronborg spoke calmly and judicially. One could see that she had\r\nthought the matter out before.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad to hear that, Mrs. Kronborg. I wish we could get the old man\r\noff his bottle and keep him tidy. Do you suppose if I gave you an old\r\novercoat you could get him to wear it?\" The doctor went to the bedroom\r\ndoor and Mrs. Kronborg looked up from her darning.\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes, I guess he'd be glad of it. He'll take most anything from me.\r\nHe won't buy clothes, but I guess he'd wear 'em if he had 'em. I've\r\nnever had any clothes to give him, having so many to make over for.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll have Larry bring the coat around to-night. You aren't cross with\r\nme, Thea?\" taking her hand.\r\n\r\nThea grinned warmly. \"Not if you give Professor Wunsch a coat--and\r\nthings,\" she tapped the grapes significantly. The doctor bent over and\r\nkissed her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nBeing sick was all very well, but Thea knew from experience that\r\nstarting back to school again was attended by depressing difficulties.\r\nOne Monday morning she got up early with Axel and Gunner, who shared her\r\nwing room, and hurried into the back living-room, between the\r\ndining-room and the kitchen. There, beside a soft-coal stove, the\r\nyounger children of the family undressed at night and dressed in the\r\nmorning. The older daughter, Anna, and the two big boys slept upstairs,\r\nwhere the rooms were theoretically warmed by stovepipes from below. The\r\nfirst (and the worst!) thing that confronted Thea was a suit of clean,\r\nprickly red flannel, fresh from the wash. Usually the torment of\r\nbreaking in a clean suit of flannel came on Sunday, but yesterday, as\r\nshe was staying in the house, she had begged off. Their winter underwear\r\nwas a trial to all the children, but it was bitterest to Thea because\r\nshe happened to have the most sensitive skin. While she was tugging it\r\non, her Aunt Tillie brought in warm water from the boiler and filled the\r\ntin pitcher. Thea washed her face, brushed and braided her hair, and got\r\ninto her blue cashmere dress. Over this she buttoned a long apron, with\r\nsleeves, which would not be removed until she put on her cloak to go to\r\nschool. Gunner and Axel, on the soap box behind the stove, had their\r\nusual quarrel about which should wear the tightest stockings, but they\r\nexchanged reproaches in low tones, for they were wholesomely afraid of\r\nMrs. Kronborg's rawhide whip. She did not chastise her children often,\r\nbut she did it thoroughly. Only a somewhat stern system of discipline\r\ncould have kept any degree of order and quiet in that overcrowded house.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kronborg's children were all trained to dress themselves at the\r\nearliest possible age, to make their own beds,--the boys as well as the\r\ngirls,--to take care of their clothes, to eat what was given them, and\r\nto keep out of the way. Mrs. Kronborg would have made a good chess\r\nplayer; she had a head for moves and positions.\r\n\r\nAnna, the elder daughter, was her mother's lieutenant. All the children\r\nknew that they must obey Anna, who was an obstinate contender for\r\nproprieties and not always fair minded. To see the young Kronborgs\r\nheaded for Sunday School was like watching a military drill. Mrs.\r\nKronborg let her children's minds alone. She did not pry into their\r\nthoughts or nag them. She respected them as individuals, and outside of\r\nthe house they had a great deal of liberty. But their communal life was\r\ndefinitely ordered.\r\n\r\nIn the winter the children breakfasted in the kitchen; Gus and Charley\r\nand Anna first, while the younger children were dressing. Gus was\r\nnineteen and was a clerk in a dry-goods store. Charley, eighteen months\r\nyounger, worked in a feed store. They left the house by the kitchen door\r\nat seven o'clock, and then Anna helped her Aunt Tillie get the breakfast\r\nfor the younger ones. Without the help of this sister-in-law, Tillie\r\nKronborg, Mrs. Kronborg's life would have been a hard one. Mrs. Kronborg\r\noften reminded Anna that \"no hired help would ever have taken the same\r\ninterest.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kronborg came of a poorer stock than his wife; from a lowly,\r\nignorant family that had lived in a poor part of Sweden. His\r\ngreat-grandfather had gone to Norway to work as a farm laborer and had\r\nmarried a Norwegian girl. This strain of Norwegian blood came out\r\nsomewhere in each generation of the Kronborgs. The intemperance of one\r\nof Peter Kronborg's uncles, and the religious mania of another, had been\r\nalike charged to the Norwegian grandmother. Both Peter Kronborg and his\r\nsister Tillie were more like the Norwegian root of the family than like\r\nthe Swedish, and this same Norwegian strain was strong in Thea, though\r\nin her it took a very different character.\r\n\r\nTillie was a queer, addle-pated thing, as flighty as a girl at\r\nthirty-five, and overweeningly fond of gay clothes--which taste, as Mrs.\r\nKronborg philosophically said, did nobody any harm. Tillie was always\r\ncheerful, and her tongue was still for scarcely a minute during the day.\r\nShe had been cruelly overworked on her father's Minnesota farm when she\r\nwas a young girl, and she had never been so happy as she was now; had\r\nnever before, as she said, had such social advantages. She thought her\r\nbrother the most important man in Moonstone. She never missed a church\r\nservice, and, much to the embarrassment of the children, she always\r\n\"spoke a piece\" at the Sunday-School concerts. She had a complete set of\r\n\"Standard Recitations,\" which she conned on Sundays. This morning, when\r\nThea and her two younger brothers sat down to breakfast, Tillie was\r\nremonstrating with Gunner because he had not learned a recitation\r\nassigned to him for George Washington Day at school. The unmemorized\r\ntext lay heavily on Gunner's conscience as he attacked his buckwheat\r\ncakes and sausage. He knew that Tillie was in the right, and that \"when\r\nthe day came he would be ashamed of himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care,\" he muttered, stirring his coffee; \"they oughtn't to make\r\nboys speak. It's all right for girls. They like to show off.\"\r\n\r\n\"No showing off about it. Boys ought to like to speak up for their\r\ncountry. And what was the use of your father buying you a new suit, if\r\nyou're not going to take part in anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was for Sunday-School. I'd rather wear my old one, anyhow. Why\r\ndidn't they give the piece to Thea?\" Gunner grumbled.\r\n\r\nTillie was turning buckwheat cakes at the griddle. \"Thea can play and\r\nsing, she don't need to speak. But you've got to know how to do\r\nsomething, Gunner, that you have. What are you going to do when you git\r\nbig and want to git into society, if you can't do nothing? Everybody'll\r\nsay, 'Can you sing? Can you play? Can you speak? Then git right out of\r\nsociety.' An' that's what they'll say to you, Mr. Gunner.\"\r\n\r\nGunner and Alex grinned at Anna, who was preparing her mother's\r\nbreakfast. They never made fun of Tillie, but they understood well\r\nenough that there were subjects upon which her ideas were rather\r\nfoolish. When Tillie struck the shallows, Thea was usually prompt in\r\nturning the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Will you and Axel let me have your sled at recess?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"All the time?\" asked Gunner dubiously.\r\n\r\n\"I'll work your examples for you to-night, if you do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, all right. There'll be a lot of 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind, I can work 'em fast. How about yours, Axel?\"\r\n\r\nAxel was a fat little boy of seven, with pretty, lazy blue eyes. \"I\r\ndon't care,\" he murmured, buttering his last buckwheat cake without\r\nambition; \"too much trouble to copy 'em down. Jenny Smiley'll let me\r\nhave hers.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys were to pull Thea to school on their sled, as the snow was\r\ndeep. The three set off together. Anna was now in the high school, and\r\nshe no longer went with the family party, but walked to school with some\r\nof the older girls who were her friends, and wore a hat, not a hood like\r\nThea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\"And it was Summer, beautiful Summer!\" Those were the closing words of\r\nThea's favorite fairy tale, and she thought of them as she ran out into\r\nthe world one Saturday morning in May, her music book under her arm. She\r\nwas going to the Kohlers' to take her lesson, but she was in no hurry.\r\n\r\nIt was in the summer that one really lived. Then all the little\r\novercrowded houses were opened wide, and the wind blew through them with\r\nsweet, earthy smells of garden-planting. The town looked as if it had\r\njust been washed. People were out painting their fences. The cottonwood\r\ntrees were a-flicker with sticky, yellow little leaves, and the feathery\r\ntamarisks were in pink bud. With the warm weather came freedom for\r\neverybody. People were dug up, as it were. The very old people, whom one\r\nhad not seen all winter, came out and sunned themselves in the yard. The\r\ndouble windows were taken off the houses, the tormenting flannels in\r\nwhich children had been encased all winter were put away in boxes, and\r\nthe youngsters felt a pleasure in the cool cotton things next their\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nThea had to walk more than a mile to reach the Kohlers' house, a very\r\npleasant mile out of town toward the glittering sand hills,--yellow this\r\nmorning, with lines of deep violet where the clefts and valleys were.\r\nShe followed the sidewalk to the depot at the south end of the town;\r\nthen took the road east to the little group of adobe houses where the\r\nMexicans lived, then dropped into a deep ravine; a dry sand creek,\r\nacross which the railroad track ran on a trestle. Beyond that gulch, on\r\na little rise of ground that faced the open sandy plain, was the\r\nKohlers' house, where Professor Wunsch lived. Fritz Kohler was the town\r\ntailor, one of the first settlers. He had moved there, built a little\r\nhouse and made a garden, when Moonstone was first marked down on the\r\nmap. He had three sons, but they now worked on the railroad and were\r\nstationed in distant cities. One of them had gone to work for the Santa\r\nFe, and lived in New Mexico.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kohler seldom crossed the ravine and went into the town except at\r\nChristmas-time, when she had to buy presents and Christmas cards to send\r\nto her old friends in Freeport, Illinois. As she did not go to church,\r\nshe did not possess such a thing as a hat. Year after year she wore the\r\nsame red hood in winter and a black sunbonnet in summer. She made her\r\nown dresses; the skirts came barely to her shoe-tops, and were gathered\r\nas full as they could possibly be to the waistband. She preferred men's\r\nshoes, and usually wore the cast-offs of one of her sons. She had never\r\nlearned much English, and her plants and shrubs were her companions. She\r\nlived for her men and her garden. Beside that sand gulch, she had tried\r\nto reproduce a bit of her own village in the Rhine Valley. She hid\r\nherself behind the growth she had fostered, lived under the shade of\r\nwhat she had planted and watered and pruned. In the blaze of the open\r\nplain she was stupid and blind like an owl. Shade, shade; that was what\r\nshe was always planning and making. Behind the high tamarisk hedge, her\r\ngarden was a jungle of verdure in summer. Above the cherry trees and\r\npeach trees and golden plums stood the windmill, with its tank on\r\nstilts, which kept all this verdure alive. Outside, the sage-brush grew\r\nup to the very edge of the garden, and the sand was always drifting up\r\nto the tamarisks.\r\n\r\nEvery one in Moonstone was astonished when the Kohlers took the\r\nwandering music-teacher to live with them. In seventeen years old Fritz\r\nhad never had a crony, except the harness-maker and Spanish Johnny. This\r\nWunsch came from God knew where,--followed Spanish Johnny into town when\r\nthat wanderer came back from one of his tramps. Wunsch played in the\r\ndance orchestra, tuned pianos, and gave lessons. When Mrs. Kohler\r\nrescued him, he was sleeping in a dirty, unfurnished room over one of\r\nthe saloons, and he had only two shirts in the world. Once he was under\r\nher roof, the old woman went at him as she did at her garden. She sewed\r\nand washed and mended for him, and made him so clean and respectable\r\nthat he was able to get a large class of pupils and to rent a piano. As\r\nsoon as he had money ahead, he sent to the Narrow Gauge lodging-house,\r\nin Denver, for a trunkful of music which had been held there for unpaid\r\nboard. With tears in his eyes the old man--he was not over fifty, but\r\nsadly battered--told Mrs. Kohler that he asked nothing better of God\r\nthan to end his days with her, and to be buried in the garden, under her\r\nlinden trees. They were not American basswood, but the European linden,\r\nwhich has honey-colored blooms in summer, with a fragrance that\r\nsurpasses all trees and flowers and drives young people wild with joy.\r\n\r\nThea was reflecting as she walked along that had it not been for\r\nProfessor Wunsch she might have lived on for years in Moonstone without\r\never knowing the Kohlers, without ever seeing their garden or the inside\r\nof their house. Besides the cuckoo clock,--which was wonderful enough,\r\nand which Mrs. Kohler said she kept for \"company when she was\r\nlonesome,\"--the Kohlers had in their house the most wonderful thing Thea\r\nhad ever seen--but of that later.\r\n\r\nProfessor Wunsch went to the houses of his other pupils to give them\r\ntheir lessons, but one morning he told Mrs. Kronborg that Thea had\r\ntalent, and that if she came to him he could teach her in his slippers,\r\nand that would be better. Mrs. Kronborg was a strange woman. That word\r\n\"talent,\" which no one else in Moonstone, not even Dr. Archie, would\r\nhave understood, she comprehended perfectly. To any other woman there,\r\nit would have meant that a child must have her hair curled every day and\r\nmust play in public. Mrs. Kronborg knew it meant that Thea must practice\r\nfour hours a day. A child with talent must be kept at the piano, just as\r\na child with measles must be kept under the blankets. Mrs. Kronborg and\r\nher three sisters had all studied piano, and all sang well, but none of\r\nthem had talent. Their father had played the oboe in an orchestra in\r\nSweden, before he came to America to better his fortunes. He had even\r\nknown Jenny Lind. A child with talent had to be kept at the piano; so\r\ntwice a week in summer and once a week in winter Thea went over the\r\ngulch to the Kohlers', though the Ladies' Aid Society thought it was not\r\nproper for their preacher's daughter to go \"where there was so much\r\ndrinking.\" Not that the Kohler sons ever so much as looked at a glass of\r\nbeer. They were ashamed of their old folks and got out into the world as\r\nfast as possible; had their clothes made by a Denver tailor and their\r\nnecks shaved up under their hair and forgot the past. Old Fritz and\r\nWunsch, however, indulged in a friendly bottle pretty often. The two men\r\nwere like comrades; perhaps the bond between them was the glass wherein\r\nlost hopes are found; perhaps it was common memories of another country;\r\nperhaps it was the grapevine in the garden--knotty, fibrous shrub, full\r\nof homesickness and sentiment, which the Germans have carried around the\r\nworld with them.\r\n\r\nAs Thea approached the house she peeped between the pink sprays of the\r\ntamarisk hedge and saw the Professor and Mrs. Kohler in the garden,\r\nspading and raking. The garden looked like a relief-map now, and gave no\r\nindication of what it would be in August; such a jungle! Pole beans and\r\npotatoes and corn and leeks and kale and red cabbage--there would even\r\nbe vegetables for which there is no American name. Mrs. Kohler was\r\nalways getting by mail packages of seeds from Freeport and from the old\r\ncountry. Then the flowers! There were big sunflowers for the canary\r\nbird, tiger lilies and phlox and zinnias and lady's-slippers and\r\nportulaca and hollyhocks,--giant hollyhocks. Beside the fruit trees\r\nthere was a great umbrella-shaped catalpa, and a balm-of-Gilead, two\r\nlindens, and even a ginka,--a rigid, pointed tree with leaves shaped\r\nlike butterflies, which shivered, but never bent to the wind.\r\n\r\nThis morning Thea saw to her delight that the two oleander trees, one\r\nwhite and one red, had been brought up from their winter quarters in the\r\ncellar. There is hardly a German family in the most arid parts of Utah,\r\nNew Mexico, Arizona, but has its oleander trees. However loutish the\r\nAmerican-born sons of the family may be, there was never one who refused\r\nto give his muscle to the back-breaking task of getting those tubbed\r\ntrees down into the cellar in the fall and up into the sunlight in the\r\nspring. They may strive to avert the day, but they grapple with the tub\r\nat last.\r\n\r\nWhen Thea entered the gate, her professor leaned his spade against the\r\nwhite post that supported the turreted dove-house, and wiped his face\r\nwith his shirt-sleeve; someway he never managed to have a handkerchief\r\nabout him. Wunsch was short and stocky, with something rough and\r\nbear-like about his shoulders. His face was a dark, bricky red, deeply\r\ncreased rather than wrinkled, and the skin was like loose leather over\r\nhis neck band--he wore a brass collar button but no collar. His hair was\r\ncropped close; iron-gray bristles on a bullet-like head. His eyes were\r\nalways suffused and bloodshot. He had a coarse, scornful mouth, and\r\nirregular, yellow teeth, much worn at the edges. His hands were square\r\nand red, seldom clean, but always alive, impatient, even sympathetic.\r\n\r\n\"MORGEN,\" he greeted his pupil in a businesslike way, put on a black\r\nalpaca coat, and conducted her at once to the piano in Mrs. Kohler's\r\nsitting-room. He twirled the stool to the proper height, pointed to it,\r\nand sat down in a wooden chair beside Thea.\r\n\r\n\"The scale of B flat major,\" he directed, and then fell into an attitude\r\nof deep attention. Without a word his pupil set to work.\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. Kohler, in the garden, came the cheerful sound of effort, of\r\nvigorous striving. Unconsciously she wielded her rake more lightly.\r\nOccasionally she heard the teacher's voice. \"Scale of E minor...WEITER,\r\nWEITER!...IMMER I hear the thumb, like a lame foot. WEITER...WEITER,\r\nonce...SCHON! The chords, quick!\"\r\n\r\nThe pupil did not open her mouth until they began the second movement of\r\nthe Clementi sonata, when she remonstrated in low tones about the way he\r\nhad marked the fingering of a passage.\r\n\r\n\"It makes no matter what you think,\" replied her teacher coldly. \"There\r\nis only one right way. The thumb there. EIN, ZWEI, DREI, VIER,\" etc.\r\nThen for an hour there was no further interruption.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the lesson Thea turned on her stool and leaned her arm on\r\nthe keyboard. They usually had a little talk after the lesson.\r\n\r\nHerr Wunsch grinned. \"How soon is it you are free from school? Then we\r\nmake ahead faster, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"First week in June. Then will you give me the 'Invitation to the\r\nDance'?\"\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \"It makes no matter. If you want him, you\r\nplay him out of lesson hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right.\" Thea fumbled in her pocket and brought out a crumpled slip\r\nof paper. \"What does this mean, please? I guess it's Latin.\"\r\n\r\nWunsch blinked at the line penciled on the paper. \"Wherefrom you get\r\nthis?\" he asked gruffly.\r\n\r\n\"Out of a book Dr. Archie gave me to read. It's all English but that.\r\nDid you ever see it before?\" she asked, watching his face.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. A long time ago,\" he muttered, scowling. \"Ovidius!\" He took a stub\r\nof lead pencil from his vest pocket, steadied his hand by a visible\r\neffort, and under the words:\r\n\r\n\"LENTE CURRITE, LENTE CURRITE, NOCTIS EQUI,\" he wrote in a clear,\r\nelegant Gothic hand,--\r\n\r\n\"GO SLOWLY, GO SLOWLY, YE STEEDS OF THE NIGHT.\"\r\n\r\nHe put the pencil back in his pocket and continued to stare at the\r\nLatin. It recalled the poem, which he had read as a student, and thought\r\nvery fine. There were treasures of memory which no lodging-house keeper\r\ncould attach. One carried things about in one's head, long after one's\r\nlinen could be smuggled out in a tuning-bag. He handed the paper back\r\nto Thea. \"There is the English, quite elegant,\" he said, rising.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kohler stuck her head in at the door, and Thea slid off the stool.\r\n\"Come in, Mrs. Kohler,\" she called, \"and show me the piece-picture.\"\r\n\r\nThe old woman laughed, pulled off her big gardening gloves, and pushed\r\nThea to the lounge before the object of her delight. The\r\n\"piece-picture,\" which hung on the wall and nearly covered one whole end\r\nof the room, was the handiwork of Fritz Kohler. He had learned his trade\r\nunder an old-fashioned tailor in Magdeburg who required from each of his\r\napprentices a thesis: that is, before they left his shop, each\r\napprentice had to copy in cloth some well known German painting,\r\nstitching bits of colored stuff together on a linen background; a kind\r\nof mosaic. The pupil was allowed to select his subject, and Fritz Kohler\r\nhad chosen a popular painting of Napoleon's retreat from Moscow. The\r\ngloomy Emperor and his staff were represented as crossing a stone\r\nbridge, and behind them was the blazing city, the walls and fortresses\r\ndone in gray cloth with orange tongues of flame darting about the domes\r\nand minarets. Napoleon rode his white horse; Murat, in Oriental dress, a\r\nbay charger. Thea was never tired of examining this work, of hearing how\r\nlong it had taken Fritz to make it, how much it had been admired, and\r\nwhat narrow escapes it had had from moths and fire. Silk, Mrs. Kohler\r\nexplained, would have been much easier to manage than woolen cloth, in\r\nwhich it was often hard to get the right shades. The reins of the\r\nhorses, the wheels of the spurs, the brooding eyebrows of the Emperor,\r\nMurat's fierce mustaches, the great shakos of the Guard, were all worked\r\nout with the minutest fidelity. Thea's admiration for this picture had\r\nendeared her to Mrs. Kohler. It was now many years since she used to\r\npoint out its wonders to her own little boys. As Mrs. Kohler did not go\r\nto church, she never heard any singing, except the songs that floated\r\nover from Mexican Town, and Thea often sang for her after the lesson was\r\nover. This morning Wunsch pointed to the piano.\r\n\r\n\"On Sunday, when I go by the church, I hear you sing something.\"\r\n\r\nThea obediently sat down on the stool again and began, \"COME, YE\r\nDISCONSOLATE.\" Wunsch listened thoughtfully, his hands on his knees.\r\nSuch a beautiful child's voice! Old Mrs. Kohler's face relaxed in a\r\nsmile of happiness; she half closed her eyes. A big fly was darting in\r\nand out of the window; the sunlight made a golden pool on the rag carpet\r\nand bathed the faded cretonne pillows on the lounge, under the\r\npiece-picture. \"EARTH HAS NO SORROW THAT HEAVEN CANNOT HEAL,\" the song\r\ndied away.\r\n\r\n\"That is a good thing to remember,\" Wunsch shook himself. \"You believe\r\nthat?\" looking quizzically at Thea.\r\n\r\nShe became confused and pecked nervously at a black key with her middle\r\nfinger. \"I don't know. I guess so,\" she murmured.\r\n\r\nHer teacher rose abruptly. \"Remember, for next time, thirds. You ought\r\nto get up earlier.\"\r\n\r\nThat night the air was so warm that Fritz and Herr Wunsch had their\r\nafter-supper pipe in the grape arbor, smoking in silence while the sound\r\nof fiddles and guitars came across the ravine from Mexican Town. Long\r\nafter Fritz and his old Paulina had gone to bed, Wunsch sat motionless\r\nin the arbor, looking up through the woolly vine leaves at the\r\nglittering machinery of heaven.\r\n\r\n\"LENTE CURRITE, NOCTIS EQUI.\"\r\n\r\nThat line awoke many memories. He was thinking of youth; of his own, so\r\nlong gone by, and of his pupil's, just beginning. He would even have\r\ncherished hopes for her, except that he had become superstitious. He\r\nbelieved that whatever he hoped for was destined not to be; that his\r\naffection brought ill-fortune, especially to the young; that if he held\r\nanything in his thoughts, he harmed it. He had taught in music schools\r\nin St. Louis and Kansas City, where the shallowness and complacency of\r\nthe young misses had maddened him. He had encountered bad manners and\r\nbad faith, had been the victim of sharpers of all kinds, was dogged by\r\nbad luck. He had played in orchestras that were never paid and wandering\r\nopera troupes which disbanded penniless. And there was always the old\r\nenemy, more relentless than the others. It was long since he had wished\r\nanything or desired anything beyond the necessities of the body. Now\r\nthat he was tempted to hope for another, he felt alarmed and shook his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nIt was his pupil's power of application, her rugged will, that\r\ninterested him. He had lived for so long among people whose sole\r\nambition was to get something for nothing that he had learned not to\r\nlook for seriousness in anything. Now that he by chance encountered it,\r\nit recalled standards, ambitions, a society long forgot. What was it she\r\nreminded him of? A yellow flower, full of sunlight, perhaps. No; a thin\r\nglass full of sweet-smelling, sparkling Moselle wine. He seemed to see\r\nsuch a glass before him in the arbor, to watch the bubbles rising and\r\nbreaking, like the silent discharge of energy in the nerves and brain,\r\nthe rapid florescence in young blood--Wunsch felt ashamed and dragged\r\nhis slippers along the path to the kitchen, his eyes on the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe children in the primary grades were sometimes required to make\r\nrelief maps of Moonstone in sand. Had they used colored sands, as the\r\nNavajo medicine men do in their sand mosaics, they could easily have\r\nindicated the social classifications of Moonstone, since these conformed\r\nto certain topographical boundaries, and every child understood them\r\nperfectly.\r\n\r\nThe main business street ran, of course, through the center of the town.\r\nTo the west of this street lived all the people who were, as Tillie\r\nKronborg said, \"in society.\" Sylvester Street, the third parallel with\r\nMain Street on the west, was the longest in town, and the best dwellings\r\nwere built along it. Far out at the north end, nearly a mile from the\r\ncourt-house and its cottonwood grove, was Dr. Archie's house, its big\r\nyard and garden surrounded by a white paling fence. The Methodist Church\r\nwas in the center of the town, facing the court-house square. The\r\nKronborgs lived half a mile south of the church, on the long street that\r\nstretched out like an arm to the depot settlement. This was the first\r\nstreet west of Main, and was built up only on one side. The preacher's\r\nhouse faced the backs of the brick and frame store buildings and a draw\r\nfull of sunflowers and scraps of old iron. The sidewalk which ran in\r\nfront of the Kronborgs' house was the one continuous sidewalk to the\r\ndepot, and all the train men and roundhouse employees passed the front\r\ngate every time they came uptown. Thea and Mrs. Kronborg had many\r\nfriends among the railroad men, who often paused to chat across the\r\nfence, and of one of these we shall have more to say.\r\n\r\nIn the part of Moonstone that lay east of Main Street, toward the deep\r\nravine which, farther south, wound by Mexican Town, lived all the\r\nhumbler citizens, the people who voted but did not run for office. The\r\nhouses were little story-and-a-half cottages, with none of the fussy\r\narchitectural efforts that marked those on Sylvester Street. They\r\nnestled modestly behind their cottonwoods and Virginia creeper; their\r\noccupants had no social pretensions to keep up. There were no half-glass\r\nfront doors with doorbells, or formidable parlors behind closed\r\nshutters. Here the old women washed in the back yard, and the men sat in\r\nthe front doorway and smoked their pipes. The people on Sylvester Street\r\nscarcely knew that this part of the town existed. Thea liked to take\r\nThor and her express wagon and explore these quiet, shady streets, where\r\nthe people never tried to have lawns or to grow elms and pine trees, but\r\nlet the native timber have its way and spread in luxuriance. She had\r\nmany friends there, old women who gave her a yellow rose or a spray of\r\ntrumpet vine and appeased Thor with a cooky or a doughnut. They called\r\nThea \"that preacher's girl,\" but the demonstrative was misplaced, for\r\nwhen they spoke of Mr. Kronborg they called him \"the Methodist\r\npreacher.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie was very proud of his yard and garden, which he worked\r\nhimself. He was the only man in Moonstone who was successful at growing\r\nrambler roses, and his strawberries were famous. One morning when Thea\r\nwas downtown on an errand, the doctor stopped her, took her hand and\r\nwent over her with a quizzical eye, as he nearly always did when they\r\nmet.\r\n\r\n\"You haven't been up to my place to get any strawberries yet, Thea.\r\nThey're at their best just now. Mrs. Archie doesn't know what to do with\r\nthem all. Come up this afternoon. Just tell Mrs. Archie I sent you.\r\nBring a big basket and pick till you are tired.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she got home Thea told her mother that she didn't want to go,\r\nbecause she didn't like Mrs. Archie.\r\n\r\n\"She is certainly one queer woman,\" Mrs. Kronborg assented, \"but he's\r\nasked you so often, I guess you'll have to go this time. She won't bite\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Thea took a basket, put Thor in his baby buggy, and set out\r\nfor Dr. Archie's house at the other end of town. As soon as she came\r\nwithin sight of the house, she slackened her pace. She approached it\r\nvery slowly, stopping often to pick dandelions and sand-peas for Thor to\r\ncrush up in his fist.\r\n\r\nIt was his wife's custom, as soon as Dr. Archie left the house in the\r\nmorning, to shut all the doors and windows to keep the dust out, and to\r\npull down the shades to keep the sun from fading the carpets. She\r\nthought, too, that neighbors were less likely to drop in if the house\r\nwas closed up. She was one of those people who are stingy without motive\r\nor reason, even when they can gain nothing by it. She must have known\r\nthat skimping the doctor in heat and food made him more extravagant than\r\nhe would have been had she made him comfortable. He never came home for\r\nlunch, because she gave him such miserable scraps and shreds of food. No\r\nmatter how much milk he bought, he could never get thick cream for his\r\nstrawberries. Even when he watched his wife lift it from the milk in\r\nsmooth, ivory-colored blankets, she managed, by some sleight-of-hand, to\r\ndilute it before it got to the breakfast table. The butcher's favorite\r\njoke was about the kind of meat he sold Mrs. Archie. She felt no\r\ninterest in food herself, and she hated to prepare it. She liked nothing\r\nbetter than to have Dr. Archie go to Denver for a few days--he often\r\nwent chiefly because he was hungry--and to be left alone to eat canned\r\nsalmon and to keep the house shut up from morning until night.\r\n\r\nMrs. Archie would not have a servant because, she said, \"they ate too\r\nmuch and broke too much\"; she even said they knew too much. She used\r\nwhat mind she had in devising shifts to minimize her housework. She used\r\nto tell her neighbors that if there were no men, there would be no\r\nhousework. When Mrs. Archie was first married, she had been always in a\r\npanic for fear she would have children. Now that her apprehensions on\r\nthat score had grown paler, she was almost as much afraid of having dust\r\nin the house as she had once been of having children in it. If dust did\r\nnot get in, it did not have to be got out, she said. She would take any\r\namount of trouble to avoid trouble. Why, nobody knew. Certainly her\r\nhusband had never been able to make her out. Such little, mean natures\r\nare among the darkest and most baffling of created things. There is no\r\nlaw by which they can be explained. The ordinary incentives of pain and\r\npleasure do not account for their behavior. They live like insects,\r\nabsorbed in petty activities that seem to have nothing to do with any\r\ngenial aspect of human life.\r\n\r\nMrs. Archie, as Mrs. Kronborg said, \"liked to gad.\" She liked to have\r\nher house clean, empty, dark, locked, and to be out of it--anywhere. A\r\nchurch social, a prayer meeting, a ten-cent show; she seemed to have no\r\npreference. When there was nowhere else to go, she used to sit for hours\r\nin Mrs. Smiley's millinery and notion store, listening to the talk of\r\nthe women who came in, watching them while they tried on hats, blinking\r\nat them from her corner with her sharp, restless little eyes. She never\r\ntalked much herself, but she knew all the gossip of the town and she had\r\na sharp ear for racy anecdotes--\"traveling men's stories,\" they used to\r\nbe called in Moonstone. Her clicking laugh sounded like a typewriting\r\nmachine in action, and, for very pointed stories, she had a little\r\nscreech.\r\n\r\nMrs. Archie had been Mrs. Archie for only six years, and when she was\r\nBelle White she was one of the \"pretty\" girls in Lansing, Michigan. She\r\nhad then a train of suitors. She could truly remind Archie that \"the\r\nboys hung around her.\" They did. They thought her very spirited and were\r\nalways saying, \"Oh, that Belle White, she's a case!\" She used to play\r\nheavy practical jokes which the young men thought very clever. Archie\r\nwas considered the most promising young man in \"the young crowd,\" so\r\nBelle selected him. She let him see, made him fully aware, that she had\r\nselected him, and Archie was the sort of boy who could not withstand\r\nsuch enlightenment. Belle's family were sorry for him. On his wedding\r\nday her sisters looked at the big, handsome boy--he was twenty-four--as\r\nhe walked down the aisle with his bride, and then they looked at each\r\nother. His besotted confidence, his sober, radiant face, his gentle,\r\nprotecting arm, made them uncomfortable. Well, they were glad that he\r\nwas going West at once, to fulfill his doom where they would not be\r\nonlookers. Anyhow, they consoled themselves, they had got Belle off\r\ntheir hands.\r\n\r\nMore than that, Belle seemed to have got herself off her hands. Her\r\nreputed prettiness must have been entirely the result of determination,\r\nof a fierce little ambition. Once she had married, fastened herself on\r\nsome one, come to port,--it vanished like the ornamental plumage which\r\ndrops away from some birds after the mating season. The one aggressive\r\naction of her life was over. She began to shrink in face and stature. Of\r\nher harum-scarum spirit there was nothing left but the little screech.\r\nWithin a few years she looked as small and mean as she was.\r\n\r\nThor's chariot crept along. Thea approached the house unwillingly. She\r\ndidn't care about the strawberries, anyhow. She had come only because\r\nshe did not want to hurt Dr. Archie's feelings. She not only disliked\r\nMrs. Archie, she was a little afraid of her. While Thea was getting the\r\nheavy baby-buggy through the iron gate she heard some one call, \"Wait a\r\nminute!\" and Mrs. Archie came running around the house from the back\r\ndoor, her apron over her head. She came to help with the buggy, because\r\nshe was afraid the wheels might scratch the paint off the gateposts. She\r\nwas a skinny little woman with a great pile of frizzy light hair on a\r\nsmall head.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Archie told me to come up and pick some strawberries,\" Thea\r\nmuttered, wishing she had stayed at home.\r\n\r\nMrs. Archie led the way to the back door, squinting and shading her eyes\r\nwith her hand. \"Wait a minute,\" she said again, when Thea explained why\r\nshe had come.\r\n\r\nShe went into her kitchen and Thea sat down on the porch step. When Mrs.\r\nArchie reappeared she carried in her hand a little wooden butter-basket\r\ntrimmed with fringed tissue paper, which she must have brought home from\r\nsome church supper. \"You'll have to have something to put them in,\" she\r\nsaid, ignoring the yawning willow basket which stood empty on Thor's\r\nfeet. \"You can have this, and you needn't mind about returning it. You\r\nknow about not trampling the vines, don't you?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Archie went back into the house and Thea leaned over in the sand\r\nand picked a few strawberries. As soon as she was sure that she was not\r\ngoing to cry, she tossed the little basket into the big one and ran\r\nThor's buggy along the gravel walk and out of the gate as fast as she\r\ncould push it. She was angry, and she was ashamed for Dr. Archie. She\r\ncould not help thinking how uncomfortable he would be if he ever found\r\nout about it. Little things like that were the ones that cut him most.\r\nShe slunk home by the back way, and again almost cried when she told her\r\nmother about it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kronborg was frying doughnuts for her husband's supper. She laughed\r\nas she dropped a new lot into the hot grease. \"It's wonderful, the way\r\nsome people are made,\" she declared. \"But I wouldn't let that upset me\r\nif I was you. Think what it would be to live with it all the time. You\r\nlook in the black pocketbook inside my handbag and take a dime and go\r\ndowntown and get an ice-cream soda. That'll make you feel better. Thor\r\ncan have a little of the ice-cream if you feed it to him with a spoon.\r\nHe likes it, don't you, son?\" She stooped to wipe his chin. Thor was\r\nonly six months old and inarticulate, but it was quite true that he\r\nliked ice-cream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nSeen from a balloon, Moonstone would have looked like a Noah's ark town\r\nset out in the sand and lightly shaded by gray-green tamarisks and\r\ncottonwoods. A few people were trying to make soft maples grow in their\r\nturfed lawns, but the fashion of planting incongruous trees from the\r\nNorth Atlantic States had not become general then, and the frail,\r\nbrightly painted desert town was shaded by the light-reflecting,\r\nwind-loving trees of the desert, whose roots are always seeking water\r\nand whose leaves are always talking about it, making the sound of rain.\r\nThe long porous roots of the cottonwood are irrepressible. They break\r\ninto the wells as rats do into granaries, and thieve the water.\r\n\r\nThe long street which connected Moonstone with the depot settlement\r\ntraversed in its course a considerable stretch of rough open country,\r\nstaked out in lots but not built up at all, a weedy hiatus between the\r\ntown and the railroad. When you set out along this street to go to the\r\nstation, you noticed that the houses became smaller and farther apart,\r\nuntil they ceased altogether, and the board sidewalk continued its\r\nuneven course through sunflower patches, until you reached the solitary,\r\nnew brick Catholic Church. The church stood there because the land was\r\ngiven to the parish by the man who owned the adjoining waste lots, in\r\nthe hope of making them more salable--\"Farrier's Addition,\" this patch\r\nof prairie was called in the clerk's office. An eighth of a mile beyond\r\nthe church was a washout, a deep sand-gully, where the board sidewalk\r\nbecame a bridge for perhaps fifty feet. Just beyond the gully was old\r\nUncle Billy Beemer's grove,--twelve town lots set out in fine,\r\nwell-grown cottonwood trees, delightful to look upon, or to listen to,\r\nas they swayed and rippled in the wind. Uncle Billy had been one of the\r\nmost worthless old drunkards who ever sat on a store box and told filthy\r\nstories. One night he played hide-and-seek with a switch engine and got\r\nhis sodden brains knocked out. But his grove, the one creditable thing\r\nhe had ever done in his life, rustled on. Beyond this grove the houses\r\nof the depot settlement began, and the naked board walk, that had run in\r\nout of the sunflowers, again became a link between human dwellings.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, late in the summer, Dr. Howard Archie was fighting his\r\nway back to town along this walk through a blinding sandstorm, a silk\r\nhandkerchief tied over his mouth. He had been to see a sick woman down\r\nin the depot settlement, and he was walking because his ponies had been\r\nout for a hard drive that morning.\r\n\r\nAs he passed the Catholic Church he came upon Thea and Thor. Thea was\r\nsitting in a child's express wagon, her feet out behind, kicking the\r\nwagon along and steering by the tongue. Thor was on her lap and she held\r\nhim with one arm. He had grown to be a big cub of a baby, with a\r\nconstitutional grievance, and he had to be continually amused. Thea took\r\nhim philosophically, and tugged and pulled him about, getting as much\r\nfun as she could under her encumbrance. Her hair was blowing about her\r\nface, and her eyes were squinting so intently at the uneven board\r\nsidewalk in front of her that she did not see the doctor until he spoke\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n\"Look out, Thea. You'll steer that youngster into the ditch.\"\r\n\r\nThe wagon stopped. Thea released the tongue, wiped her hot, sandy face,\r\nand pushed back her hair. \"Oh, no, I won't! I never ran off but once,\r\nand then he didn't get anything but a bump. He likes this better than a\r\nbaby buggy, and so do I.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to kick that cart all the way home?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. We take long trips; wherever there is a sidewalk. It's no\r\ngood on the road.\"\r\n\r\n\"Looks to me like working pretty hard for your fun. Are you going to be\r\nbusy to-night? Want to make a call with me? Spanish Johnny's come home\r\nagain, all used up. His wife sent me word this morning, and I said I'd\r\ngo over to see him to-night. He's an old chum of yours, isn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm glad. She's been crying her eyes out. When did he come?\"\r\n\r\n\"Last night, on Number Six. Paid his fare, they tell me. Too sick to\r\nbeat it. There'll come a time when that boy won't get back, I'm afraid.\r\nCome around to my office about eight o'clock,--and you needn't bring\r\nthat!\"\r\n\r\nThor seemed to understand that he had been insulted, for he scowled and\r\nbegan to kick the side of the wagon, shouting, \"Go-go, go-go!\" Thea\r\nleaned forward and grabbed the wagon tongue. Dr. Archie stepped in front\r\nof her and blocked the way. \"Why don't you make him wait? What do you\r\nlet him boss you like that for?\"\r\n\r\n\"If he gets mad he throws himself, and then I can't do anything with\r\nhim. When he's mad he's lots stronger than me, aren't you, Thor?\" Thea\r\nspoke with pride, and the idol was appeased. He grunted approvingly as\r\nhis sister began to kick rapidly behind her, and the wagon rattled off\r\nand soon disappeared in the flying currents of sand.\r\n\r\nThat evening Dr. Archie was seated in his office, his desk chair tilted\r\nback, reading by the light of a hot coal-oil lamp. All the windows were\r\nopen, but the night was breathless after the sandstorm, and his hair was\r\nmoist where it hung over his forehead. He was deeply engrossed in his\r\nbook and sometimes smiled thoughtfully as he read. When Thea Kronborg\r\nentered quietly and slipped into a seat, he nodded, finished his\r\nparagraph, inserted a bookmark, and rose to put the book back into the\r\ncase. It was one out of the long row of uniform volumes on the top\r\nshelf.\r\n\r\n\"Nearly every time I come in, when you're alone, you're reading one of\r\nthose books,\" Thea remarked thoughtfully. \"They must be very nice.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor dropped back into his swivel chair, the mottled volume still\r\nin his hand. \"They aren't exactly books, Thea,\" he said seriously.\r\n\"They're a city.\"\r\n\r\n\"A history, you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and no. They're a history of a live city, not a dead one. A\r\nFrenchman undertook to write about a whole cityful of people, all the\r\nkinds he knew. And he got them nearly all in, I guess. Yes, it's very\r\ninteresting. You'll like to read it some day, when you're grown up.\"\r\n\r\nThea leaned forward and made out the title on the back, \"A Distinguished\r\nProvincial in Paris.\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't sound very interesting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not, but it is.\" The doctor scrutinized her broad face, low\r\nenough to be in the direct light from under the green lamp shade. \"Yes,\"\r\nhe went on with some satisfaction, \"I think you'll like them some day.\r\nYou're always curious about people, and I expect this man knew more\r\nabout people than anybody that ever lived.\"\r\n\r\n\"City people or country people?\"\r\n\r\n\"Both. People are pretty much the same everywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, they're not. The people who go through in the dining-car aren't\r\nlike us.\"\r\n\r\n\"What makes you think they aren't, my girl? Their clothes?\"\r\n\r\nThea shook her head. \"No, it's something else. I don't know.\" Her eyes\r\nshifted under the doctor's searching gaze and she glanced up at the row\r\nof books. \"How soon will I be old enough to read them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Soon enough, soon enough, little girl.\" The doctor patted her hand and\r\nlooked at her index finger. \"The nail's coming all right, isn't it? But\r\nI think that man makes you practice too much. You have it on your mind\r\nall the time.\" He had noticed that when she talked to him she was always\r\nopening and shutting her hands. \"It makes you nervous.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he don't,\" Thea replied stubbornly, watching Dr. Archie return the\r\nbook to its niche.\r\n\r\nHe took up a black leather case, put on his hat, and they went down the\r\ndark stairs into the street. The summer moon hung full in the sky. For\r\nthe time being, it was the great fact in the world. Beyond the edge of\r\nthe town the plain was so white that every clump of sage stood out\r\ndistinct from the sand, and the dunes looked like a shining lake. The\r\ndoctor took off his straw hat and carried it in his hand as they walked\r\ntoward Mexican Town, across the sand.\r\n\r\nNorth of Pueblo, Mexican settlements were rare in Colorado then. This\r\none had come about accidentally. Spanish Johnny was the first Mexican\r\nwho came to Moonstone. He was a painter and decorator, and had been\r\nworking in Trinidad, when Ray Kennedy told him there was a \"boom\" on in\r\nMoonstone, and a good many new buildings were going up. A year after\r\nJohnny settled in Moonstone, his cousin, Famos Serrenos, came to work in\r\nthe brickyard; then Serrenos' cousins came to help him. During the\r\nstrike, the master mechanic put a gang of Mexicans to work in the\r\nroundhouse. The Mexicans had arrived so quietly, with their blankets and\r\nmusical instruments, that before Moonstone was awake to the fact, there\r\nwas a Mexican quarter; a dozen families or more.\r\n\r\nAs Thea and the doctor approached the 'dobe houses, they heard a guitar,\r\nand a rich barytone voice--that of Famos Serrenos--singing \"La\r\nGolandrina.\" All the Mexican houses had neat little yards, with tamarisk\r\nhedges and flowers, and walks bordered with shells or whitewashed\r\nstones. Johnny's house was dark. His wife, Mrs. Tellamantez, was sitting\r\non the doorstep, combing her long, blue-black hair. (Mexican women are\r\nlike the Spartans; when they are in trouble, in love, under stress of\r\nany kind, they comb and comb their hair.) She rose without embarrassment\r\nor apology, comb in hand, and greeted the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Good-evening; will you go in?\" she asked in a low, musical voice. \"He\r\nis in the back room. I will make a light.\" She followed them indoors,\r\nlit a candle and handed it to the doctor, pointing toward the bedroom.\r\nThen she went back and sat down on her doorstep.\r\n\r\nDr. Archie and Thea went into the bedroom, which was dark and quiet.\r\nThere was a bed in the corner, and a man was lying on the clean sheets.\r\nOn the table beside him was a glass pitcher, half-full of water. Spanish\r\nJohnny looked younger than his wife, and when he was in health he was\r\nvery handsome: slender, gold-colored, with wavy black hair, a round,\r\nsmooth throat, white teeth, and burning black eyes. His profile was\r\nstrong and severe, like an Indian's. What was termed his \"wildness\"\r\nshowed itself only in his feverish eyes and in the color that burned on\r\nhis tawny cheeks. That night he was a coppery green, and his eyes were\r\nlike black holes. He opened them when the doctor held the candle before\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n\"MI TESTA!\" he muttered, \"MI TESTA,\" doctor. \"LA FIEBRE!\" Seeing the\r\ndoctor's companion at the foot of the bed, he attempted a smile.\r\n\"MUCHACHA!\" he exclaimed deprecatingly.\r\n\r\nDr. Archie stuck a thermometer into his mouth. \"Now, Thea, you can run\r\noutside and wait for me.\"\r\n\r\nThea slipped noiselessly through the dark house and joined Mrs.\r\nTellamantez. The somber Mexican woman did not seem inclined to talk, but\r\nher nod was friendly. Thea sat down on the warm sand, her back to the\r\nmoon, facing Mrs. Tellamantez on her doorstep, and began to count the\r\nmoon flowers on the vine that ran over the house. Mrs. Tellamantez was\r\nalways considered a very homely woman. Her face was of a strongly marked\r\ntype not sympathetic to Americans. Such long, oval faces, with a full\r\nchin, a large, mobile mouth, a high nose, are not uncommon in Spain.\r\nMrs. Tellamantez could not write her name, and could read but little.\r\nHer strong nature lived upon itself. She was chiefly known in Moonstone\r\nfor her forbearance with her incorrigible husband.\r\n\r\nNobody knew exactly what was the matter with Johnny, and everybody liked\r\nhim. His popularity would have been unusual for a white man, for a\r\nMexican it was unprecedented. His talents were his undoing. He had a\r\nhigh, uncertain tenor voice, and he played the mandolin with exceptional\r\nskill. Periodically he went crazy. There was no other way to explain his\r\nbehavior. He was a clever workman, and, when he worked, as regular and\r\nfaithful as a burro. Then some night he would fall in with a crowd at\r\nthe saloon and begin to sing. He would go on until he had no voice left,\r\nuntil he wheezed and rasped. Then he would play his mandolin furiously,\r\nand drink until his eyes sank back into his head. At last, when he was\r\nput out of the saloon at closing time, and could get nobody to listen to\r\nhim, he would run away--along the railroad track, straight across the\r\ndesert. He always managed to get aboard a freight somewhere. Once beyond\r\nDenver, he played his way southward from saloon to saloon until he got\r\nacross the border. He never wrote to his wife; but she would soon begin\r\nto get newspapers from La Junta, Albuquerque, Chihuahua, with marked\r\nparagraphs announcing that Juan Tellamantez and his wonderful mandolin\r\ncould be heard at the Jack Rabbit Grill, or the Pearl of Cadiz Saloon.\r\nMrs. Tellamantez waited and wept and combed her hair. When he was\r\ncompletely wrung out and burned up,--all but destroyed,--her Juan always\r\ncame back to her to be taken care of,--once with an ugly knife wound in\r\nthe neck, once with a finger missing from his right hand,--but he played\r\njust as well with three fingers as he had with four.\r\n\r\nPublic sentiment was lenient toward Johnny, but everybody was disgusted\r\nwith Mrs. Tellamantez for putting up with him. She ought to discipline\r\nhim, people said; she ought to leave him; she had no self-respect. In\r\nshort, Mrs. Tellamantez got all the blame. Even Thea thought she was\r\nmuch too humble. To-night, as she sat with her back to the moon, looking\r\nat the moon flowers and Mrs. Tellamantez's somber face, she was thinking\r\nthat there is nothing so sad in the world as that kind of patience and\r\nresignation. It was much worse than Johnny's craziness. She even\r\nwondered whether it did not help to make Johnny crazy. People had no\r\nright to be so passive and resigned. She would like to roll over and\r\nover in the sand and screech at Mrs. Tellamantez. She was glad when the\r\ndoctor came out.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican woman rose and stood respectful and expectant. The doctor\r\nheld his hat in his hand and looked kindly at her.\r\n\r\n\"Same old thing, Mrs. Tellamantez. He's no worse than he's been before.\r\nI've left some medicine. Don't give him anything but toast water until I\r\nsee him again. You're a good nurse; you'll get him out.\" Dr. Archie\r\nsmiled encouragingly. He glanced about the little garden and wrinkled\r\nhis brows. \"I can't see what makes him behave so. He's killing himself,\r\nand he's not a rowdy sort of fellow. Can't you tie him up someway? Can't\r\nyou tell when these fits are coming on?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Tellamantez put her hand to her forehead. \"The saloon, doctor, the\r\nexcitement; that is what makes him. People listen to him, and it excites\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor shook his head. \"Maybe. He's too much for my calculations. I\r\ndon't see what he gets out of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is always fooled,\"--the Mexican woman spoke rapidly and tremulously,\r\nher long under lip quivering.\r\n\r\n\"He is good at heart, but he has no head. He fools himself. You do not\r\nunderstand in this country, you are progressive. But he has no judgment,\r\nand he is fooled.\" She stooped quickly, took up one of the white\r\nconch-shells that bordered the walk, and, with an apologetic inclination\r\nof her head, held it to Dr. Archie's ear. \"Listen, doctor. You hear\r\nsomething in there? You hear the sea; and yet the sea is very far from\r\nhere. You have judgment, and you know that. But he is fooled. To him, it\r\nis the sea itself. A little thing is big to him.\" She bent and placed\r\nthe shell in the white row, with its fellows. Thea took it up softly and\r\npressed it to her own ear. The sound in it startled her; it was like\r\nsomething calling one. So that was why Johnny ran away. There was\r\nsomething awe-inspiring about Mrs. Tellamantez and her shell.\r\n\r\nThea caught Dr. Archie's hand and squeezed it hard as she skipped along\r\nbeside him back toward Moonstone. She went home, and the doctor went\r\nback to his lamp and his book. He never left his office until after\r\nmidnight. If he did not play whist or pool in the evening, he read. It\r\nhad become a habit with him to lose himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThea's twelfth birthday had passed a few weeks before her memorable call\r\nupon Mrs. Tellamantez. There was a worthy man in Moonstone who was\r\nalready planning to marry Thea as soon as she should be old enough. His\r\nname was Ray Kennedy, his age was thirty, and he was conductor on a\r\nfreight train, his run being from Moonstone to Denver. Ray was a big\r\nfellow, with a square, open American face, a rock chin, and features\r\nthat one would never happen to remember. He was an aggressive idealist,\r\na freethinker, and, like most railroad men, deeply sentimental. Thea\r\nliked him for reasons that had to do with the adventurous life he had\r\nled in Mexico and the Southwest, rather than for anything very personal.\r\nShe liked him, too, because he was the only one of her friends who ever\r\ntook her to the sand hills. The sand hills were a constant\r\ntantalization; she loved them better than anything near Moonstone, and\r\nyet she could so seldom get to them. The first dunes were accessible\r\nenough; they were only a few miles beyond the Kohlers', and she could\r\nrun out there any day when she could do her practicing in the morning\r\nand get Thor off her hands for an afternoon. But the real hills--the\r\nTurquoise Hills, the Mexicans called them--were ten good miles away, and\r\none reached them by a heavy, sandy road. Dr. Archie sometimes took Thea\r\non his long drives, but as nobody lived in the sand hills, he never had\r\ncalls to make in that direction. Ray Kennedy was her only hope of\r\ngetting there.\r\n\r\nThis summer Thea had not been to the hills once, though Ray had planned\r\nseveral Sunday expeditions. Once Thor was sick, and once the organist in\r\nher father's church was away and Thea had to play the organ for the\r\nthree Sunday services. But on the first Sunday in September, Ray drove\r\nup to the Kronborgs' front gate at nine o'clock in the morning and the\r\nparty actually set off. Gunner and Axel went with Thea, and Ray had\r\nasked Spanish Johnny to come and to bring Mrs. Tellamantez and his\r\nmandolin. Ray was artlessly fond of music, especially of Mexican music.\r\nHe and Mrs. Tellamantez had got up the lunch between them, and they were\r\nto make coffee in the desert.\r\n\r\nWhen they left Mexican Town, Thea was on the front seat with Ray and\r\nJohnny, and Gunner and Axel sat behind with Mrs. Tellamantez. They\r\nobjected to this, of course, but there were some things about which Thea\r\nwould have her own way. \"As stubborn as a Finn,\" Mrs. Kronborg sometimes\r\nsaid of her, quoting an old Swedish saying. When they passed the\r\nKohlers', old Fritz and Wunsch were cutting grapes at the arbor. Thea\r\ngave them a businesslike nod. Wunsch came to the gate and looked after\r\nthem. He divined Ray Kennedy's hopes, and he distrusted every expedition\r\nthat led away from the piano. Unconsciously he made Thea pay for\r\nfrivolousness of this sort.\r\n\r\nAs Ray Kennedy's party followed the faint road across the sagebrush,\r\nthey heard behind them the sound of church bells, which gave them a\r\nsense of escape and boundless freedom. Every rabbit that shot across the\r\npath, every sage hen that flew up by the trail, was like a runaway\r\nthought, a message that one sent into the desert. As they went farther,\r\nthe illusion of the mirage became more instead of less convincing; a\r\nshallow silver lake that spread for many miles, a little misty in the\r\nsunlight. Here and there one saw reflected the image of a heifer, turned\r\nloose to live upon the sparse sand-grass. They were magnified to a\r\npreposterous height and looked like mammoths, prehistoric beasts\r\nstanding solitary in the waters that for many thousands of years\r\nactually washed over that desert;--the mirage itself may be the ghost\r\nof that long-vanished sea. Beyond the phantom lake lay the line of\r\nmany-colored hills; rich, sun-baked yellow, glowing turquoise, lavender,\r\npurple; all the open, pastel colors of the desert.\r\n\r\nAfter the first five miles the road grew heavier. The horses had to slow\r\ndown to a walk and the wheels sank deep into the sand, which now lay in\r\nlong ridges, like waves, where the last high wind had drifted it. Two\r\nhours brought the party to Pedro's Cup, named for a Mexican desperado\r\nwho had once held the sheriff at bay there. The Cup was a great\r\namphitheater, cut out in the hills, its floor smooth and packed hard,\r\ndotted with sagebrush and greasewood.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the Cup the yellow hills ran north and south, with\r\nwinding ravines between them, full of soft sand which drained down from\r\nthe crumbling banks. On the surface of this fluid sand, one could find\r\nbits of brilliant stone, crystals and agates and onyx, and petrified\r\nwood as red as blood. Dried toads and lizards were to be found there,\r\ntoo. Birds, decomposing more rapidly, left only feathered skeletons.\r\n\r\nAfter a little reconnoitering, Mrs. Tellamantez declared that it was\r\ntime for lunch, and Ray took his hatchet and began to cut greasewood,\r\nwhich burns fiercely in its green state. The little boys dragged the\r\nbushes to the spot that Mrs. Tellamantez had chosen for her fire.\r\nMexican women like to cook out of doors.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch Thea sent Gunner and Axel to hunt for agates. \"If you see a\r\nrattlesnake, run. Don't try to kill it,\" she enjoined.\r\n\r\nGunner hesitated. \"If Ray would let me take the hatchet, I could kill\r\none all right.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Tellamantez smiled and said something to Johnny in Spanish.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" her husband replied, translating, \"they say in Mexico, kill a\r\nsnake but never hurt his feelings. Down in the hot country, MUCHACHA,\"\r\nturning to Thea, \"people keep a pet snake in the house to kill rats and\r\nmice. They call him the house snake. They keep a little mat for him by\r\nthe fire, and at night he curl up there and sit with the family, just as\r\nfriendly!\"\r\n\r\nGunner sniffed with disgust. \"Well, I think that's a dirty Mexican way\r\nto keep house; so there!\"\r\n\r\nJohnny shrugged his shoulders. \"Perhaps,\" he muttered. A Mexican learns\r\nto dive below insults or soar above them, after he crosses the border.\r\n\r\nBy this time the south wall of the amphitheater cast a narrow shelf of\r\nshadow, and the party withdrew to this refuge. Ray and Johnny began to\r\ntalk about the Grand Canyon and Death Valley, two places much shrouded\r\nin mystery in those days, and Thea listened intently. Mrs. Tellamantez\r\ntook out her drawn-work and pinned it to her knee. Ray could talk well\r\nabout the large part of the continent over which he had been knocked\r\nabout, and Johnny was appreciative.\r\n\r\n\"You been all over, pretty near. Like a Spanish boy,\" he commented\r\nrespectfully.\r\n\r\nRay, who had taken off his coat, whetted his pocketknife thoughtfully on\r\nthe sole of his shoe. \"I began to browse around early. I had a mind to\r\nsee something of this world, and I ran away from home before I was\r\ntwelve. Rustled for myself ever since.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ran away?\" Johnny looked hopeful. \"What for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't make it go with my old man, and didn't take to farming. There\r\nwere plenty of boys at home. I wasn't missed.\"\r\n\r\nThea wriggled down in the hot sand and rested her chin on her arm. \"Tell\r\nJohnny about the melons, Ray, please do!\"\r\n\r\nRay's solid, sunburned cheeks grew a shade redder, and he looked\r\nreproachfully at Thea. \"You're stuck on that story, kid. You like to get\r\nthe laugh on me, don't you? That was the finishing split I had with my\r\nold man, John. He had a claim along the creek, not far from Denver, and\r\nraised a little garden stuff for market. One day he had a load of melons\r\nand he decided to take 'em to town and sell 'em along the street, and he\r\nmade me go along and drive for him. Denver wasn't the queen city it is\r\nnow, by any means, but it seemed a terrible big place to me; and when we\r\ngot there, if he didn't make me drive right up Capitol Hill! Pap got out\r\nand stopped at folkses houses to ask if they didn't want to buy any\r\nmelons, and I was to drive along slow. The farther I went the madder I\r\ngot, but I was trying to look unconscious, when the end-gate came loose\r\nand one of the melons fell out and squashed. Just then a swell girl, all\r\ndressed up, comes out of one of the big houses and calls out, 'Hello,\r\nboy, you're losing your melons!' Some dudes on the other side of the\r\nstreet took their hats off to her and began to laugh. I couldn't stand\r\nit any longer. I grabbed the whip and lit into that team, and they tore\r\nup the hill like jack-rabbits, them damned melons bouncing out the back\r\nevery jump, the old man cussin' an' yellin' behind and everybody\r\nlaughin'. I never looked behind, but the whole of Capitol Hill must have\r\nbeen a mess with them squashed melons. I didn't stop the team till I got\r\nout of sight of town. Then I pulled up an' left 'em with a rancher I was\r\nacquainted with, and I never went home to get the lickin' that was\r\nwaitin' for me. I expect it's waitin' for me yet.\"\r\n\r\nThea rolled over in the sand. \"Oh, I wish I could have seen those melons\r\nfly, Ray! I'll never see anything as funny as that. Now, tell Johnny\r\nabout your first job.\"\r\n\r\nRay had a collection of good stories. He was observant, truthful, and\r\nkindly--perhaps the chief requisites in a good story-teller.\r\nOccasionally he used newspaper phrases, conscientiously learned in his\r\nefforts at self-instruction, but when he talked naturally he was always\r\nworth listening to. Never having had any schooling to speak of, he had,\r\nalmost from the time he first ran away, tried to make good his loss. As\r\na sheep-herder he had worried an old grammar to tatters, and read\r\ninstructive books with the help of a pocket dictionary. By the light of\r\nmany camp-fires he had pondered upon Prescott's histories, and the works\r\nof Washington Irving, which he bought at a high price from a book-agent.\r\nMathematics and physics were easy for him, but general culture came\r\nhard, and he was determined to get it. Ray was a freethinker, and\r\ninconsistently believed himself damned for being one. When he was\r\nbraking, down on the Santa Fe, at the end of his run he used to climb\r\ninto the upper bunk of the caboose, while a noisy gang played poker\r\nabout the stove below him, and by the roof-lamp read Robert Ingersoll's\r\nspeeches and \"The Age of Reason.\"\r\n\r\nRay was a loyal-hearted fellow, and it had cost him a great deal to give\r\nup his God. He was one of the stepchildren of Fortune, and he had very\r\nlittle to show for all his hard work; the other fellow always got the\r\nbest of it. He had come in too late, or too early, on several schemes\r\nthat had made money. He brought with him from all his wanderings a good\r\ndeal of information (more or less correct in itself, but unrelated, and\r\ntherefore misleading), a high standard of personal honor, a sentimental\r\nveneration for all women, bad as well as good, and a bitter hatred of\r\nEnglishmen. Thea often thought that the nicest thing about Ray was his\r\nlove for Mexico and the Mexicans, who had been kind to him when he\r\ndrifted, a homeless boy, over the border. In Mexico, Ray was Senor\r\nKen-ay-dy, and when he answered to that name he was somehow a different\r\nfellow. He spoke Spanish fluently, and the sunny warmth of that tongue\r\nkept him from being quite as hard as his chin, or as narrow as his\r\npopular science.\r\n\r\nWhile Ray was smoking his cigar, he and Johnny fell to talking about the\r\ngreat fortunes that had been made in the Southwest, and about fellows\r\nthey knew who had \"struck it rich.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess you been in on some big deals down there?\" Johnny asked\r\ntrustfully.\r\n\r\nRay smiled and shook his head. \"I've been out on some, John. I've never\r\nbeen exactly in on any. So far, I've either held on too long or let go\r\ntoo soon. But mine's coming to me, all right.\" Ray looked reflective. He\r\nleaned back in the shadow and dug out a rest for his elbow in the sand.\r\n\"The narrowest escape I ever had, was in the Bridal Chamber. If I hadn't\r\nlet go there, it would have made me rich. That was a close call.\"\r\n\r\nJohnny looked delighted. \"You don' say! She was silver mine, I guess?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess she was! Down at Lake Valley. I put up a few hundred for the\r\nprospector, and he gave me a bunch of stock. Before we'd got anything\r\nout of it, my brother-in-law died of the fever in Cuba. My sister was\r\nbeside herself to get his body back to Colorado to bury him. Seemed\r\nfoolish to me, but she's the only sister I got. It's expensive for dead\r\nfolks to travel, and I had to sell my stock in the mine to raise the\r\nmoney to get Elmer on the move. Two months afterward, the boys struck\r\nthat big pocket in the rock, full of virgin silver. They named her the\r\nBridal Chamber. It wasn't ore, you remember. It was pure, soft metal you\r\ncould have melted right down into dollars. The boys cut it out with\r\nchisels. If old Elmer hadn't played that trick on me, I'd have been in\r\nfor about fifty thousand. That was a close call, Spanish.\"\r\n\r\n\"I recollec'. When the pocket gone, the town go bust.\"\r\n\r\n\"You bet. Higher'n a kite. There was no vein, just a pocket in the rock\r\nthat had sometime or another got filled up with molten silver. You'd\r\nthink there would be more somewhere about, but NADA. There's fools\r\ndigging holes in that mountain yet.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Ray had finished his cigar, Johnny took his mandolin and began\r\nKennedy's favorite, \"Ultimo Amor.\" It was now three o'clock in the\r\nafternoon, the hottest hour in the day. The narrow shelf of shadow had\r\nwidened until the floor of the amphitheater was marked off in two\r\nhalves, one glittering yellow, and one purple. The little boys had come\r\nback and were making a robbers' cave to enact the bold deeds of Pedro\r\nthe bandit. Johnny, stretched gracefully on the sand, passed from\r\n\"Ultimo Amor\" to \"Fluvia de Oro,\" and then to \"Noches de Algeria,\"\r\nplaying languidly.\r\n\r\nEvery one was busy with his own thoughts. Mrs. Tellamantez was thinking\r\nof the square in the little town in which she was born; of the white\r\nchurch steps, with people genuflecting as they passed, and the\r\nround-topped acacia trees, and the band playing in the plaza. Ray\r\nKennedy was thinking of the future, dreaming the large Western dream of\r\neasy money, of a fortune kicked up somewhere in the hills,--an oil well,\r\na gold mine, a ledge of copper. He always told himself, when he accepted\r\na cigar from a newly married railroad man, that he knew enough not to\r\nmarry until he had found his ideal, and could keep her like a queen. He\r\nbelieved that in the yellow head over there in the sand he had found his\r\nideal, and that by the time she was old enough to marry, he would be\r\nable to keep her like a queen. He would kick it up from somewhere, when\r\nhe got loose from the railroad.\r\n\r\nThea, stirred by tales of adventure, of the Grand Canyon and Death\r\nValley, was recalling a great adventure of her own. Early in the summer\r\nher father had been invited to conduct a reunion of old frontiersmen, up\r\nin Wyoming, near Laramie, and he took Thea along with him to play the\r\norgan and sing patriotic songs. There they stayed at the house of an old\r\nranchman who told them about a ridge up in the hills called Laramie\r\nPlain, where the wagon-trails of the Forty-niners and the Mormons were\r\nstill visible. The old man even volunteered to take Mr. Kronborg up into\r\nthe hills to see this place, though it was a very long drive to make in\r\none day. Thea had begged frantically to go along, and the old rancher,\r\nflattered by her rapt attention to his stories, had interceded for her.\r\n\r\nThey set out from Laramie before daylight, behind a strong team of\r\nmules. All the way there was much talk of the Forty-niners. The old\r\nrancher had been a teamster in a freight train that used to crawl back\r\nand forth across the plains between Omaha and Cherry Creek, as Denver\r\nwas then called, and he had met many a wagon train bound for California.\r\nHe told of Indians and buffalo, thirst and slaughter, wanderings in\r\nsnowstorms, and lonely graves in the desert.\r\n\r\nThe road they followed was a wild and beautiful one. It led up and up,\r\nby granite rocks and stunted pines, around deep ravines and echoing\r\ngorges. The top of the ridge, when they reached it, was a great flat\r\nplain, strewn with white boulders, with the wind howling over it. There\r\nwas not one trail, as Thea had expected; there were a score; deep\r\nfurrows, cut in the earth by heavy wagon wheels, and now grown over with\r\ndry, whitish grass. The furrows ran side by side; when one trail had\r\nbeen worn too deep, the next party had abandoned it and made a new trail\r\nto the right or left. They were, indeed, only old wagon ruts, running\r\neast and west, and grown over with grass. But as Thea ran about among\r\nthe white stones, her skirts blowing this way and that, the wind brought\r\nto her eyes tears that might have come anyway. The old rancher picked up\r\nan iron ox-shoe from one of the furrows and gave it to her for a\r\nkeepsake. To the west one could see range after range of blue mountains,\r\nand at last the snowy range, with its white, windy peaks, the clouds\r\ncaught here and there on their spurs. Again and again Thea had to hide\r\nher face from the cold for a moment. The wind never slept on this plain,\r\nthe old man said. Every little while eagles flew over.\r\n\r\nComing up from Laramie, the old man had told them that he was in\r\nBrownsville, Nebraska, when the first telegraph wires were put across\r\nthe Missouri River, and that the first message that ever crossed the\r\nriver was \"Westward the course of Empire takes its way.\" He had been in\r\nthe room when the instrument began to click, and all the men there had,\r\nwithout thinking what they were doing, taken off their hats, waiting\r\nbareheaded to hear the message translated. Thea remembered that message\r\nwhen she sighted down the wagon tracks toward the blue mountains. She\r\ntold herself she would never, never forget it. The spirit of human\r\ncourage seemed to live up there with the eagles. For long after, when\r\nshe was moved by a Fourth-of-July oration, or a band, or a circus\r\nparade, she was apt to remember that windy ridge.\r\n\r\nTo-day she went to sleep while she was thinking about it. When Ray\r\nwakened her, the horses were hitched to the wagon and Gunner and Axel\r\nwere begging for a place on the front seat. The air had cooled, the sun\r\nwas setting, and the desert was on fire. Thea contentedly took the back\r\nseat with Mrs. Tellamantez. As they drove homeward the stars began to\r\ncome out, pale yellow in a yellow sky, and Ray and Johnny began to sing\r\none of those railroad ditties that are usually born on the Southern\r\nPacific and run the length of the Santa Fe and the \"Q\" system before\r\nthey die to give place to a new one. This was a song about a Greaser\r\ndance, the refrain being something like this:--\r\n\r\n     \"Pedro, Pedro, swing high, swing low,\r\n     And it's allamand left again;\r\n     For there's boys that's bold and there's some that's cold,\r\n     But the gold boys come from Spain,\r\n     Oh, the gold boys come from Spain!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nWinter was long in coming that year. Throughout October the days were\r\nbathed in sunlight and the air was clear as crystal. The town kept its\r\ncheerful summer aspect, the desert glistened with light, the sand hills\r\nevery day went through magical changes of color. The scarlet sage\r\nbloomed late in the front yards, the cottonwood leaves were bright gold\r\nlong before they fell, and it was not until November that the green on\r\nthe tamarisks began to cloud and fade. There was a flurry of snow about\r\nThanksgiving, and then December came on warm and clear.\r\n\r\nThea had three music pupils now, little girls whose mothers declared\r\nthat Professor Wunsch was \"much too severe.\" They took their lessons on\r\nSaturday, and this, of course, cut down her time for play. She did not\r\nreally mind this because she was allowed to use the money--her pupils\r\npaid her twenty-five cents a lesson--to fit up a little room for herself\r\nupstairs in the half-story. It was the end room of the wing, and was not\r\nplastered, but was snugly lined with soft pine. The ceiling was so low\r\nthat a grown person could reach it with the palm of the hand, and it\r\nsloped down on either side. There was only one window, but it was a\r\ndouble one and went to the floor. In October, while the days were still\r\nwarm, Thea and Tillie papered the room, walls and ceiling in the same\r\npaper, small red and brown roses on a yellowish ground. Thea bought a\r\nbrown cotton carpet, and her big brother, Gus, put it down for her one\r\nSunday. She made white cheesecloth curtains and hung them on a tape. Her\r\nmother gave her an old walnut dresser with a broken mirror, and she had\r\nher own dumpy walnut single bed, and a blue washbowl and pitcher which\r\nshe had drawn at a church fair lottery. At the head of her bed she had a\r\ntall round wooden hat-crate, from the clothing store. This, standing on\r\nend and draped with cretonne, made a fairly steady table for her\r\nlantern. She was not allowed to take a lamp upstairs, so Ray Kennedy\r\ngave her a railroad lantern by which she could read at night.\r\n\r\nIn winter this loft room of Thea's was bitterly cold, but against her\r\nmother's advice--and Tillie's--she always left her window open a little\r\nway. Mrs. Kronborg declared that she \"had no patience with American\r\nphysiology,\" though the lessons about the injurious effects of alcohol\r\nand tobacco were well enough for the boys. Thea asked Dr. Archie about\r\nthe window, and he told her that a girl who sang must always have plenty\r\nof fresh air, or her voice would get husky, and that the cold would\r\nharden her throat. The important thing, he said, was to keep your feet\r\nwarm. On very cold nights Thea always put a brick in the oven after\r\nsupper, and when she went upstairs she wrapped it in an old flannel\r\npetticoat and put it in her bed. The boys, who would never heat bricks\r\nfor themselves, sometimes carried off Thea's, and thought it a good joke\r\nto get ahead of her.\r\n\r\nWhen Thea first plunged in between her red blankets, the cold sometimes\r\nkept her awake for a good while, and she comforted herself by\r\nremembering all she could of \"Polar Explorations,\" a fat, calf-bound\r\nvolume her father had bought from a book-agent, and by thinking about\r\nthe members of Greely's party: how they lay in their frozen\r\nsleeping-bags, each man hoarding the warmth of his own body and trying\r\nto make it last as long as possible against the on-coming cold that\r\nwould be everlasting. After half an hour or so, a warm wave crept over\r\nher body and round, sturdy legs; she glowed like a little stove with the\r\nwarmth of her own blood, and the heavy quilts and red blankets grew warm\r\nwherever they touched her, though her breath sometimes froze on the\r\ncoverlid. Before daylight, her internal fires went down a little, and\r\nshe often wakened to find herself drawn up into a tight ball, somewhat\r\nstiff in the legs. But that made it all the easier to get up.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of this room was the beginning of a new era in Thea's\r\nlife. It was one of the most important things that ever happened to her.\r\nHitherto, except in summer, when she could be out of doors, she had\r\nlived in constant turmoil; the family, the day school, the\r\nSunday-School. The clamor about her drowned the voice within herself. In\r\nthe end of the wing, separated from the other upstairs sleeping-rooms by\r\na long, cold, unfinished lumber room, her mind worked better. She\r\nthought things out more clearly. Pleasant plans and ideas occurred to\r\nher which had never come before. She had certain thoughts which were\r\nlike companions, ideas which were like older and wiser friends. She left\r\nthem there in the morning, when she finished dressing in the cold, and\r\nat night, when she came up with her lantern and shut the door after a\r\nbusy day, she found them awaiting her. There was no possible way of\r\nheating the room, but that was fortunate, for otherwise it would have\r\nbeen occupied by one of her older brothers.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when she moved up into the wing, Thea began to live a\r\ndouble life. During the day, when the hours were full of tasks, she was\r\none of the Kronborg children, but at night she was a different person.\r\nOn Friday and Saturday nights she always read for a long while after she\r\nwas in bed. She had no clock, and there was no one to nag her.\r\n\r\nRay Kennedy, on his way from the depot to his boardinghouse, often\r\nlooked up and saw Thea's light burning when the rest of the house was\r\ndark, and felt cheered as by a friendly greeting. He was a faithful\r\nsoul, and many disappointments had not changed his nature. He was still,\r\nat heart, the same boy who, when he was sixteen, had settled down to\r\nfreeze with his sheep in a Wyoming blizzard, and had been rescued only\r\nto play the losing game of fidelity to other charges.\r\n\r\nRay had no very clear idea of what might be going on in Thea's head, but\r\nhe knew that something was. He used to remark to Spanish Johnny, \"That\r\ngirl is developing something fine.\" Thea was patient with Ray, even in\r\nregard to the liberties he took with her name. Outside the family, every\r\none in Moonstone, except Wunsch and Dr. Archie, called her \"Thee-a,\" but\r\nthis seemed cold and distant to Ray, so he called her \"Thee.\" Once, in a\r\nmoment of exasperation, Thea asked him why he did this, and he explained\r\nthat he once had a chum, Theodore, whose name was always abbreviated\r\nthus, and that since he was killed down on the Santa Fe, it seemed\r\nnatural to call somebody \"Thee.\" Thea sighed and submitted. She was\r\nalways helpless before homely sentiment and usually changed the subject.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom for each of the different Sunday Schools in Moonstone\r\nto give a concert on Christmas Eve. But this year all the churches were\r\nto unite and give, as was announced from the pulpits, \"a semi-sacred\r\nconcert of picked talent\" at the opera house. The Moonstone Orchestra,\r\nunder the direction of Professor Wunsch, was to play, and the most\r\ntalented members of each Sunday School were to take part in the\r\nprogramme. Thea was put down by the committee \"for instrumental.\" This\r\nmade her indignant, for the vocal numbers were always more popular. Thea\r\nwent to the president of the committee and demanded hotly if her rival,\r\nLily Fisher, were going to sing. The president was a big, florid,\r\npowdered woman, a fierce W.C.T.U. worker, one of Thea's natural enemies.\r\nHer name was Johnson; her husband kept the livery stable, and she was\r\ncalled Mrs. Livery Johnson, to distinguish her from other families of\r\nthe same surname. Mrs. Johnson was a prominent Baptist, and Lily Fisher\r\nwas the Baptist prodigy. There was a not very Christian rivalry between\r\nthe Baptist Church and Mr. Kronborg's church.\r\n\r\nWhen Thea asked Mrs. Johnson whether her rival was to be allowed to\r\nsing, Mrs. Johnson, with an eagerness which told how she had waited for\r\nthis moment, replied that \"Lily was going to recite to be obliging, and\r\nto give other children a chance to sing.\" As she delivered this thrust,\r\nher eyes glittered more than the Ancient Mariner's, Thea thought. Mrs.\r\nJohnson disapproved of the way in which Thea was being brought up, of a\r\nchild whose chosen associates were Mexicans and sinners, and who was, as\r\nshe pointedly put it, \"bold with men.\" She so enjoyed an opportunity to\r\nrebuke Thea, that, tightly corseted as she was, she could scarcely\r\ncontrol her breathing, and her lace and her gold watch chain rose and\r\nfell \"with short, uneasy motion.\" Frowning, Thea turned away and walked\r\nslowly homeward. She suspected guile. Lily Fisher was the most stuck-up\r\ndoll in the world, and it was certainly not like her to recite to be\r\nobliging. Nobody who could sing ever recited, because the warmest\r\napplause always went to the singers.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the programme was printed in the Moonstone GLEAM, there it\r\nwas: \"Instrumental solo, Thea Kronborg. Recitation, Lily Fisher.\"\r\n\r\nBecause his orchestra was to play for the concert, Mr. Wunsch imagined\r\nthat he had been put in charge of the music, and he became arrogant. He\r\ninsisted that Thea should play a \"Ballade\" by Reinecke. When Thea\r\nconsulted her mother, Mrs. Kronborg agreed with her that the \"Ballade\"\r\nwould \"never take\" with a Moonstone audience. She advised Thea to play\r\n\"something with variations,\" or, at least, \"The Invitation to the\r\nDance.\"\r\n\r\n\"It makes no matter what they like,\" Wunsch replied to Thea's\r\nentreaties. \"It is time already that they learn something.\"\r\n\r\nThea's fighting powers had been impaired by an ulcerated tooth and\r\nconsequent loss of sleep, so she gave in. She finally had the molar\r\npulled, though it was a second tooth and should have been saved. The\r\ndentist was a clumsy, ignorant country boy, and Mr. Kronborg would not\r\nhear of Dr. Archie's taking Thea to a dentist in Denver, though Ray\r\nKennedy said he could get a pass for her. What with the pain of the\r\ntooth, and family discussions about it, with trying to make Christmas\r\npresents and to keep up her school work and practicing, and giving\r\nlessons on Saturdays, Thea was fairly worn out.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Eve she was nervous and excited. It was the first time she\r\nhad ever played in the opera house, and she had never before had to face\r\nso many people. Wunsch would not let her play with her notes, and she\r\nwas afraid of forgetting. Before the concert began, all the participants\r\nhad to assemble on the stage and sit there to be looked at. Thea wore\r\nher white summer dress and a blue sash, but Lily Fisher had a new pink\r\nsilk, trimmed with white swansdown.\r\n\r\nThe hall was packed. It seemed as if every one in Moonstone was there,\r\neven Mrs. Kohler, in her hood, and old Fritz. The seats were wooden\r\nkitchen chairs, numbered, and nailed to long planks which held them\r\ntogether in rows. As the floor was not raised, the chairs were all on\r\nthe same level. The more interested persons in the audience peered over\r\nthe heads of the people in front of them to get a good view of the\r\nstage. From the platform Thea picked out many friendly faces. There was\r\nDr. Archie, who never went to church entertainments; there was the\r\nfriendly jeweler who ordered her music for her,--he sold accordions and\r\nguitars as well as watches,--and the druggist who often lent her books,\r\nand her favorite teacher from the school. There was Ray Kennedy, with a\r\nparty of freshly barbered railroad men he had brought along with him.\r\nThere was Mrs. Kronborg with all the children, even Thor, who had been\r\nbrought out in a new white plush coat. At the back of the hall sat a\r\nlittle group of Mexicans, and among them Thea caught the gleam of\r\nSpanish Johnny's white teeth, and of Mrs. Tellamantez's lustrous,\r\nsmoothly coiled black hair.\r\n\r\nAfter the orchestra played \"Selections from Erminie,\" and the Baptist\r\npreacher made a long prayer, Tillie Kronborg came on with a highly\r\ncolored recitation, \"The Polish Boy.\" When it was over every one\r\nbreathed more freely. No committee had the courage to leave Tillie off a\r\nprogramme. She was accepted as a trying feature of every entertainment.\r\nThe Progressive Euchre Club was the only social organization in the town\r\nthat entirely escaped Tillie. After Tillie sat down, the Ladies'\r\nQuartette sang, \"Beloved, it is Night,\" and then it was Thea's turn.\r\n\r\nThe \"Ballade\" took ten minutes, which was five minutes too long. The\r\naudience grew restive and fell to whispering. Thea could hear Mrs.\r\nLivery Johnson's bracelets jangling as she fanned herself, and she could\r\nhear her father's nervous, ministerial cough. Thor behaved better than\r\nany one else. When Thea bowed and returned to her seat at the back of\r\nthe stage there was the usual applause, but it was vigorous only from\r\nthe back of the house where the Mexicans sat, and from Ray Kennedy's\r\nCLAQUEURS. Any one could see that a good-natured audience had been\r\nbored.\r\n\r\nBecause Mr. Kronborg's sister was on the programme, it had also been\r\nnecessary to ask the Baptist preacher's wife's cousin to sing. She was a\r\n\"deep alto\" from McCook, and she sang, \"Thy Sentinel Am I.\" After her\r\ncame Lily Fisher. Thea's rival was also a blonde, but her hair was much\r\nheavier than Thea's, and fell in long round curls over her shoulders.\r\nShe was the angel-child of the Baptists, and looked exactly like the\r\nbeautiful children on soap calendars. Her pink-and-white face, her set\r\nsmile of innocence, were surely born of a color-press. She had long,\r\ndrooping eyelashes, a little pursed-up mouth, and narrow, pointed teeth,\r\nlike a squirrel's.\r\n\r\nLily began:--\r\n\r\n\"ROCK OF AGES, CLEFT FOR ME, carelessly the maiden sang.\"\r\n\r\nThea drew a long breath. That was the game; it was a recitation and a\r\nsong in one. Lily trailed the hymn through half a dozen verses with\r\ngreat effect. The Baptist preacher had announced at the beginning of the\r\nconcert that \"owing to the length of the programme, there would be no\r\nencores.\" But the applause which followed Lily to her seat was such an\r\nunmistakable expression of enthusiasm that Thea had to admit Lily was\r\njustified in going back. She was attended this time by Mrs. Livery\r\nJohnson herself, crimson with triumph and gleaming-eyed, nervously\r\nrolling and unrolling a sheet of music. She took off her bracelets and\r\nplayed Lily's accompaniment. Lily had the effrontery to come out with,\r\n\"She sang the song of Home, Sweet Home, the song that touched my heart.\"\r\nBut this did not surprise Thea; as Ray said later in the evening, \"the\r\ncards had been stacked against her from the beginning.\" The next issue\r\nof the GLEAM correctly stated that \"unquestionably the honors of the\r\nevening must be accorded to Miss Lily Fisher.\" The Baptists had\r\neverything their own way.\r\n\r\nAfter the concert Ray Kennedy joined the Kronborgs' party and walked\r\nhome with them. Thea was grateful for his silent sympathy, even while it\r\nirritated her. She inwardly vowed that she would never take another\r\nlesson from old Wunsch. She wished that her father would not keep\r\ncheerfully singing, \"When Shepherds Watched,\" as he marched ahead,\r\ncarrying Thor. She felt that silence would become the Kronborgs for a\r\nwhile. As a family, they somehow seemed a little ridiculous, trooping\r\nalong in the starlight. There were so many of them, for one thing. Then\r\nTillie was so absurd. She was giggling and talking to Anna just as if\r\nshe had not made, as even Mrs. Kronborg admitted, an exhibition of\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nWhen they got home, Ray took a box from his overcoat pocket and slipped\r\nit into Thea's hand as he said goodnight. They all hurried in to the\r\nglowing stove in the parlor. The sleepy children were sent to bed. Mrs.\r\nKronborg and Anna stayed up to fill the stockings.\r\n\r\n\"I guess you're tired, Thea. You needn't stay up.\" Mrs. Kronborg's clear\r\nand seemingly indifferent eye usually measured Thea pretty accurately.\r\n\r\nThea hesitated. She glanced at the presents laid out on the dining-room\r\ntable, but they looked unattractive. Even the brown plush monkey she had\r\nbought for Thor with such enthusiasm seemed to have lost his wise and\r\nhumorous expression. She murmured, \"All right,\" to her mother, lit her\r\nlantern, and went upstairs.\r\n\r\nRay's box contained a hand-painted white satin fan, with pond lilies--an\r\nunfortunate reminder. Thea smiled grimly and tossed it into her upper\r\ndrawer. She was not to be consoled by toys. She undressed quickly and\r\nstood for some time in the cold, frowning in the broken looking glass at\r\nher flaxen pig-tails, at her white neck and arms. Her own broad,\r\nresolute face set its chin at her, her eyes flashed into her own\r\ndefiantly. Lily Fisher was pretty, and she was willing to be just as big\r\na fool as people wanted her to be. Very well; Thea Kronborg wasn't. She\r\nwould rather be hated than be stupid, any day. She popped into bed and\r\nread stubbornly at a queer paper book the drug-store man had given her\r\nbecause he couldn't sell it. She had trained herself to put her mind on\r\nwhat she was doing, otherwise she would have come to grief with her\r\ncomplicated daily schedule. She read, as intently as if she had not been\r\nflushed with anger, the strange \"Musical Memories\" of the Reverend H. R.\r\nHaweis. At last she blew out the lantern and went to sleep. She had many\r\ncurious dreams that night. In one of them Mrs. Tellamantez held her\r\nshell to Thea's ear, and she heard the roaring, as before, and distant\r\nvoices calling, \"Lily Fisher! Lily Fisher!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nMr. Kronborg considered Thea a remarkable child; but so were all his\r\nchildren remarkable. If one of the business men downtown remarked to him\r\nthat he \"had a mighty bright little girl, there,\" he admitted it, and at\r\nonce began to explain what a \"long head for business\" his son Gus had,\r\nor that Charley was \"a natural electrician,\" and had put in a telephone\r\nfrom the house to the preacher's study behind the church.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kronborg watched her daughter thoughtfully. She found her more\r\ninteresting than her other children, and she took her more seriously,\r\nwithout thinking much about why she did so. The other children had to be\r\nguided, directed, kept from conflicting with one another. Charley and\r\nGus were likely to want the same thing, and to quarrel about it. Anna\r\noften demanded unreasonable service from her older brothers; that they\r\nshould sit up until after midnight to bring her home from parties when\r\nshe did not like the youth who had offered himself as her escort; or\r\nthat they should drive twelve miles into the country, on a winter night,\r\nto take her to a ranch dance, after they had been working hard all day.\r\nGunner often got bored with his own clothes or stilts or sled, and\r\nwanted Axel's. But Thea, from the time she was a little thing, had her\r\nown routine. She kept out of every one's way, and was hard to manage\r\nonly when the other children interfered with her. Then there was trouble\r\nindeed: bursts of temper which used to alarm Mrs. Kronborg. \"You ought\r\nto know enough to let Thea alone. She lets you alone,\" she often said to\r\nthe other children.\r\n\r\nOne may have staunch friends in one's own family, but one seldom has\r\nadmirers. Thea, however, had one in the person of her addle-pated aunt,\r\nTillie Kronborg. In older countries, where dress and opinions and\r\nmanners are not so thoroughly standardized as in our own West, there is\r\na belief that people who are foolish about the more obvious things of\r\nlife are apt to have peculiar insight into what lies beyond the obvious.\r\nThe old woman who can never learn not to put the kerosene can on the\r\nstove, may yet be able to tell fortunes, to persuade a backward child to\r\ngrow, to cure warts, or to tell people what to do with a young girl who\r\nhas gone melancholy. Tillie's mind was a curious machine; when she was\r\nawake it went round like a wheel when the belt has slipped off, and when\r\nshe was asleep she dreamed follies. But she had intuitions. She knew,\r\nfor instance, that Thea was different from the other Kronborgs, worthy\r\nthough they all were. Her romantic imagination found possibilities in\r\nher niece. When she was sweeping or ironing, or turning the ice-cream\r\nfreezer at a furious rate, she often built up brilliant futures for\r\nThea, adapting freely the latest novel she had read.\r\n\r\nTillie made enemies for her niece among the church people because, at\r\nsewing societies and church suppers, she sometimes spoke vauntingly,\r\nwith a toss of her head, just as if Thea's \"wonderfulness\" were an\r\naccepted fact in Moonstone, like Mrs. Archie's stinginess, or Mrs.\r\nLivery Johnson's duplicity. People declared that, on this subject,\r\nTillie made them tired.\r\n\r\nTillie belonged to a dramatic club that once a year performed in the\r\nMoonstone Opera House such plays as \"Among the Breakers,\" and \"The\r\nVeteran of 1812.\" Tillie played character parts, the flirtatious old\r\nmaid or the spiteful INTRIGANTE. She used to study her parts up in the\r\nattic at home. While she was committing the lines, she got Gunner or\r\nAnna to hold the book for her, but when she began \"to bring out the\r\nexpression,\" as she said, she used, very timorously, to ask Thea to hold\r\nthe book. Thea was usually--not always--agreeable about it. Her mother\r\nhad told her that, since she had some influence with Tillie, it would be\r\na good thing for them all if she could tone her down a shade and \"keep\r\nher from taking on any worse than need be.\" Thea would sit on the foot\r\nof Tillie's bed, her feet tucked under her, and stare at the silly text.\r\n\"I wouldn't make so much fuss, there, Tillie,\" she would remark\r\noccasionally; \"I don't see the point in it\"; or, \"What do you pitch your\r\nvoice so high for? It don't carry half as well.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how it comes Thea is so patient with Tillie,\" Mrs. Kronborg\r\nmore than once remarked to her husband. \"She ain't patient with most\r\npeople, but it seems like she's got a peculiar patience for Tillie.\"\r\n\r\nTillie always coaxed Thea to go \"behind the scenes\" with her when the\r\nclub presented a play, and help her with her make-up. Thea hated it, but\r\nshe always went. She felt as if she had to do it. There was something in\r\nTillie's adoration of her that compelled her. There was no family\r\nimpropriety that Thea was so much ashamed of as Tillie's \"acting\" and\r\nyet she was always being dragged in to assist her. Tillie simply had\r\nher, there. She didn't know why, but it was so. There was a string in\r\nher somewhere that Tillie could pull; a sense of obligation to Tillie's\r\nmisguided aspirations. The saloon-keepers had some such feeling of\r\nresponsibility toward Spanish Johnny.\r\n\r\nThe dramatic club was the pride of Tillie's heart, and her enthusiasm\r\nwas the principal factor in keeping it together. Sick or well, Tillie\r\nalways attended rehearsals, and was always urging the young people, who\r\ntook rehearsals lightly, to \"stop fooling and begin now.\" The young\r\nmen--bank clerks, grocery clerks, insurance agents--played tricks,\r\nlaughed at Tillie, and \"put it up on each other\" about seeing her home;\r\nbut they often went to tiresome rehearsals just to oblige her. They were\r\ngood-natured young fellows. Their trainer and stage-manager was young\r\nUpping, the jeweler who ordered Thea's music for her.\r\n\r\nThough barely thirty, he had followed half a dozen professions, and had\r\nonce been a violinist in the orchestra of the Andrews Opera Company,\r\nthen well known in little towns throughout Colorado and Nebraska.\r\n\r\nBy one amazing indiscretion Tillie very nearly lost her hold upon the\r\nMoonstone Drama Club. The club had decided to put on \"The Drummer Boy of\r\nShiloh,\" a very ambitious undertaking because of the many supers needed\r\nand the scenic difficulties of the act which took place in Andersonville\r\nPrison. The members of the club consulted together in Tillie's absence\r\nas to who should play the part of the drummer boy. It must be taken by a\r\nvery young person, and village boys of that age are self-conscious and\r\nare not apt at memorizing. The part was a long one, and clearly it must\r\nbe given to a girl. Some members of the club suggested Thea Kronborg,\r\nothers advocated Lily Fisher. Lily's partisans urged that she was much\r\nprettier than Thea, and had a much \"sweeter disposition.\" Nobody denied\r\nthese facts. But there was nothing in the least boyish about Lily, and\r\nshe sang all songs and played all parts alike. Lily's simper was\r\npopular, but it seemed not quite the right thing for the heroic drummer\r\nboy.\r\n\r\nUpping, the trainer, talked to one and another: \"Lily's all right for\r\ngirl parts,\" he insisted, \"but you've got to get a girl with some ginger\r\nin her for this. Thea's got the voice, too. When she sings, 'Just Before\r\nthe Battle, Mother,' she'll bring down the house.\"\r\n\r\nWhen all the members of the club had been privately consulted, they\r\nannounced their decision to Tillie at the first regular meeting that was\r\ncalled to cast the parts. They expected Tillie to be overcome with joy,\r\nbut, on the contrary, she seemed embarrassed. \"I'm afraid Thea hasn't\r\ngot time for that,\" she said jerkily. \"She is always so busy with her\r\nmusic. Guess you'll have to get somebody else.\"\r\n\r\nThe club lifted its eyebrows. Several of Lily Fisher's friends coughed.\r\nMr. Upping flushed. The stout woman who always played the injured wife\r\ncalled Tillie's attention to the fact that this would be a fine\r\nopportunity for her niece to show what she could do. Her tone was\r\ncondescending.\r\n\r\nTillie threw up her head and laughed; there was something sharp and wild\r\nabout Tillie's laugh--when it was not a giggle. \"Oh, I guess Thea hasn't\r\ngot time to do any showing off. Her time to show off ain't come yet. I\r\nexpect she'll make us all sit up when it does. No use asking her to take\r\nthe part. She'd turn her nose up at it. I guess they'd be glad to get\r\nher in the Denver Dramatics, if they could.\"\r\n\r\nThe company broke up into groups and expressed their amazement. Of\r\ncourse all Swedes were conceited, but they would never have believed\r\nthat all the conceit of all the Swedes put together would reach such a\r\npitch as this. They confided to each other that Tillie was \"just a\r\nlittle off, on the subject of her niece,\" and agreed that it would be as\r\nwell not to excite her further. Tillie got a cold reception at\r\nrehearsals for a long while afterward, and Thea had a crop of new\r\nenemies without even knowing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nWunsch and old Fritz and Spanish Johnny celebrated Christmas together,\r\nso riotously that Wunsch was unable to give Thea her lesson the next\r\nday. In the middle of the vacation week Thea went to the Kohlers'\r\nthrough a soft, beautiful snowstorm. The air was a tender blue-gray,\r\nlike the color on the doves that flew in and out of the white dove-house\r\non the post in the Kohlers' garden. The sand hills looked dim and\r\nsleepy. The tamarisk hedge was full of snow, like a foam of blossoms\r\ndrifted over it. When Thea opened the gate, old Mrs. Kohler was just\r\ncoming in from the chicken yard, with five fresh eggs in her apron and a\r\npair of old top-boots on her feet. She called Thea to come and look at a\r\nbantam egg, which she held up proudly. Her bantam hens were remiss in\r\nzeal, and she was always delighted when they accomplished anything. She\r\ntook Thea into the sitting-room, very warm and smelling of food, and\r\nbrought her a plateful of little Christmas cakes, made according to old\r\nand hallowed formulae, and put them before her while she warmed her\r\nfeet. Then she went to the door of the kitchen stairs and called: \"Herr\r\nWunsch, Herr Wunsch!\"\r\n\r\nWunsch came down wearing an old wadded jacket, with a velvet collar. The\r\nbrown silk was so worn that the wadding stuck out almost everywhere. He\r\navoided Thea's eyes when he came in, nodded without speaking, and\r\npointed directly to the piano stool. He was not so insistent upon the\r\nscales as usual, and throughout the little sonata of Mozart's she was\r\nstudying, he remained languid and absent-minded. His eyes looked very\r\nheavy, and he kept wiping them with one of the new silk handkerchiefs\r\nMrs. Kohler had given him for Christmas. When the lesson was over he did\r\nnot seem inclined to talk. Thea, loitering on the stool, reached for a\r\ntattered book she had taken off the music-rest when she sat down. It was\r\na very old Leipsic edition of the piano score of Gluck's \"Orpheus.\" She\r\nturned over the pages curiously.\r\n\r\n\"Is it nice?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"It is the most beautiful opera ever made,\" Wunsch declared solemnly.\r\n\"You know the story, eh? How, when she die, Orpheus went down below for\r\nhis wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I know. I didn't know there was an opera about it, though. Do\r\npeople sing this now?\"\r\n\r\n\"ABER JA! What else? You like to try? See.\" He drew her from the stool\r\nand sat down at the piano. Turning over the leaves to the third act, he\r\nhanded the score to Thea. \"Listen, I play it through and you get the\r\nRHYTHMUS. EINS, ZWEI, DREI, VIER.\" He played through Orpheus' lament,\r\nthen pushed back his cuffs with awakening interest and nodded at Thea.\r\n\"Now, VOM BLATT, MIT MIR.\"\r\n\r\n\"ACH, ICH HABE SIE VERLOREN, ALL' MEIN GLUCK IST NUN DAHIN.\"\r\n\r\nWunsch sang the aria with much feeling. It was evidently one that was\r\nvery dear to him.\r\n\r\n\"NOCH EINMAL, alone, yourself.\" He played the introductory measures,\r\nthen nodded at her vehemently, and she began:--\r\n\r\n\"ACH, ICH HABE SIE VERLOREN.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she finished, Wunsch nodded again. \"SCHON,\" he muttered as he\r\nfinished the accompaniment softly. He dropped his hands on his knees and\r\nlooked up at Thea. \"That is very fine, eh? There is no such beautiful\r\nmelody in the world. You can take the book for one week and learn\r\nsomething, to pass the time. It is good to know--always. EURIDICE,\r\nEU--RI--DI--CE, WEH DASS ICH AUF ERDEN BIN!\" he sang softly, playing the\r\nmelody with his right hand.\r\n\r\nThea, who was turning over the pages of the third act, stopped and\r\nscowled at a passage. The old German's blurred eyes watched her\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\n\"For what do you look so, IMMER?\" puckering up his own face. \"You see\r\nsomething a little difficult, may-be, and you make such a face like it\r\nwas an enemy.\"\r\n\r\nThea laughed, disconcerted. \"Well, difficult things are enemies, aren't\r\nthey? When you have to get them?\"\r\n\r\nWunsch lowered his head and threw it up as if he were butting something.\r\n\"Not at all! By no means.\" He took the book from her and looked at it.\r\n\"Yes, that is not so easy, there. This is an old book. They do not print\r\nit so now any more, I think. They leave it out, may-be. Only one woman\r\ncould sing that good.\"\r\n\r\nThea looked at him in perplexity.\r\n\r\nWunsch went on. \"It is written for alto, you see. A woman sings the\r\npart, and there was only one to sing that good in there. You understand?\r\nOnly one!\" He glanced at her quickly and lifted his red forefinger\r\nupright before her eyes.\r\n\r\nThea looked at the finger as if she were hypnotized. \"Only one?\" she\r\nasked breathlessly; her hands, hanging at her sides, were opening and\r\nshutting rapidly.\r\n\r\nWunsch nodded and still held up that compelling finger. When he dropped\r\nhis hands, there was a look of satisfaction in his face.\r\n\r\n\"Was she very great?\"\r\n\r\nWunsch nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Was she beautiful?\"\r\n\r\n\"ABER GAR NICHT! Not at all. She was ugly; big mouth, big teeth, no\r\nfigure, nothing at all,\" indicating a luxuriant bosom by sweeping his\r\nhands over his chest. \"A pole, a post! But for the voice--ACH! She have\r\nsomething in there, behind the eyes,\" tapping his temples.\r\n\r\nThea followed all his gesticulations intently. \"Was she German?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, SPANISCH.\" He looked down and frowned for a moment. \"ACH, I tell\r\nyou, she look like the Frau Tellamantez, some-thing. Long face, long\r\nchin, and ugly al-so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she die a long while ago?\"\r\n\r\n\"Die? I think not. I never hear, anyhow. I guess she is alive somewhere\r\nin the world; Paris, may-be. But old, of course. I hear her when I was a\r\nyouth. She is too old to sing now any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was she the greatest singer you ever heard?\"\r\n\r\nWunsch nodded gravely. \"Quite so. She was the most--\" he hunted for an\r\nEnglish word, lifted his hand over his head and snapped his fingers\r\nnoiselessly in the air, enunciating fiercely, \"KUNST-LER-ISCH!\" The word\r\nseemed to glitter in his uplifted hand, his voice was so full of\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\nWunsch rose from the stool and began to button his wadded jacket,\r\npreparing to return to his half-heated room in the loft. Thea\r\nregretfully put on her cloak and hood and set out for home.\r\n\r\nWhen Wunsch looked for his score late that afternoon, he found that Thea\r\nhad not forgotten to take it with her. He smiled his loose, sarcastic\r\nsmile, and thoughtfully rubbed his stubbly chin with his red fingers.\r\nWhen Fritz came home in the early blue twilight the snow was flying\r\nfaster, Mrs. Kohler was cooking HASENPFEFFER in the kitchen, and the\r\nprofessor was seated at the piano, playing the Gluck, which he knew by\r\nheart. Old Fritz took off his shoes quietly behind the stove and lay\r\ndown on the lounge before his masterpiece, where the firelight was\r\nplaying over the walls of Moscow. He listened, while the room grew\r\ndarker and the windows duller. Wunsch always came back to the same\r\nthing:--\r\n\r\n\"ACH, ICH HABE SIE VERLOREN,...EURIDICE, EURIDICE!\"\r\n\r\nFrom time to time Fritz sighed softly. He, too, had lost a Euridice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nOne Saturday, late in June, Thea arrived early for her lesson. As she\r\nperched herself upon the piano stool,--a wobbly, old-fashioned thing\r\nthat worked on a creaky screw,--she gave Wunsch a side glance, smiling.\r\n\"You must not be cross to me to-day. This is my birthday.\"\r\n\r\n\"So?\" he pointed to the keyboard.\r\n\r\nAfter the lesson they went out to join Mrs. Kohler, who had asked Thea\r\nto come early, so that she could stay and smell the linden bloom. It was\r\none of those still days of intense light, when every particle of mica in\r\nthe soil flashed like a little mirror, and the glare from the plain\r\nbelow seemed more intense than the rays from above. The sand ridges ran\r\nglittering gold out to where the mirage licked them up, shining and\r\nsteaming like a lake in the tropics. The sky looked like blue lava,\r\nforever incapable of clouds,--a turquoise bowl that was the lid of the\r\ndesert. And yet within Mrs. Kohler's green patch the water dripped, the\r\nbeds had all been hosed, and the air was fresh with rapidly evaporating\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\nThe two symmetrical linden trees were the proudest things in the garden.\r\nTheir sweetness embalmed all the air. At every turn of the\r\npaths,--whether one went to see the hollyhocks or the bleeding heart, or\r\nto look at the purple morning-glories that ran over the\r\nbean-poles,--wherever one went, the sweetness of the lindens struck one\r\nafresh and one always came back to them. Under the round leaves, where\r\nthe waxen yellow blossoms hung, bevies of wild bees were buzzing. The\r\ntamarisks were still pink, and the flower-beds were doing their best in\r\nhonor of the linden festival. The white dove-house was shining with a\r\nfresh coat of paint, and the pigeons were crooning contentedly, flying\r\ndown often to drink at the drip from the water tank. Mrs. Kohler, who\r\nwas transplanting pansies, came up with her trowel and told Thea it was\r\nlucky to have your birthday when the lindens were in bloom, and that she\r\nmust go and look at the sweet peas. Wunsch accompanied her, and as they\r\nwalked between the flower-beds he took Thea's hand.\r\n\r\n\"ES FLUSTERN UND SPRECHEN DIE BLUMEN,\"--he muttered. \"You know that von\r\nHeine? IM LEUCHTENDEN SOMMERMORGEN?\" He looked down at Thea and softly\r\npressed her hand.\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't know it. What does FLUSTERN mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"FLUSTERN?--to whisper. You must begin now to know such things. That is\r\nnecessary. How many birthdays?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thirteen. I'm in my 'teens now. But how can I know words like that? I\r\nonly know what you say at my lessons. They don't teach German at school.\r\nHow can I learn?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is always possible to learn when one likes,\" said Wunsch. His words\r\nwere peremptory, as usual, but his tone was mild, even confidential.\r\n\"There is always a way. And if some day you are going to sing, it is\r\nnecessary to know well the German language.\"\r\n\r\nThea stooped over to pick a leaf of rosemary. How did Wunsch know that,\r\nwhen the very roses on her wall-paper had never heard it? \"But am I\r\ngoing to?\" she asked, still stooping.\r\n\r\n\"That is for you to say,\" returned Wunsch coldly. \"You would better\r\nmarry some JACOB here and keep the house for him, may-be? That is as one\r\ndesires.\"\r\n\r\nThea flashed up at him a clear, laughing look. \"No, I don't want to do\r\nthat. You know,\" she brushed his coat sleeve quickly with her yellow\r\nhead. \"Only how can I learn anything here? It's so far from Denver.\"\r\n\r\nWunsch's loose lower lip curled in amusement. Then, as if he suddenly\r\nremembered something, he spoke seriously. \"Nothing is far and nothing is\r\nnear, if one desires. The world is little, people are little, human life\r\nis little. There is only one big thing--desire. And before it, when it\r\nis big, all is little. It brought Columbus across the sea in a little\r\nboat, UND SO WEITER.\" Wunsch made a grimace, took his pupil's hand and\r\ndrew her toward the grape arbor. \"Hereafter I will more speak to you in\r\nGerman. Now, sit down and I will teach you for your birthday that little\r\nsong. Ask me the words you do not know already. Now: IM LEUCHTENDEN\r\nSOMMERMORGEN.\"\r\n\r\nThea memorized quickly because she had the power of listening intently.\r\nIn a few moments she could repeat the eight lines for him. Wunsch nodded\r\nencouragingly and they went out of the arbor into the sunlight again. As\r\nthey went up and down the gravel paths between the flowerbeds, the white\r\nand yellow butterflies kept darting before them, and the pigeons were\r\nwashing their pink feet at the drip and crooning in their husky bass.\r\nOver and over again Wunsch made her say the lines to him. \"You see it is\r\nnothing. If you learn a great many of the LIEDER, you will know the\r\nGerman language already. WEITER, NUN.\" He would incline his head gravely\r\nand listen.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"IM LEUCHTENDEN SOMMERMORGEN\r\n     GEH' ICH IM GARTEN HERUM;\r\n     ES FLUSTERN UND SPRECHEN DIE BLUMEN,\r\n     ICH ABER, ICH WANDTE STUMM.\r\n\r\n     \"ES FLUSTERN UND SPRECHEN DIE BLUMEN\r\n     UND SCHAU'N MITLEIDIG MICH AN:\r\n     'SEI UNSERER SCHWESTER NICHT BOSE,\r\n     DU TRAURIGER, BLASSER MANN!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     (In the soft-shining summer morning\r\n     I wandered the garden within.\r\n     The flowers they whispered and murmured,\r\n     But I, I wandered dumb.\r\n\r\n     The flowers they whisper and murmur,\r\n     And me with compassion they scan:\r\n     \"Oh, be not harsh to our sister,\r\n     Thou sorrowful, death-pale man!\")\r\n\r\n\r\nWunsch had noticed before that when his pupil read anything in verse the\r\ncharacter of her voice changed altogether; it was no longer the voice\r\nwhich spoke the speech of Moonstone. It was a soft, rich contralto, and\r\nshe read quietly; the feeling was in the voice itself, not indicated by\r\nemphasis or change of pitch. She repeated the little verses musically,\r\nlike a song, and the entreaty of the flowers was even softer than the\r\nrest, as the shy speech of flowers might be, and she ended with the\r\nvoice suspended, almost with a rising inflection. It was a nature-voice,\r\nWunsch told himself, breathed from the creature and apart from language,\r\nlike the sound of the wind in the trees, or the murmur of water.\r\n\r\n\"What is it the flowers mean when they ask him not to be harsh to their\r\nsister, eh?\" he asked, looking down at her curiously and wrinkling his\r\ndull red forehead.\r\n\r\nThea glanced at him in surprise. \"I suppose he thinks they are asking\r\nhim not to be harsh to his sweetheart--or some girl they remind him of.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why TRAURIGER, BLASSER MANN?\"\r\n\r\nThey had come back to the grape arbor, and Thea picked out a sunny place\r\non the bench, where a tortoise-shell cat was stretched at full length.\r\nShe sat down, bending over the cat and teasing his whiskers. \"Because he\r\nhad been awake all night, thinking about her, wasn't it? Maybe that was\r\nwhy he was up so early.\"\r\n\r\nWunsch shrugged his shoulders. \"If he think about her all night already,\r\nwhy do you say the flowers remind him?\"\r\n\r\nThea looked up at him in perplexity. A flash of comprehension lit her\r\nface and she smiled eagerly. \"Oh, I didn't mean 'remind' in that way! I\r\ndidn't mean they brought her to his mind! I meant it was only when he\r\ncame out in the morning, that she seemed to him like that,--like one of\r\nthe flowers.\"\r\n\r\n\"And before he came out, how did she seem?\"\r\n\r\nThis time it was Thea who shrugged her shoulders. The warm smile left\r\nher face. She lifted her eyebrows in annoyance and looked off at the\r\nsand hills.\r\n\r\nWunsch persisted. \"Why you not answer me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it would be silly. You are just trying to make me say things.\r\nIt spoils things to ask questions.\"\r\n\r\nWunsch bowed mockingly; his smile was disagreeable. Suddenly his face\r\ngrew grave, grew fierce, indeed. He pulled himself up from his clumsy\r\nstoop and folded his arms. \"But it is necessary to know if you know some\r\nthings. Some things cannot be taught. If you not know in the beginning,\r\nyou not know in the end. For a singer there must be something in the\r\ninside from the beginning. I shall not be long in this place, may-be,\r\nand I like to know. Yes,\"--he ground his heel in the gravel,--\"yes, when\r\nyou are barely six, you must know that already. That is the beginning of\r\nall things; DER GEIST, DIE PHANTASIE. It must be in the baby, when it\r\nmakes its first cry, like DER RHYTHMUS, or it is not to be. You have\r\nsome voice already, and if in the beginning, when you are with\r\nthings-to-play, you know that what you will not tell me, then you can\r\nlearn to sing, may-be.\"\r\n\r\nWunsch began to pace the arbor, rubbing his hands together. The dark\r\nflush of his face had spread up under the iron-gray bristles on his\r\nhead. He was talking to himself, not to Thea. Insidious power of the\r\nlinden bloom! \"Oh, much you can learn! ABER NICHT DIE AMERICANISCHEN\r\nFRAULEIN. They have nothing inside them,\" striking his chest with both\r\nfists. \"They are like the ones in the MARCHEN, a grinning face and\r\nhollow in the insides. Something they can learn, oh, yes, may-be! But\r\nthe secret--what make the rose to red, the sky to blue, the man to\r\nlove--IN DER BRUST, IN DER BRUST it is, UND OHNE DIESES GIEBT ES KEINE\r\nKUNST, GIEBT ES KEINE KUNST!\" He threw up his square hand and shook it,\r\nall the fingers apart and wagging. Purple and breathless he went out of\r\nthe arbor and into the house, without saying good-bye. These outbursts\r\nfrightened Wunsch. They were always harbingers of ill.\r\n\r\nThea got her music-book and stole quietly out of the garden. She did not\r\ngo home, but wandered off into the sand dunes, where the prickly pear\r\nwas in blossom and the green lizards were racing each other in the\r\nglittering light. She was shaken by a passionate excitement. She did not\r\naltogether understand what Wunsch was talking about; and yet, in a way\r\nshe knew. She knew, of course, that there was something about her that\r\nwas different. But it was more like a friendly spirit than like anything\r\nthat was a part of herself. She thought everything to it, and it\r\nanswered her; happiness consisted of that backward and forward movement\r\nof herself. The something came and went, she never knew how. Sometimes\r\nshe hunted for it and could not find it; again, she lifted her eyes from\r\na book, or stepped out of doors, or wakened in the morning, and it was\r\nthere,--under her cheek, it usually seemed to be, or over her breast,--a\r\nkind of warm sureness. And when it was there, everything was more\r\ninteresting and beautiful, even people. When this companion was with\r\nher, she could get the most wonderful things out of Spanish Johnny, or\r\nWunsch, or Dr. Archie.\r\n\r\nOn her thirteenth birthday she wandered for a long while about the sand\r\nridges, picking up crystals and looking into the yellow prickly-pear\r\nblossoms with their thousand stamens. She looked at the sand hills until\r\nshe wished she WERE a sand hill. And yet she knew that she was going to\r\nleave them all behind some day. They would be changing all day long,\r\nyellow and purple and lavender, and she would not be there. From that\r\nday on, she felt there was a secret between her and Wunsch. Together\r\nthey had lifted a lid, pulled out a drawer, and looked at something.\r\nThey hid it away and never spoke of what they had seen; but neither of\r\nthem forgot it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nOne July night, when the moon was full, Dr. Archie was coming up from\r\nthe depot, restless and discontented, wishing there were something to\r\ndo. He carried his straw hat in his hand, and kept brushing his hair\r\nback from his forehead with a purposeless, unsatisfied gesture. After he\r\npassed Uncle Billy Beemer's cottonwood grove, the sidewalk ran out of\r\nthe shadow into the white moonlight and crossed the sand gully on high\r\nposts, like a bridge. As the doctor approached this trestle, he saw a\r\nwhite figure, and recognized Thea Kronborg. He quickened his pace and\r\nshe came to meet him.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing out so late, my girl?\" he asked as he took her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know. What do people go to bed so early for? I'd like to\r\nrun along before the houses and screech at them. Isn't it glorious out\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\nThe young doctor gave a melancholy laugh and pressed her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Think of it,\" Thea snorted impatiently. \"Nobody up but us and the\r\nrabbits! I've started up half a dozen of 'em. Look at that little one\r\ndown there now,\"--she stooped and pointed. In the gully below them there\r\nwas, indeed, a little rabbit with a white spot of a tail, crouching down\r\non the sand, quite motionless. It seemed to be lapping up the moonlight\r\nlike cream. On the other side of the walk, down in the ditch, there was\r\na patch of tall, rank sunflowers, their shaggy leaves white with dust.\r\nThe moon stood over the cottonwood grove. There was no wind, and no\r\nsound but the wheezing of an engine down on the tracks.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we may as well watch the rabbits.\" Dr. Archie sat down on the\r\nsidewalk and let his feet hang over the edge. He pulled out a smooth\r\nlinen handkerchief that smelled of German cologne water. \"Well, how goes\r\nit? Working hard? You must know about all Wunsch can teach you by this\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nThea shook her head. \"Oh, no, I don't, Dr. Archie. He's hard to get at,\r\nbut he's been a real musician in his time. Mother says she believes he's\r\nforgotten more than the music-teachers down in Denver ever knew.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid he won't be around here much longer,\" said Dr. Archie. \"He's\r\nbeen making a tank of himself lately. He'll be pulling his freight one\r\nof these days. That's the way they do, you know. I'll be sorry on your\r\naccount.\" He paused and ran his fresh handkerchief over his face. \"What\r\nthe deuce are we all here for anyway, Thea?\" he said abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"On earth, you mean?\" Thea asked in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"Well, primarily, yes. But secondarily, why are we in Moonstone? It\r\nisn't as if we'd been born here. You were, but Wunsch wasn't, and I\r\nwasn't. I suppose I'm here because I married as soon as I got out of\r\nmedical school and had to get a practice quick. If you hurry things, you\r\nalways get left in the end. I don't learn anything here, and as for the\r\npeople--In my own town in Michigan, now, there were people who liked me\r\non my father's account, who had even known my grandfather. That meant\r\nsomething. But here it's all like the sand: blows north one day and\r\nsouth the next. We're all a lot of gamblers without much nerve, playing\r\nfor small stakes. The railroad is the one real fact in this country.\r\nThat has to be; the world has to be got back and forth. But the rest of\r\nus are here just because it's the end of a run and the engine has to\r\nhave a drink. Some day I'll get up and find my hair turning gray, and\r\nI'll have nothing to show for it.\"\r\n\r\nThea slid closer to him and caught his arm. \"No, no. I won't let you get\r\ngray. You've got to stay young for me. I'm getting young now, too.\"\r\n\r\nArchie laughed. \"Getting?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. People aren't young when they're children. Look at Thor, now; he's\r\njust a little old man. But Gus has a sweetheart, and he's young!\"\r\n\r\n\"Something in that!\" Dr. Archie patted her head, and then felt the shape\r\nof her skull gently, with the tips of his fingers. \"When you were\r\nlittle, Thea, I used always to be curious about the shape of your head.\r\nYou seemed to have more inside it than most youngsters. I haven't\r\nexamined it for a long time. Seems to be the usual shape, but uncommonly\r\nhard, some how. What are you going to do with yourself, anyway?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Honest, now?\" He lifted her chin and looked into her eyes.\r\n\r\nThea laughed and edged away from him.\r\n\r\n\"You've got something up your sleeve, haven't you? Anything you like;\r\nonly don't marry and settle down here without giving yourself a chance,\r\nwill you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much. See, there's another rabbit!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right about the rabbits, but I don't want you to get tied\r\nup. Remember that.\"\r\n\r\nThea nodded. \"Be nice to Wunsch, then. I don't know what I'd do if he\r\nwent away.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got older friends than Wunsch here, Thea.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know.\" Thea spoke seriously and looked up at the moon, propping her\r\nchin on her hand. \"But Wunsch is the only one that can teach me what I\r\nwant to know. I've got to learn to do something well, and that's the\r\nthing I can do best.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to be a music-teacher?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe, but I want to be a good one. I'd like to go to Germany to study,\r\nsome day. Wunsch says that's the best place,--the only place you can\r\nreally learn.\" Thea hesitated and then went on nervously, \"I've got a\r\nbook that says so, too. It's called 'My Musical Memories.' It made me\r\nwant to go to Germany even before Wunsch said anything. Of course it's a\r\nsecret. You're the first one I've told.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie smiled indulgently. \"That's a long way off. Is that what\r\nyou've got in your hard noddle?\" He put his hand on her hair, but this\r\ntime she shook him off.\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't think much about it. But you talk about going, and a body\r\nhas to have something to go TO!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so.\" Dr. Archie sighed. \"You're lucky if you have. Poor Wunsch,\r\nnow, he hasn't. What do such fellows come out here for? He's been asking\r\nme about my mining stock, and about mining towns. What would he do in a\r\nmining town? He wouldn't know a piece of ore if he saw one. He's got\r\nnothing to sell that a mining town wants to buy. Why don't those old\r\nfellows stay at home? We won't need them for another hundred years. An\r\nengine wiper can get a job, but a piano player! Such people can't make\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\n\"My grandfather Alstrom was a musician, and he made good.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie chuckled. \"Oh, a Swede can make good anywhere, at anything!\r\nYou've got that in your favor, miss. Come, you must be getting home.\"\r\n\r\nThea rose. \"Yes, I used to be ashamed of being a Swede, but I'm not any\r\nmore. Swedes are kind of common, but I think it's better to be\r\nSOMETHING.\"\r\n\r\n\"It surely is! How tall you are getting. You come above my shoulder\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll keep on growing, don't you think? I particularly want to be tall.\r\nYes, I guess I must go home. I wish there'd be a fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"A fire?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, so the fire-bell would ring and the roundhouse whistle would blow,\r\nand everybody would come running out. Sometime I'm going to ring the\r\nfire-bell myself and stir them all up.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd be arrested.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that would be better than going to bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll have to lend you some more books.\"\r\n\r\nThea shook herself impatiently. \"I can't read every night.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie gave one of his low, sympathetic chuckles as he opened the\r\ngate for her. \"You're beginning to grow up, that's what's the matter\r\nwith you. I'll have to keep an eye on you. Now you'll have to say\r\ngood-night to the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I won't. I sleep on the floor now, right in the moonlight. My\r\nwindow comes down to the floor, and I can look at the sky all night.\"\r\n\r\nShe shot round the house to the kitchen door, and Dr. Archie watched her\r\ndisappear with a sigh. He thought of the hard, mean, frizzy little woman\r\nwho kept his house for him; once the belle of a Michigan town, now dry\r\nand withered up at thirty. \"If I had a daughter like Thea to watch,\" he\r\nreflected, \"I wouldn't mind anything. I wonder if all of my life's going\r\nto be a mistake just because I made a big one then? Hardly seems fair.\"\r\n\r\nHoward Archie was \"respected\" rather than popular in Moonstone. Everyone\r\nrecognized that he was a good physician, and a progressive Western town\r\nlikes to be able to point to a handsome, well-set-up, well-dressed man\r\namong its citizens. But a great many people thought Archie \"distant,\"\r\nand they were right. He had the uneasy manner of a man who is not among\r\nhis own kind, and who has not seen enough of the world to feel that all\r\npeople are in some sense his own kind. He knew that every one was\r\ncurious about his wife, that she played a sort of character part in\r\nMoonstone, and that people made fun of her, not very delicately. Her own\r\nfriends--most of them women who were distasteful to Archie--liked to ask\r\nher to contribute to church charities, just to see how mean she could\r\nbe. The little, lop-sided cake at the church supper, the cheapest\r\npincushion, the skimpiest apron at the bazaar, were always Mrs. Archie's\r\ncontribution.\r\n\r\nAll this hurt the doctor's pride. But if there was one thing he had\r\nlearned, it was that there was no changing Belle's nature. He had\r\nmarried a mean woman; and he must accept the consequences. Even in\r\nColorado he would have had no pretext for divorce, and, to do him\r\njustice, he had never thought of such a thing. The tenets of the\r\nPresbyterian Church in which he had grown up, though he had long ceased\r\nto believe in them, still influenced his conduct and his conception of\r\npropriety. To him there was something vulgar about divorce. A divorced\r\nman was a disgraced man; at least, he had exhibited his hurt, and made\r\nit a matter for common gossip. Respectability was so necessary to Archie\r\nthat he was willing to pay a high price for it. As long as he could keep\r\nup a decent exterior, he could manage to get on; and if he could have\r\nconcealed his wife's littleness from all his friends, he would scarcely\r\nhave complained. He was more afraid of pity than he was of any\r\nunhappiness. Had there been another woman for whom he cared greatly, he\r\nmight have had plenty of courage; but he was not likely to meet such a\r\nwoman in Moonstone.\r\n\r\nThere was a puzzling timidity in Archie's make-up. The thing that held\r\nhis shoulders stiff, that made him resort to a mirthless little laugh\r\nwhen he was talking to dull people, that made him sometimes stumble over\r\nrugs and carpets, had its counterpart in his mind. He had not the\r\ncourage to be an honest thinker. He could comfort himself by evasions\r\nand compromises. He consoled himself for his own marriage by telling\r\nhimself that other people's were not much better. In his work he saw\r\npretty deeply into marital relations in Moonstone, and he could honestly\r\nsay that there were not many of his friends whom he envied. Their wives\r\nseemed to suit them well enough, but they would never have suited him.\r\n\r\nAlthough Dr. Archie could not bring himself to regard marriage merely as\r\na social contract, but looked upon it as somehow made sacred by a church\r\nin which he did not believe,--as a physician he knew that a young man\r\nwhose marriage is merely nominal must yet go on living his life. When he\r\nwent to Denver or to Chicago, he drifted about in careless company where\r\ngayety and good-humor can be bought, not because he had any taste for\r\nsuch society, but because he honestly believed that anything was better\r\nthan divorce. He often told himself that \"hanging and wiving go by\r\ndestiny.\" If wiving went badly with a man,--and it did oftener than\r\nnot,--then he must do the best he could to keep up appearances and help\r\nthe tradition of domestic happiness along. The Moonstone gossips,\r\nassembled in Mrs. Smiley's millinery and notion store, often discussed\r\nDr. Archie's politeness to his wife, and his pleasant manner of speaking\r\nabout her. \"Nobody has ever got a thing out of him yet,\" they agreed.\r\nAnd it was certainly not because no one had ever tried.\r\n\r\nWhen he was down in Denver, feeling a little jolly, Archie could forget\r\nhow unhappy he was at home, and could even make himself believe that he\r\nmissed his wife. He always bought her presents, and would have liked to\r\nsend her flowers if she had not repeatedly told him never to send her\r\nanything but bulbs,--which did not appeal to him in his expansive\r\nmoments. At the Denver Athletic Club banquets, or at dinner with his\r\ncolleagues at the Brown Palace Hotel, he sometimes spoke sentimentally\r\nabout \"little Mrs. Archie,\" and he always drank the toast \"to our wives,\r\nGod bless them!\" with gusto.\r\n\r\nThe determining factor about Dr. Archie was that he was romantic. He had\r\nmarried Belle White because he was romantic--too romantic to know\r\nanything about women, except what he wished them to be, or to repulse a\r\npretty girl who had set her cap for him. At medical school, though he\r\nwas a rather wild boy in behavior, he had always disliked coarse jokes\r\nand vulgar stories. In his old Flint's Physiology there was still a poem\r\nhe had pasted there when he was a student; some verses by Dr. Oliver\r\nWendell Holmes about the ideals of the medical profession. After so much\r\nand such disillusioning experience with it, he still had a romantic\r\nfeeling about the human body; a sense that finer things dwelt in it than\r\ncould be explained by anatomy. He never jested about birth or death or\r\nmarriage, and did not like to hear other doctors do it. He was a good\r\nnurse, and had a reverence for the bodies of women and children. When he\r\nwas tending them, one saw him at his best. Then his constraint and\r\nself-consciousness fell away from him. He was easy, gentle, competent,\r\nmaster of himself and of other people. Then the idealist in him was not\r\nafraid of being discovered and ridiculed.\r\n\r\nIn his tastes, too, the doctor was romantic. Though he read Balzac all\r\nthe year through, he still enjoyed the Waverley Novels as much as when\r\nhe had first come upon them, in thick leather-bound volumes, in his\r\ngrandfather's library. He nearly always read Scott on Christmas and\r\nholidays, because it brought back the pleasures of his boyhood so\r\nvividly. He liked Scott's women. Constance de Beverley and the minstrel\r\ngirl in \"The Fair Maid of Perth,\" not the Duchesse de Langeais, were his\r\nheroines. But better than anything that ever got from the heart of a man\r\ninto printer's ink, he loved the poetry of Robert Burns. \"Death and Dr.\r\nHornbook\" and \"The Jolly Beggars,\" Burns's \"Reply to his Tailor,\" he\r\noften read aloud to himself in his office, late at night, after a glass\r\nof hot toddy. He used to read \"Tam o'Shanter\" to Thea Kronborg, and he\r\ngot her some of the songs, set to the old airs for which they were\r\nwritten. He loved to hear her sing them. Sometimes when she sang, \"Oh,\r\nwert thou in the cauld blast,\" the doctor and even Mr. Kronborg joined\r\nin. Thea never minded if people could not sing; she directed them with\r\nher head and somehow carried them along. When her father got off the\r\npitch she let her own voice out and covered him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of June, when school closed, Thea had told Wunsch that\r\nshe didn't know how much practicing she could get in this summer because\r\nThor had his worst teeth still to cut.\r\n\r\n\"My God! all last summer he was doing that!\" Wunsch exclaimed furiously.\r\n\r\n\"I know, but it takes them two years, and Thor is slow,\" Thea answered\r\nreprovingly.\r\n\r\nThe summer went well beyond her hopes, however. She told herself that it\r\nwas the best summer of her life, so far. Nobody was sick at home, and\r\nher lessons were uninterrupted. Now that she had four pupils of her own\r\nand made a dollar a week, her practicing was regarded more seriously by\r\nthe household. Her mother had always arranged things so that she could\r\nhave the parlor four hours a day in summer. Thor proved a friendly ally.\r\nHe behaved handsomely about his molars, and never objected to being\r\npulled off into remote places in his cart. When Thea dragged him over\r\nthe hill and made a camp under the shade of a bush or a bank, he would\r\nwaddle about and play with his blocks, or bury his monkey in the sand\r\nand dig him up again. Sometimes he got into the cactus and set up a\r\nhowl, but usually he let his sister read peacefully, while he coated his\r\nhands and face, first with an all-day sucker and then with gravel.\r\n\r\nLife was pleasant and uneventful until the first of September, when\r\nWunsch began to drink so hard that he was unable to appear when Thea\r\nwent to take her mid-week lesson, and Mrs. Kohler had to send her home\r\nafter a tearful apology. On Saturday morning she set out for the\r\nKohlers' again, but on her way, when she was crossing the ravine, she\r\nnoticed a woman sitting at the bottom of the gulch, under the railroad\r\ntrestle. She turned from her path and saw that it was Mrs. Tellamantez,\r\nand she seemed to be doing drawn-work. Then Thea noticed that there was\r\nsomething beside her, covered up with a purple and yellow Mexican\r\nblanket. She ran up the gulch and called to Mrs. Tellamantez. The\r\nMexican woman held up a warning finger. Thea glanced at the blanket and\r\nrecognized a square red hand which protruded. The middle finger twitched\r\nslightly.\r\n\r\n\"Is he hurt?\" she gasped.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tellamantez shook her head. \"No; very sick. He knows nothing,\" she\r\nsaid quietly, folding her hands over her drawn-work.\r\n\r\nThea learned that Wunsch had been out all night, that this morning Mrs.\r\nKohler had gone to look for him and found him under the trestle covered\r\nwith dirt and cinders. Probably he had been trying to get home and had\r\nlost his way. Mrs. Tellamantez was watching beside the unconscious man\r\nwhile Mrs. Kohler and Johnny went to get help.\r\n\r\n\"You better go home now, I think,\" said Mrs. Tellamantez, in closing her\r\nnarration.\r\n\r\nThea hung her head and looked wistfully toward the blanket.\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't I just stay till they come?\" she asked. \"I'd like to know if\r\nhe's very bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bad enough,\" sighed Mrs. Tellamantez, taking up her work again.\r\n\r\nThea sat down under the narrow shade of one of the trestle posts and\r\nlistened to the locusts rasping in the hot sand while she watched Mrs.\r\nTellamantez evenly draw her threads. The blanket looked as if it were\r\nover a heap of bricks.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see him breathing any,\" she said anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he breathes,\" said Mrs. Tellamantez, not lifting her eyes.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Thea that they waited for hours. At last they heard voices,\r\nand a party of men came down the hill and up the gulch. Dr. Archie and\r\nFritz Kohler came first; behind were Johnny and Ray, and several men\r\nfrom the roundhouse. Ray had the canvas litter that was kept at the\r\ndepot for accidents on the road. Behind them trailed half a dozen boys\r\nwho had been hanging round the depot.\r\n\r\nWhen Ray saw Thea, he dropped his canvas roll and hurried forward.\r\n\"Better run along home, Thee. This is ugly business.\" Ray was indignant\r\nthat anybody who gave Thea music lessons should behave in such a manner.\r\n\r\nThea resented both his proprietary tone and his superior virtue. \"I\r\nwon't. I want to know how bad he is. I'm not a baby!\" she exclaimed\r\nindignantly, stamping her foot into the sand.\r\n\r\nDr. Archie, who had been kneeling by the blanket, got up and came toward\r\nThea, dusting his knees. He smiled and nodded confidentially. \"He'll be\r\nall right when we get him home. But he wouldn't want you to see him like\r\nthis, poor old chap! Understand? Now, skip!\"\r\n\r\nThea ran down the gulch and looked back only once, to see them lifting\r\nthe canvas litter with Wunsch upon it, still covered with the blanket.\r\n\r\nThe men carried Wunsch up the hill and down the road to the Kohlers'.\r\nMrs. Kohler had gone home and made up a bed in the sitting-room, as she\r\nknew the litter could not be got round the turn in the narrow stairway.\r\nWunsch was like a dead man. He lay unconscious all day. Ray Kennedy\r\nstayed with him till two o'clock in the afternoon, when he had to go out\r\non his run. It was the first time he had ever been inside the Kohlers'\r\nhouse, and he was so much impressed by Napoleon that the piece-picture\r\nformed a new bond between him and Thea.\r\n\r\nDr. Archie went back at six o'clock, and found Mrs. Kohler and Spanish\r\nJohnny with Wunsch, who was in a high fever, muttering and groaning.\r\n\r\n\"There ought to be some one here to look after him to-night, Mrs.\r\nKohler,\" he said. \"I'm on a confinement case, and I can't be here, but\r\nthere ought to be somebody. He may get violent.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Kohler insisted that she could always do anything with Wunsch, but\r\nthe doctor shook his head and Spanish Johnny grinned. He said he would\r\nstay. The doctor laughed at him. \"Ten fellows like you couldn't hold\r\nhim, Spanish, if he got obstreperous; an Irishman would have his hands\r\nfull. Guess I'd better put the soft pedal on him.\" He pulled out his\r\nhypodermic.\r\n\r\nSpanish Johnny stayed, however, and the Kohlers went to bed. At about\r\ntwo o'clock in the morning Wunsch rose from his ignominious cot. Johnny,\r\nwho was dozing on the lounge, awoke to find the German standing in the\r\nmiddle of the room in his undershirt and drawers, his arms bare, his\r\nheavy body seeming twice its natural girth. His face was snarling and\r\nsavage, and his eyes were crazy. He had risen to avenge himself, to wipe\r\nout his shame, to destroy his enemy. One look was enough for Johnny.\r\nWunsch raised a chair threateningly, and Johnny, with the lightness of a\r\nPICADOR, darted under the missile and out of the open window. He shot\r\nacross the gully to get help, meanwhile leaving the Kohlers to their\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nFritz, upstairs, heard the chair crash upon the stove. Then he heard\r\ndoors opening and shutting, and some one stumbling about in the\r\nshrubbery of the garden. He and Paulina sat up in bed and held a\r\nconsultation. Fritz slipped from under the covers, and going cautiously\r\nover to the window, poked out his head. Then he rushed to the door and\r\nbolted it.\r\n\r\n\"MEIN GOTT, Paulina,\" he gasped, \"he has the axe, he will kill us!\"\r\n\r\n\"The dresser,\" cried Mrs. Kohler; \"push the dresser before the door.\r\nACH, if you had your rabbit gun, now!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is in the barn,\" said Fritz sadly. \"It would do no good; he would\r\nnot be afraid of anything now. Stay you in the bed, Paulina.\" The\r\ndresser had lost its casters years ago, but he managed to drag it in\r\nfront of the door. \"He is in the garden. He makes nothing. He will get\r\nsick again, may-be.\"\r\n\r\nFritz went back to bed and his wife pulled the quilt over him and made\r\nhim lie down. They heard stumbling in the garden again, then a smash of\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n\"ACH, DAS MISTBEET!\" gasped Paulina, hearing her hotbed shivered. \"The\r\npoor soul, Fritz, he will cut himself. ACH! what is that?\" They both sat\r\nup in bed. \"WIEDER! ACH, What is he doing?\"\r\n\r\nThe noise came steadily, a sound of chopping. Paulina tore off her\r\nnight-cap. \"DIE BAUME, DIE BAUME! He is cutting our trees, Fritz!\" Before\r\nher husband could prevent her, she had sprung from the bed and rushed to\r\nthe window. \"DER TAUBENSCHLAG! GERECHTER HIMMEL, he is chopping the\r\ndove-house down!\"\r\n\r\nFritz reached her side before she had got her breath again, and poked\r\nhis head out beside hers. There, in the faint starlight, they saw a\r\nbulky man, barefoot, half dressed, chopping away at the white post that\r\nformed the pedestal of the dove-house. The startled pigeons were\r\ncroaking and flying about his head, even beating their wings in his\r\nface, so that he struck at them furiously with the axe. In a few seconds\r\nthere was a crash, and Wunsch had actually felled the dove-house.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if only it is not the trees next!\" prayed Paulina. \"The dove-house\r\nyou can make new again, but not DIE BAUME.\"\r\n\r\nThey watched breathlessly. In the garden below Wunsch stood in the\r\nattitude of a woodman, contemplating the fallen cote. Suddenly he threw\r\nthe axe over his shoulder and went out of the front gate toward the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n\"The poor soul, he will meet his death!\" Mrs. Kohler wailed. She ran\r\nback to her feather bed and hid her face in the pillow.\r\n\r\nFritz kept watch at the window. \"No, no, Paulina,\" he called presently;\r\n\"I see lanterns coming. Johnny must have gone for somebody. Yes, four\r\nlanterns, coming along the gulch. They stop; they must have seen him\r\nalready. Now they are under the hill and I cannot see them, but I think\r\nthey have him. They will bring him back. I must dress and go down.\" He\r\ncaught his trousers and began pulling them on by the window. \"Yes, here\r\nthey come, half a dozen men. And they have tied him with a rope,\r\nPaulina!\"\r\n\r\n\"ACH, the poor man! To be led like a cow,\" groaned Mrs. Kohler. \"Oh, it\r\nis good that he has no wife!\" She was reproaching herself for nagging\r\nFritz when he drank himself into foolish pleasantry or mild sulks, and\r\nfelt that she had never before appreciated her blessings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWunsch was in bed for ten days, during which time he was gossiped about\r\nand even preached about in Moonstone. The Baptist preacher took a shot\r\nat the fallen man from his pulpit, Mrs. Livery Johnson nodding\r\napprovingly from her pew. The mothers of Wunsch's pupils sent him notes\r\ninforming him that their daughters would discontinue their\r\nmusic-lessons. The old maid who had rented him her piano sent the town\r\ndray for her contaminated instrument, and ever afterward declared that\r\nWunsch had ruined its tone and scarred its glossy finish. The Kohlers\r\nwere unremitting in their kindness to their friend. Mrs. Kohler made him\r\nsoups and broths without stint, and Fritz repaired the dove-house and\r\nmounted it on a new post, lest it might be a sad reminder.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Wunsch was strong enough to sit about in his slippers and\r\nwadded jacket, he told Fritz to bring him some stout thread from the\r\nshop. When Fritz asked what he was going to sew, he produced the\r\ntattered score of \"Orpheus\" and said he would like to fix it up for a\r\nlittle present. Fritz carried it over to the shop and stitched it into\r\npasteboards, covered with dark suiting-cloth. Over the stitches he glued\r\na strip of thin red leather which he got from his friend, the\r\nharness-maker. After Paulina had cleaned the pages with fresh bread,\r\nWunsch was amazed to see what a fine book he had. It opened stiffly, but\r\nthat was no matter.\r\n\r\nSitting in the arbor one morning, under the ripe grapes and the brown,\r\ncurling leaves, with a pen and ink on the bench beside him and the Gluck\r\nscore on his knee, Wunsch pondered for a long while. Several times he\r\ndipped the pen in the ink, and then put it back again in the cigar box\r\nin which Mrs. Kohler kept her writing utensils. His thoughts wandered\r\nover a wide territory; over many countries and many years. There was no\r\norder or logical sequence in his ideas. Pictures came and went without\r\nreason. Faces, mountains, rivers, autumn days in other vineyards far\r\naway. He thought of a FUSZREISE he had made through the Hartz Mountains\r\nin his student days; of the innkeeper's pretty daughter who had lighted\r\nhis pipe for him in the garden one summer evening, of the woods above\r\nWiesbaden, haymakers on an island in the river. The roundhouse whistle\r\nwoke him from his reveries. Ah, yes, he was in Moonstone, Colorado. He\r\nfrowned for a moment and looked at the book on his knee. He had thought\r\nof a great many appropriate things to write in it, but suddenly he\r\nrejected all of them, opened the book, and at the top of the\r\nmuch-engraved title-page he wrote rapidly in purple ink:--\r\n\r\n     EINST, O WUNDER!--\r\n\r\n     A. WUNSCH.\r\n     MOONSTONE, COLO.\r\n     SEPTEMBER 30, 18--\r\n\r\n\r\nNobody in Moonstone ever found what Wunsch's first name was. That \"A\"\r\nmay have stood for Adam, or August, or even Amadeus; he got very angry\r\nif any one asked him.\r\n\r\nHe remained A. Wunsch to the end of his chapter there. When he presented\r\nthis score to Thea, he told her that in ten years she would either know\r\nwhat the inscription meant, or she would not have the least idea, in\r\nwhich case it would not matter.\r\n\r\nWhen Wunsch began to pack his trunk, both the Kohlers were very unhappy.\r\nHe said he was coming back some day, but that for the present, since he\r\nhad lost all his pupils, it would be better for him to try some \"new\r\ntown.\" Mrs. Kohler darned and mended all his clothes, and gave him two\r\nnew shirts she had made for Fritz. Fritz made him a new pair of trousers\r\nand would have made him an overcoat but for the fact that overcoats were\r\nso easy to pawn.\r\n\r\nWunsch would not go across the ravine to the town until he went to take\r\nthe morning train for Denver. He said that after he got to Denver he\r\nwould \"look around.\" He left Moonstone one bright October morning,\r\nwithout telling any one good-bye. He bought his ticket and went directly\r\ninto the smoking-car. When the train was beginning to pull out, he heard\r\nhis name called frantically, and looking out of the window he saw Thea\r\nKronborg standing on the siding, bareheaded and panting. Some boys had\r\nbrought word to school that they saw Wunsch's trunk going over to the\r\nstation, and Thea had run away from school. She was at the end of the\r\nstation platform, her hair in two braids, her blue gingham dress wet to\r\nthe knees because she had run across lots through the weeds. It had\r\nrained during the night, and the tall sunflowers behind her were fresh\r\nand shining.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, Herr Wunsch, good-bye!\" she called waving to him.\r\n\r\nHe thrust his head out at the car window and called back, \"LEBEN SIE\r\nWOHL, LEBEN SIE WOHL, MEIN KIND!\" He watched her until the train swept\r\naround the curve beyond the roundhouse, and then sank back into his\r\nseat, muttering, \"She had been running. Ah, she will run a long way;\r\nthey cannot stop her!\"\r\n\r\nWhat was it about the child that one believed in? Was it her dogged\r\nindustry, so unusual in this free-and-easy country? Was it her\r\nimagination? More likely it was because she had both imagination and a\r\nstubborn will, curiously balancing and interpenetrating each other.\r\nThere was something unconscious and unawakened about her, that tempted\r\ncuriosity. She had a kind of seriousness that he had not met with in a\r\npupil before. She hated difficult things, and yet she could never pass\r\none by. They seemed to challenge her; she had no peace until she\r\nmastered them. She had the power to make a great effort, to lift a\r\nweight heavier than herself. Wunsch hoped he would always remember her\r\nas she stood by the track, looking up at him; her broad eager face, so\r\nfair in color, with its high cheek-bones, yellow eyebrows and\r\ngreenishhazel eyes. It was a face full of light and energy, of the\r\nunquestioning hopefulness of first youth. Yes, she was like a flower\r\nfull of sun, but not the soft German flowers of his childhood. He had it\r\nnow, the comparison he had absently reached for before: she was like the\r\nyellow prickly pear blossoms that open there in the desert; thornier and\r\nsturdier than the maiden flowers he remembered; not so sweet, but\r\nwonderful.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night Mrs. Kohler brushed away many a tear as she got supper and\r\nset the table for two. When they sat down, Fritz was more silent than\r\nusual. People who have lived long together need a third at table: they\r\nknow each other's thoughts so well that they have nothing left to say.\r\nMrs. Kohler stirred and stirred her coffee and clattered the spoon, but\r\nshe had no heart for her supper. She felt, for the first time in years,\r\nthat she was tired of her own cooking. She looked across the glass lamp\r\nat her husband and asked him if the butcher liked his new overcoat, and\r\nwhether he had got the shoulders right in a ready-made suit he was\r\npatching over for Ray Kennedy. After supper Fritz offered to wipe the\r\ndishes for her, but she told him to go about his business, and not to\r\nact as if she were sick or getting helpless.\r\n\r\nWhen her work in the kitchen was all done, she went out to cover the\r\noleanders against frost, and to take a last look at her chickens. As she\r\ncame back from the hen-house she stopped by one of the linden trees and\r\nstood resting her hand on the trunk. He would never come back, the poor\r\nman; she knew that. He would drift on from new town to new town, from\r\ncatastrophe to catastrophe. He would hardly find a good home for himself\r\nagain. He would die at last in some rough place, and be buried in the\r\ndesert or on the wild prairie, far enough from any linden tree!\r\n\r\nFritz, smoking his pipe on the kitchen doorstep, watched his Paulina and\r\nguessed her thoughts. He, too, was sorry to lose his friend. But Fritz\r\nwas getting old; he had lived a long while and had learned to lose\r\nwithout struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\"Mother,\" said Peter Kronborg to his wife one morning about two weeks\r\nafter Wunsch's departure, \"how would you like to drive out to Copper\r\nHole with me to-day?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Kronborg said she thought she would enjoy the drive. She put on her\r\ngray cashmere dress and gold watch and chain, as befitted a minister's\r\nwife, and while her husband was dressing she packed a black oilcloth\r\nsatchel with such clothing as she and Thor would need overnight.\r\n\r\nCopper Hole was a settlement fifteen miles northwest of Moonstone where\r\nMr. Kronborg preached every Friday evening. There was a big spring there\r\nand a creek and a few irrigating ditches. It was a community of\r\ndiscouraged agriculturists who had disastrously experimented with dry\r\nfarming. Mr. Kronborg always drove out one day and back the next,\r\nspending the night with one of his parishioners. Often, when the weather\r\nwas fine, his wife accompanied him. To-day they set out from home after\r\nthe midday meal, leaving Tillie in charge of the house. Mrs. Kronborg's\r\nmaternal feeling was always garnered up in the baby, whoever the baby\r\nhappened to be. If she had the baby with her, the others could look out\r\nfor themselves. Thor, of course, was not, accurately speaking, a baby\r\nany longer. In the matter of nourishment he was quite independent of his\r\nmother, though this independence had not been won without a struggle.\r\nThor was conservative in all things, and the whole family had anguished\r\nwith him when he was being weaned. Being the youngest, he was still the\r\nbaby for Mrs. Kronborg, though he was nearly four years old and sat up\r\nboldly on her lap this afternoon, holding on to the ends of the lines\r\nand shouting \"'mup, 'mup, horsey.\" His father watched him affectionately\r\nand hummed hymn tunes in the jovial way that was sometimes such a trial\r\nto Thea.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kronborg was enjoying the sunshine and the brilliant sky and all\r\nthe faintly marked features of the dazzling, monotonous landscape. She\r\nhad a rather unusual capacity for getting the flavor of places and of\r\npeople. Although she was so enmeshed in family cares most of the time,\r\nshe could emerge serene when she was away from them. For a mother of\r\nseven, she had a singularly unprejudiced point of view. She was,\r\nmoreover, a fatalist, and as she did not attempt to direct things beyond\r\nher control, she found a good deal of time to enjoy the ways of man and\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nWhen they were well upon their road, out where the first lean pasture\r\nlands began and the sand grass made a faint showing between the\r\nsagebrushes, Mr. Kronborg dropped his tune and turned to his wife.\r\n\"Mother, I've been thinking about something.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guessed you had. What is it?\" She shifted Thor to her left knee,\r\nwhere he would be more out of the way.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's about Thea. Mr. Follansbee came to my study at the church\r\nthe other day and said they would like to have their two girls take\r\nlessons of Thea. Then I sounded Miss Meyers\" (Miss Meyers was the\r\norganist in Mr. Kronborg's church) \"and she said there was a good deal\r\nof talk about whether Thea wouldn't take over Wunsch's pupils. She said\r\nif Thea stopped school she wouldn't wonder if she could get pretty much\r\nall Wunsch's class. People think Thea knows about all Wunsch could\r\nteach.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Kronborg looked thoughtful. \"Do you think we ought to take her out\r\nof school so young?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is young, but next year would be her last year anyway. She's far\r\nalong for her age. And she can't learn much under the principal we've\r\ngot now, can she?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm afraid she can't,\" his wife admitted. \"She frets a good deal\r\nand says that man always has to look in the back of the book for the\r\nanswers. She hates all that diagramming they have to do, and I think\r\nmyself it's a waste of time.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kronborg settled himself back into the seat and slowed the mare to a\r\nwalk. \"You see, it occurs to me that we might raise Thea's prices, so it\r\nwould be worth her while. Seventy-five cents for hour lessons, fifty\r\ncents for half-hour lessons. If she got, say two thirds of Wunsch's\r\nclass, that would bring her in upwards of ten dollars a week. Better pay\r\nthan teaching a country school, and there would be more work in vacation\r\nthan in winter. Steady work twelve months in the year; that's an\r\nadvantage. And she'd be living at home, with no expenses.\"\r\n\r\n\"There'd be talk if you raised her prices,\" said Mrs. Kronborg\r\ndubiously.\r\n\r\n\"At first there would. But Thea is so much the best musician in town\r\nthat they'd all come into line after a while. A good many people in\r\nMoonstone have been making money lately, and have bought new pianos.\r\nThere were ten new pianos shipped in here from Denver in the last year.\r\nPeople ain't going to let them stand idle; too much money invested. I\r\nbelieve Thea can have as many scholars as she can handle, if we set her\r\nup a little.\"\r\n\r\n\"How set her up, do you mean?\" Mrs. Kronborg felt a certain reluctance\r\nabout accepting this plan, though she had not yet had time to think out\r\nher reasons.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've been thinking for some time we could make good use of\r\nanother room. We couldn't give up the parlor to her all the time. If we\r\nbuilt another room on the ell and put the piano in there, she could give\r\nlessons all day long and it wouldn't bother us. We could build a\r\nclothes-press in it, and put in a bed-lounge and a dresser and let Anna\r\nhave it for her sleeping-room. She needs a place of her own, now that\r\nshe's beginning to be dressy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seems like Thea ought to have the choice of the room, herself,\" said\r\nMrs. Kronborg.\r\n\r\n\"But, my dear, she don't want it. Won't have it. I sounded her coming\r\nhome from church on Sunday; asked her if she would like to sleep in a\r\nnew room, if we built on. She fired up like a little wild-cat and said\r\nshe'd made her own room all herself, and she didn't think anybody ought\r\nto take it away from her.\"\r\n\r\n\"She don't mean to be impertinent, father. She's made decided that way,\r\nlike my father.\" Mrs. Kronborg spoke warmly. \"I never have any trouble\r\nwith the child. I remember my father's ways and go at her carefully.\r\nThea's all right.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kronborg laughed indulgently and pinched Thor's full cheek. \"Oh, I\r\ndidn't mean anything against your girl, mother! She's all right, but\r\nshe's a little wild-cat, just the same. I think Ray Kennedy's planning\r\nto spoil a born old maid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh! She'll get something a good sight better than Ray Kennedy, you\r\nsee! Thea's an awful smart girl. I've seen a good many girls take music\r\nlessons in my time, but I ain't seen one that took to it so. Wunsch said\r\nso, too. She's got the making of something in her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't deny that, and the sooner she gets at it in a businesslike way,\r\nthe better. She's the kind that takes responsibility, and it'll be good\r\nfor her.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Kronborg was thoughtful. \"In some ways it will, maybe. But there's\r\na good deal of strain about teaching youngsters, and she's always worked\r\nso hard with the scholars she has. I've often listened to her pounding\r\nit into 'em. I don't want to work her too hard. She's so serious that\r\nshe's never had what you might call any real childhood. Seems like she\r\nought to have the next few years sort of free and easy. She'll be tied\r\ndown with responsibilities soon enough.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kronborg patted his wife's arm. \"Don't you believe it, mother. Thea\r\nis not the marrying kind. I've watched 'em. Anna will marry before long\r\nand make a good wife, but I don't see Thea bringing up a family. She's\r\ngot a good deal of her mother in her, but she hasn't got all. She's too\r\npeppery and too fond of having her own way. Then she's always got to be\r\nahead in everything. That kind make good church-workers and missionaries\r\nand school teachers, but they don't make good wives. They fret all their\r\nenergy away, like colts, and get cut on the wire.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Kronborg laughed. \"Give me the graham crackers I put in your pocket\r\nfor Thor. He's hungry. You're a funny man, Peter. A body wouldn't think,\r\nto hear you, you was talking about your own daughters. I guess you see\r\nthrough 'em. Still, even if Thea ain't apt to have children of her own,\r\nI don't know as that's a good reason why she should wear herself out on\r\nother people's.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just the point, mother. A girl with all that energy has got to\r\ndo something, same as a boy, to keep her out of mischief. If you don't\r\nwant her to marry Ray, let her do something to make herself\r\nindependent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm not against it. It might be the best thing for her. I wish I\r\nfelt sure she wouldn't worry. She takes things hard. She nearly cried\r\nherself sick about Wunsch's going away. She's the smartest child of 'em\r\nall, Peter, by a long ways.\"\r\n\r\nPeter Kronborg smiled. \"There you go, Anna. That's you all over again.\r\nNow, I have no favorites; they all have their good points. But you,\"\r\nwith a twinkle, \"always did go in for brains.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Kronborg chuckled as she wiped the cracker crumbs from Thor's chin\r\nand fists. \"Well, you're mighty conceited, Peter! But I don't know as I\r\never regretted it. I prefer having a family of my own to fussing with\r\nother folks' children, that's the truth.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the Kronborgs reached Copper Hole, Thea's destiny was pretty well\r\nmapped out for her. Mr. Kronborg was always delighted to have an excuse\r\nfor enlarging the house.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kronborg was quite right in her conjecture that there would be\r\nunfriendly comment in Moonstone when Thea raised her prices for\r\nmusic-lessons. People said she was getting too conceited for anything.\r\nMrs. Livery Johnson put on a new bonnet and paid up all her back calls\r\nto have the pleasure of announcing in each parlor she entered that her\r\ndaughters, at least, would \"never pay professional prices to Thea\r\nKronborg.\"\r\n\r\nThea raised no objection to quitting school. She was now in the \"high\r\nroom,\" as it was called, in next to the highest class, and was studying\r\ngeometry and beginning Caesar. She no longer recited her lessons to the\r\nteacher she liked, but to the Principal, a man who belonged, like Mrs.\r\nLivery Johnson, to the camp of Thea's natural enemies. He taught school\r\nbecause he was too lazy to work among grown-up people, and he made an\r\neasy job of it. He got out of real work by inventing useless activities\r\nfor his pupils, such as the \"tree-diagramming system.\" Thea had spent\r\nhours making trees out of \"Thanatopsis,\" Hamlet's soliloquy, Cato on\r\n\"Immortality.\" She agonized under this waste of time, and was only too\r\nglad to accept her father's offer of liberty.\r\n\r\nSo Thea left school the first of November. By the first of January she\r\nhad eight one-hour pupils and ten half-hour pupils, and there would be\r\nmore in the summer. She spent her earnings generously. She bought a new\r\nBrussels carpet for the parlor, and a rifle for Gunner and Axel, and an\r\nimitation tiger-skin coat and cap for Thor. She enjoyed being able to\r\nadd to the family possessions, and thought Thor looked quite as handsome\r\nin his spots as the rich children she had seen in Denver. Thor was most\r\ncomplacent in his conspicuous apparel. He could walk anywhere by this\r\ntime--though he always preferred to sit, or to be pulled in his cart. He\r\nwas a blissfully lazy child, and had a number of long, dull plays, such\r\nas making nests for his china duck and waiting for her to lay him an\r\negg. Thea thought him very intelligent, and she was proud that he was so\r\nbig and burly. She found him restful, loved to hear him call her\r\n\"sitter,\" and really liked his companionship, especially when she was\r\ntired. On Saturday, for instance, when she taught from nine in the\r\nmorning until five in the afternoon, she liked to get off in a corner\r\nwith Thor after supper, away from all the bathing and dressing and\r\njoking and talking that went on in the house, and ask him about his\r\nduck, or hear him tell one of his rambling stories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nBy the time Thea's fifteenth birthday came round, she was established as\r\na music teacher in Moonstone. The new room had been added to the house\r\nearly in the spring, and Thea had been giving her lessons there since\r\nthe middle of May. She liked the personal independence which was\r\naccorded her as a wage-earner. The family questioned her comings and\r\ngoings very little. She could go buggy-riding with Ray Kennedy, for\r\ninstance, without taking Gunner or Axel. She could go to Spanish\r\nJohnny's and sing part songs with the Mexicans, and nobody objected.\r\n\r\nThea was still under the first excitement of teaching, and was terribly\r\nin earnest about it. If a pupil did not get on well, she fumed and\r\nfretted. She counted until she was hoarse. She listened to scales in her\r\nsleep. Wunsch had taught only one pupil seriously, but Thea taught\r\ntwenty. The duller they were, the more furiously she poked and prodded\r\nthem. With the little girls she was nearly always patient, but with\r\npupils older than herself, she sometimes lost her temper. One of her\r\nmistakes was to let herself in for a calling-down from Mrs. Livery\r\nJohnson. That lady appeared at the Kronborgs' one morning and announced\r\nthat she would allow no girl to stamp her foot at her daughter Grace.\r\nShe added that Thea's bad manners with the older girls were being talked\r\nabout all over town, and that if her temper did not speedily improve she\r\nwould lose all her advanced pupils. Thea was frightened. She felt she\r\ncould never bear the disgrace, if such a thing happened. Besides, what\r\nwould her father say, after he had gone to the expense of building an\r\naddition to the house? Mrs. Johnson demanded an apology to Grace. Thea\r\nsaid she was willing to make it. Mrs. Johnson said that hereafter, since\r\nshe had taken lessons of the best piano teacher in Grinnell, Iowa, she\r\nherself would decide what pieces Grace should study. Thea readily\r\nconsented to that, and Mrs. Johnson rustled away to tell a neighbor\r\nwoman that Thea Kronborg could be meek enough when you went at her\r\nright.\r\n\r\nThea was telling Ray about this unpleasant encounter as they were\r\ndriving out to the sand hills the next Sunday.\r\n\r\n\"She was stuffing you, all right, Thee,\" Ray reassured her. \"There's no\r\ngeneral dissatisfaction among your scholars. She just wanted to get in a\r\nknock. I talked to the piano tuner the last time he was here, and he\r\nsaid all the people he tuned for expressed themselves very favorably\r\nabout your teaching. I wish you didn't take so much pains with them,\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have to, Ray. They're all so dumb. They've got no ambition,\" Thea\r\nexclaimed irritably. \"Jenny Smiley is the only one who isn't stupid. She\r\ncan read pretty well, and she has such good hands. But she don't care a\r\nrap about it. She has no pride.\"\r\n\r\nRay's face was full of complacent satisfaction as he glanced sidewise at\r\nThea, but she was looking off intently into the mirage, at one of those\r\nmammoth cattle that are nearly always reflected there. \"Do you find it\r\neasier to teach in your new room?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I'm not interrupted so much. Of course, if I ever happen to want\r\nto practice at night, that's always the night Anna chooses to go to bed\r\nearly.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a darned shame, Thee, you didn't cop that room for yourself. I'm\r\nsore at the PADRE about that. He ought to give you that room. You could\r\nfix it up so pretty.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't want it, honest I didn't. Father would have let me have it. I\r\nlike my own room better. Somehow I can think better in a little room.\r\nBesides, up there I am away from everybody, and I can read as late as I\r\nplease and nobody nags me.\"\r\n\r\n\"A growing girl needs lots of sleep,\" Ray providently remarked.\r\n\r\nThea moved restlessly on the buggy cushions. \"They need other things\r\nmore,\" she muttered. \"Oh, I forgot. I brought something to show you.\r\nLook here, it came on my birthday. Wasn't it nice of him to remember?\"\r\nShe took from her pocket a postcard, bent in the middle and folded, and\r\nhanded it to Ray. On it was a white dove, perched on a wreath of very\r\nblue forget-me-nots, and \"Birthday Greetings\" in gold letters. Under\r\nthis was written, \"From A. Wunsch.\"\r\n\r\nRay turned the card over, examined the postmark, and then began to\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\"Concord, Kansas. He has my sympathy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, is that a poor town?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the jumping-off place, no town at all. Some houses dumped down in\r\nthe middle of a cornfield. You get lost in the corn. Not even a saloon\r\nto keep things going; sell whiskey without a license at the butcher\r\nshop, beer on ice with the liver and beefsteak. I wouldn't stay there\r\nover Sunday for a ten-dollar bill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear! What do you suppose he's doing there? Maybe he just stopped\r\noff there a few days to tune pianos,\" Thea suggested hopefully.\r\n\r\nRay gave her back the card. \"He's headed in the wrong direction. What\r\ndoes he want to get back into a grass country for? Now, there are lots\r\nof good live towns down on the Santa Fe, and everybody down there is\r\nmusical. He could always get a job playing in saloons if he was\r\ndead broke. I've figured out that I've got no years of my life to waste\r\nin a Methodist country where they raise pork.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must stop on our way back and show this card to Mrs. Kohler. She\r\nmisses him so.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the way, Thee, I hear the old woman goes to church every Sunday to\r\nhear you sing. Fritz tells me he has to wait till two o'clock for his\r\nSunday dinner these days. The church people ought to give you credit for\r\nthat, when they go for you.\"\r\n\r\nThea shook her head and spoke in a tone of resignation. \"They'll always\r\ngo for me, just as they did for Wunsch. It wasn't because he drank they\r\nwent for him; not really. It was something else.\"\r\n\r\n\"You want to salt your money down, Thee, and go to Chicago and take some\r\nlessons. Then you come back, and wear a long feather and high heels and\r\nput on a few airs, and that'll fix 'em. That's what they like.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll never have money enough to go to Chicago. Mother meant to lend me\r\nsome, I think, but now they've got hard times back in Nebraska, and her\r\nfarm don't bring her in anything. Takes all the tenant can raise to pay\r\nthe taxes. Don't let's talk about that. You promised to tell me about\r\nthe play you went to see in Denver.\"\r\n\r\nAny one would have liked to hear Ray's simple and clear account of the\r\nperformance he had seen at the Tabor Grand Opera House--Maggie Mitchell\r\nin LITTLE BAREFOOT--and any one would have liked to watch his kind face.\r\nRay looked his best out of doors, when his thick red hands were covered\r\nby gloves, and the dull red of his sunburned face somehow seemed right\r\nin the light and wind. He looked better, too, with his hat on; his hair\r\nwas thin and dry, with no particular color or character, \"regular\r\nWilly-boy hair,\" as he himself described it. His eyes were pale beside\r\nthe reddish bronze of his skin. They had the faded look often seen in\r\nthe eyes of men who have lived much in the sun and wind and who have\r\nbeen accustomed to train their vision upon distant objects.\r\n\r\nRay realized that Thea's life was dull and exacting, and that she missed\r\nWunsch. He knew she worked hard, that she put up with a great many\r\nlittle annoyances, and that her duties as a teacher separated her more\r\nthan ever from the boys and girls of her own age. He did everything he\r\ncould to provide recreation for her. He brought her candy and magazines\r\nand pineapples--of which she was very fond--from Denver, and kept his\r\neyes and ears open for anything that might interest her. He was, of\r\ncourse, living for Thea. He had thought it all out carefully and had\r\nmade up his mind just when he would speak to her. When she was\r\nseventeen, then he would tell her his plan and ask her to marry him. He\r\nwould be willing to wait two, or even three years, until she was twenty,\r\nif she thought best. By that time he would surely have got in on\r\nsomething: copper, oil, gold, silver, sheep,--something.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, it was pleasure enough to feel that she depended on him more\r\nand more, that she leaned upon his steady kindness. He never broke faith\r\nwith himself about her; he never hinted to her of his hopes for the\r\nfuture, never suggested that she might be more intimately confidential\r\nwith him, or talked to her of the thing he thought about so constantly.\r\nHe had the chivalry which is perhaps the proudest possession of his\r\nrace. He had never embarrassed her by so much as a glance. Sometimes,\r\nwhen they drove out to the sand hills, he let his left arm lie along the\r\nback of the buggy seat, but it never came any nearer to Thea than that,\r\nnever touched her. He often turned to her a face full of pride, and\r\nfrank admiration, but his glance was never so intimate or so penetrating\r\nas Dr. Archie's. His blue eyes were clear and shallow, friendly,\r\nuninquiring. He rested Thea because he was so different; because, though\r\nhe often told her interesting things, he never set lively fancies going\r\nin her head; because he never misunderstood her, and because he never,\r\nby any chance, for a single instant, understood her! Yes, with Ray she\r\nwas safe; by him she would never be discovered!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nThe pleasantest experience Thea had that summer was a trip that she and\r\nher mother made to Denver in Ray Kennedy's caboose. Mrs. Kronborg had\r\nbeen looking forward to this excursion for a long while, but as Ray\r\nnever knew at what hour his freight would leave Moonstone, it was\r\ndifficult to arrange. The call-boy was as likely to summon him to start\r\non his run at twelve o'clock midnight as at twelve o'clock noon. The\r\nfirst week in June started out with all the scheduled trains running on\r\ntime, and a light freight business. Tuesday evening Ray, after\r\nconsulting with the dispatcher, stopped at the Kronborgs' front gate to\r\ntell Mrs. Kronborg--who was helping Tillie water the flowers--that if\r\nshe and Thea could be at the depot at eight o'clock the next morning, he\r\nthought he could promise them a pleasant ride and get them into Denver\r\nbefore nine o'clock in the evening. Mrs. Kronborg told him cheerfully,\r\nacross the fence, that she would \"take him up on it,\" and Ray hurried\r\nback to the yards to scrub out his car.\r\n\r\nThe one complaint Ray's brakemen had to make of him was that he was too\r\nfussy about his caboose. His former brakeman had asked to be transferred\r\nbecause, he said, \"Kennedy was as fussy about his car as an old maid\r\nabout her bird-cage.\" Joe Giddy, who was braking with Ray now, called\r\nhim \"the bride,\" because he kept the caboose and bunks so clean.\r\n\r\nIt was properly the brakeman's business to keep the car clean, but when\r\nRay got back to the depot, Giddy was nowhere to be found. Muttering that\r\nall his brakemen seemed to consider him \"easy,\" Ray went down to his car\r\nalone. He built a fire in the stove and put water on to heat while he\r\ngot into his overalls and jumper. Then he set to work with a\r\nscrubbing-brush and plenty of soap and \"cleaner.\" He scrubbed the floor\r\nand seats, blacked the stove, put clean sheets on the bunks, and then\r\nbegan to demolish Giddy's picture gallery. Ray found that his brakemen\r\nwere likely to have what he termed \"a taste for the nude in art,\" and\r\nGiddy was no exception. Ray took down half a dozen girls in tights and\r\nballet skirts,--premiums for cigarette coupons,--and some racy calendars\r\nadvertising saloons and sporting clubs, which had cost Giddy both time\r\nand trouble; he even removed Giddy's particular pet, a naked girl lying\r\non a couch with her knee carelessly poised in the air. Underneath the\r\npicture was printed the title, \"The Odalisque.\" Giddy was under the\r\nhappy delusion that this title meant something wicked,--there was a\r\nwicked look about the consonants,--but Ray, of course, had looked it up,\r\nand Giddy was indebted to the dictionary for the privilege of keeping\r\nhis lady. If \"odalisque\" had been what Ray called an objectionable word,\r\nhe would have thrown the picture out in the first place. Ray even took\r\ndown a picture of Mrs. Langtry in evening dress, because it was entitled\r\nthe \"Jersey Lily,\" and because there was a small head of Edward VII,\r\nthen Prince of Wales, in one corner. Albert Edward's conduct was a\r\npopular subject of discussion among railroad men in those days, and as\r\nRay pulled the tacks out of this lithograph he felt more indignant with\r\nthe English than ever. He deposited all these pictures under the\r\nmattress of Giddy's bunk, and stood admiring his clean car in the\r\nlamplight; the walls now exhibited only a wheatfield, advertising\r\nagricultural implements, a map of Colorado, and some pictures of\r\nrace-horses and hunting-dogs. At this moment Giddy, freshly shaved and\r\nshampooed, his shirt shining with the highest polish known to Chinese\r\nlaundrymen, his straw hat tipped over his right eye, thrust his head in\r\nat the door.\r\n\r\n\"What in hell--\" he brought out furiously. His good humored, sunburned\r\nface seemed fairly to swell with amazement and anger.\r\n\r\n\"That's all right, Giddy,\" Ray called in a conciliatory tone. \"Nothing\r\ninjured. I'll put 'em all up again as I found 'em. Going to take some\r\nladies down in the car to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nGiddy scowled. He did not dispute the propriety of Ray's measures, if\r\nthere were to be ladies on board, but he felt injured. \"I suppose you'll\r\nexpect me to behave like a Y.M.C.A. secretary,\" he growled. \"I can't do\r\nmy work and serve tea at the same time.\"\r\n\r\n\"No need to have a tea-party,\" said Ray with determined cheerfulness.\r\n\"Mrs. Kronborg will bring the lunch, and it will be a darned good one.\"\r\n\r\nGiddy lounged against the car, holding his cigar between two thick\r\nfingers. \"Then I guess she'll get it,\" he observed knowingly. \"I don't\r\nthink your musical friend is much on the grub-box. Has to keep her hands\r\nwhite to tickle the ivories.\" Giddy had nothing against Thea, but he\r\nfelt cantankerous and wanted to get a rise out of Kennedy.\r\n\r\n\"Every man to his own job,\" Ray replied agreeably, pulling his white\r\nshirt on over his head.\r\n\r\nGiddy emitted smoke disdainfully. \"I suppose so. The man that gets her\r\nwill have to wear an apron and bake the pancakes. Well, some men like to\r\nmess about the kitchen.\" He paused, but Ray was intent on getting into\r\nhis clothes as quickly as possible. Giddy thought he could go a little\r\nfurther. \"Of course, I don't dispute your right to haul women in this\r\ncar if you want to; but personally, so far as I'm concerned, I'd a good\r\ndeal rather drink a can of tomatoes and do without the women AND their\r\nlunch. I was never much enslaved to hard-boiled eggs, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll eat 'em to-morrow, all the same.\" Ray's tone had a steely\r\nglitter as he jumped out of the car, and Giddy stood aside to let him\r\npass. He knew that Kennedy's next reply would be delivered by hand. He\r\nhad once seen Ray beat up a nasty fellow for insulting a Mexican woman\r\nwho helped about the grub-car in the work train, and his fists had\r\nworked like two steel hammers. Giddy wasn't looking for trouble.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock the next morning Ray greeted his ladies and helped them\r\ninto the car. Giddy had put on a clean shirt and yellow pig-skin gloves\r\nand was whistling his best. He considered Kennedy a fluke as a ladies'\r\nman, and if there was to be a party, the honors had to be done by some\r\none who wasn't a blacksmith at small-talk. Giddy had, as Ray\r\nsarcastically admitted, \"a local reputation as a jollier,\" and he was\r\nfluent in gallant speeches of a not too-veiled nature. He insisted that\r\nThea should take his seat in the cupola, opposite Ray's, where she could\r\nlook out over the country. Thea told him, as she clambered up, that she\r\ncared a good deal more about riding in that seat than about going to\r\nDenver. Ray was never so companionable and easy as when he sat chatting\r\nin the lookout of his little house on wheels. Good stories came to him,\r\nand interesting recollections. Thea had a great respect for the reports\r\nhe had to write out, and for the telegrams that were handed to him at\r\nstations; for all the knowledge and experience it must take to run a\r\nfreight train.\r\n\r\nGiddy, down in the car, in the pauses of his work, made himself\r\nagreeable to Mrs. Kronborg.\r\n\r\n\"It's a great rest to be where my family can't get at me, Mr. Giddy,\"\r\nshe told him. \"I thought you and Ray might have some housework here for\r\nme to look after, but I couldn't improve any on this car.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we like to keep her neat,\" returned Giddy glibly, winking up at\r\nRay's expressive back. \"If you want to see a clean ice-box, look at this\r\none. Yes, Kennedy always carries fresh cream to eat on his oatmeal. I'm\r\nnot particular. The tin cow's good enough for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Most of you boys smoke so much that all victuals taste alike to you,\"\r\nsaid Mrs. Kronborg. \"I've got no religious scruples against smoking, but\r\nI couldn't take as much interest cooking for a man that used tobacco. I\r\nguess it's all right for bachelors who have to eat round.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Kronborg took off her hat and veil and made herself comfortable.\r\nShe seldom had an opportunity to be idle, and she enjoyed it. She could\r\nsit for hours and watch the sage-hens fly up and the jack-rabbits dart\r\naway from the track, without being bored. She wore a tan bombazine\r\ndress, made very plainly, and carried a roomy, worn, mother-of-the-family\r\nhandbag.\r\n\r\nRay Kennedy always insisted that Mrs. Kronborg was \"a fine-looking\r\nlady,\" but this was not the common opinion in Moonstone. Ray had lived\r\nlong enough among the Mexicans to dislike fussiness, to feel that there\r\nwas something more attractive in ease of manner than in absentminded\r\nconcern about hairpins and dabs of lace. He had learned to think that\r\nthe way a woman stood, moved, sat in her chair, looked at you, was more\r\nimportant than the absence of wrinkles from her skirt. Ray had, indeed,\r\nsuch unusual perceptions in some directions, that one could not help\r\nwondering what he would have been if he had ever, as he said, had \"half\r\na chance.\"\r\n\r\nHe was right; Mrs. Kronborg was a fine-looking woman. She was short and\r\nsquare, but her head was a real head, not a mere jerky termination of\r\nthe body. It had some individuality apart from hats and hairpins. Her\r\nhair, Moonstone women admitted, would have been very pretty \"on anybody\r\nelse.\" Frizzy bangs were worn then, but Mrs. Kronborg always dressed her\r\nhair in the same way, parted in the middle, brushed smoothly back from\r\nher low, white forehead, pinned loosely on the back of her head in two\r\nthick braids. It was growing gray about the temples, but after the\r\nmanner of yellow hair it seemed only to have grown paler there, and had\r\ntaken on a color like that of English primroses. Her eyes were clear and\r\nuntroubled; her face smooth and calm, and, as Ray said, \"strong.\"\r\n\r\nThea and Ray, up in the sunny cupola, were laughing and talking. Ray got\r\ngreat pleasure out of seeing her face there in the little box where he\r\nso often imagined it. They were crossing a plateau where great red\r\nsandstone boulders lay about, most of them much wider at the top than at\r\nthe base, so that they looked like great toadstools.\r\n\r\n\"The sand has been blowing against them for a good many hundred years,\"\r\nRay explained, directing Thea's eyes with his gloved hand. \"You see the\r\nsand blows low, being so heavy, and cuts them out underneath. Wind and\r\nsand are pretty high-class architects. That's the principle of most of\r\nthe Cliff-Dweller remains down at Canyon de Chelly. The sandstorms had\r\ndug out big depressions in the face of a cliff, and the Indians built\r\ntheir houses back in that depression.\"\r\n\r\n\"You told me that before, Ray, and of course you know. But the geography\r\nsays their houses were cut out of the face of the living rock, and I\r\nlike that better.\"\r\n\r\nRay sniffed. \"What nonsense does get printed! It's enough to give a man\r\ndisrespect for learning. How could them Indians cut houses out of the\r\nliving rock, when they knew nothing about the art of forging metals?\"\r\nRay leaned back in his chair, swung his foot, and looked thoughtful and\r\nhappy. He was in one of his favorite fields of speculation, and nothing\r\ngave him more pleasure than talking these things over with Thea\r\nKronborg. \"I'll tell you, Thee, if those old fellows had learned to work\r\nmetals once, your ancient Egyptians and Assyrians wouldn't have beat\r\nthem very much. Whatever they did do, they did well. Their masonry's\r\nstanding there to-day, the corners as true as the Denver Capitol. They\r\nwere clever at most everything but metals; and that one failure kept\r\nthem from getting across. It was the quicksand that swallowed 'em up, as\r\na race. I guess civilization proper began when men mastered metals.\"\r\n\r\nRay was not vain about his bookish phrases. He did not use them to show\r\noff, but because they seemed to him more adequate than colloquial\r\nspeech. He felt strongly about these things, and groped for words, as he\r\nsaid, \"to express himself.\" He had the lamentable American belief that\r\n\"expression\" is obligatory. He still carried in his trunk, among the\r\nunrelated possessions of a railroad man, a notebook on the title-page of\r\nwhich was written \"Impressions on First Viewing the Grand Canyon, Ray H.\r\nKennedy.\" The pages of that book were like a battlefield; the laboring\r\nauthor had fallen back from metaphor after metaphor, abandoned position\r\nafter position. He would have admitted that the art of forging metals\r\nwas nothing to this treacherous business of recording impressions, in\r\nwhich the material you were so full of vanished mysteriously under your\r\nstriving hand. \"Escaping steam!\" he had said to himself, the last time\r\nhe tried to read that notebook.\r\n\r\nThea didn't mind Ray's travel-lecture expressions. She dodged them,\r\nunconsciously, as she did her father's professional palaver. The light\r\nin Ray's pale-blue eyes and the feeling in his voice more than made up\r\nfor the stiffness of his language.\r\n\r\n\"Were the Cliff-Dwellers really clever with their hands, Ray, or do you\r\nalways have to make allowance and say, 'That was pretty good for an\r\nIndian'?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nRay went down into the car to give some instructions to Giddy. \"Well,\"\r\nhe said when he returned, \"about the aborigines: once or twice I've been\r\nwith some fellows who were cracking burial mounds. Always felt a little\r\nashamed of it, but we did pull out some remarkable things. We got some\r\npottery out whole; seemed pretty fine to me. I guess their women were\r\ntheir artists. We found lots of old shoes and sandals made out of yucca\r\nfiber, neat and strong; and feather blankets, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Feather blankets? You never told me about them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't I? The old fellows--or the squaws--wove a close netting of yucca\r\nfiber, and then tied on little bunches of down feathers, overlapping,\r\njust the way feathers grow on a bird. Some of them were feathered on\r\nboth sides. You can't get anything warmer than that, now, can you?--or\r\nprettier. What I like about those old aborigines is, that they got all\r\ntheir ideas from nature.\"\r\n\r\nThea laughed. \"That means you're going to say something about girls'\r\nwearing corsets. But some of your Indians flattened their babies' heads,\r\nand that's worse than wearing corsets.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me an Indian girl's figure for beauty,\" Ray insisted. \"And a girl\r\nwith a voice like yours ought to have plenty of lung-action. But you\r\nknow my sentiments on that subject. I was going to tell you about the\r\nhandsomest thing we ever looted out of those burial mounds. It was on a\r\nwoman, too, I regret to say. She was preserved as perfect as any mummy\r\nthat ever came out of the pyramids. She had a big string of turquoises\r\naround her neck, and she was wrapped in a fox-fur cloak, lined with\r\nlittle yellow feathers that must have come off wild canaries. Can you\r\nbeat that, now? The fellow that claimed it sold it to a Boston man for a\r\nhundred and fifty dollars.\"\r\n\r\nThea looked at him admiringly. \"Oh, Ray, and didn't you get anything off\r\nher, to remember her by, even? She must have been a princess.\"\r\n\r\nRay took a wallet from the pocket of the coat that was hanging beside\r\nhim, and drew from it a little lump wrapped in worn tissue paper. In a\r\nmoment a stone, soft and blue as a robin's egg, lay in the hard palm of\r\nhis hand. It was a turquoise, rubbed smooth in the Indian finish, which\r\nis so much more beautiful than the incongruous high polish the white man\r\ngives that tender stone. \"I got this from her necklace. See the hole\r\nwhere the string went through? You know how the Indians drill them? Work\r\nthe drill with their teeth. You like it, don't you? They're just right\r\nfor you. Blue and yellow are the Swedish colors.\" Ray looked intently at\r\nher head, bent over his hand, and then gave his whole attention to the\r\ntrack.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you, Thee,\" he began after a pause, \"I'm going to form a\r\ncamping party one of these days and persuade your PADRE to take you and\r\nyour mother down to that country, and we'll live in the rock\r\nhouses--they're as comfortable as can be--and start the cook fires up in\r\n'em once again. I'll go into the burial mounds and get you more\r\nkeepsakes than any girl ever had before.\" Ray had planned such an\r\nexpedition for his wedding journey, and it made his heart thump to see\r\nhow Thea's eyes kindled when he talked about it. \"I've learned more down\r\nthere about what makes history,\" he went on, \"than in all the books I've\r\never read. When you sit in the sun and let your heels hang out of a\r\ndoorway that drops a thousand feet, ideas come to you. You begin to feel\r\nwhat the human race has been up against from the beginning. There's\r\nsomething mighty elevating about those old habitations. You feel like\r\nit's up to you to do your best, on account of those fellows having it so\r\nhard. You feel like you owed them something.\"\r\n\r\nAt Wassiwappa, Ray got instructions to sidetrack until Thirty-six went\r\nby. After reading the message, he turned to his guests. \"I'm afraid this\r\nwill hold us up about two hours, Mrs. Kronborg, and we won't get into\r\nDenver till near midnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"That won't trouble me,\" said Mrs. Kronborg contentedly. \"They know me\r\nat the Y.W.C.A., and they'll let me in any time of night. I came to see\r\nthe country, not to make time. I've always wanted to get out at this\r\nwhite place and look around, and now I'll have a chance. What makes it\r\nso white?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some kind of chalky rock.\" Ray sprang to the ground and gave Mrs.\r\nKronborg his hand. \"You can get soil of any color in Colorado; match\r\nmost any ribbon.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Ray was getting his train on to a side track, Mrs. Kronborg\r\nstrolled off to examine the post-office and station house; these, with\r\nthe water tank, made up the town. The station agent \"batched\" and raised\r\nchickens. He ran out to meet Mrs. Kronborg, clutched at her feverishly,\r\nand began telling her at once how lonely he was and what bad luck he was\r\nhaving with his poultry. She went to his chicken yard with him, and\r\nprescribed for gapes.\r\n\r\nWassiwappa seemed a dreary place enough to people who looked for\r\nverdure, a brilliant place to people who liked color. Beside the station\r\nhouse there was a blue-grass plot, protected by a red plank fence, and\r\nsix fly-bitten box-elder trees, not much larger than bushes, were kept\r\nalive by frequent hosings from the water plug. Over the windows some\r\ndusty morning-glory vines were trained on strings. All the country about\r\nwas broken up into low chalky hills, which were so intensely white, and\r\nspotted so evenly with sage, that they looked like white leopards\r\ncrouching. White dust powdered everything, and the light was so intense\r\nthat the station agent usually wore blue glasses. Behind the station\r\nthere was a water course, which roared in flood time, and a basin in the\r\nsoft white rock where a pool of alkali water flashed in the sun like a\r\nmirror. The agent looked almost as sick as his chickens, and Mrs.\r\nKronborg at once invited him to lunch with her party. He had, he\r\nconfessed, a distaste for his own cooking, and lived mainly on soda\r\ncrackers and canned beef. He laughed apologetically when Mrs. Kronborg\r\nsaid she guessed she'd look about for a shady place to eat lunch.\r\n\r\nShe walked up the track to the water tank, and there, in the narrow\r\nshadows cast by the uprights on which the tank stood, she found two\r\ntramps. They sat up and stared at her, heavy with sleep. When she asked\r\nthem where they were going, they told her \"to the coast.\" They rested by\r\nday and traveled by night; walked the ties unless they could steal a\r\nride, they said; adding that \"these Western roads were getting strict.\"\r\nTheir faces were blistered, their eyes blood-shot, and their shoes\r\nlooked fit only for the trash pile.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you're hungry?\" Mrs. Kronborg asked. \"I suppose you both\r\ndrink?\" she went on thoughtfully, not censoriously.\r\n\r\nThe huskier of the two hoboes, a bushy, bearded fellow, rolled his eyes\r\nand said, \"I wonder?\" But the other, who was old and spare, with a sharp\r\nnose and watery eyes, sighed. \"Some has one affliction, some another,\"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kronborg reflected. \"Well,\" she said at last, \"you can't get liquor\r\nhere, anyway. I am going to ask you to vacate, because I want to have a\r\nlittle picnic under this tank for the freight crew that brought me\r\nalong. I wish I had lunch enough to provide you, but I ain't. The\r\nstation agent says he gets his provisions over there at the post office\r\nstore, and if you are hungry you can get some canned stuff there.\" She\r\nopened her handbag and gave each of the tramps a half-dollar.\r\n\r\nThe old man wiped his eyes with his forefinger. \"Thank 'ee, ma'am. A can\r\nof tomatters will taste pretty good to me. I wasn't always walkin' ties;\r\nI had a good job in Cleveland before--\"\r\n\r\nThe hairy tramp turned on him fiercely. \"Aw, shut up on that, grandpaw!\r\nAin't you got no gratitude? What do you want to hand the lady that fur?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man hung his head and turned away. As he went off, his comrade\r\nlooked after him and said to Mrs. Kronborg: \"It's true, what he says. He\r\nhad a job in the car shops; but he had bad luck.\" They both limped away\r\ntoward the store, and Mrs. Kronborg sighed. She was not afraid of\r\ntramps. She always talked to them, and never turned one away. She hated\r\nto think how many of them there were, crawling along the tracks over\r\nthat vast country.\r\n\r\nHer reflections were cut short by Ray and Giddy and Thea, who came\r\nbringing the lunch box and water bottles. Although there was not shadow\r\nenough to accommodate all the party at once, the air under the tank was\r\ndistinctly cooler than the surrounding air, and the drip made a pleasant\r\nsound in that breathless noon. The station agent ate as if he had never\r\nbeen fed before, apologizing every time he took another piece of fried\r\nchicken. Giddy was unabashed before the devilled eggs of which he had\r\nspoken so scornfully last night. After lunch the men lit their pipes and\r\nlay back against the uprights that supported the tank.\r\n\r\n\"This is the sunny side of railroading, all right,\" Giddy drawled\r\nluxuriously.\r\n\r\n\"You fellows grumble too much,\" said Mrs. Kronborg as she corked the\r\npickle jar. \"Your job has its drawbacks, but it don't tie you down. Of\r\ncourse there's the risk; but I believe a man's watched over, and he\r\ncan't be hurt on the railroad or anywhere else if it's intended he\r\nshouldn't be.\"\r\n\r\nGiddy laughed. \"Then the trains must be operated by fellows the Lord has\r\nit in for, Mrs. Kronborg. They figure it out that a railroad man's only\r\ndue to last eleven years; then it's his turn to be smashed.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a dark Providence, I don't deny,\" Mrs. Kronborg admitted. \"But\r\nthere's lots of things in life that's hard to understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess!\" murmured Giddy, looking off at the spotted white hills.\r\n\r\nRay smoked in silence, watching Thea and her mother clear away the\r\nlunch. He was thinking that Mrs. Kronborg had in her face the same\r\nserious look that Thea had; only hers was calm and satisfied, and Thea's\r\nwas intense and questioning. But in both it was a large kind of look,\r\nthat was not all the time being broken up and convulsed by trivial\r\nthings. They both carried their heads like Indian women, with a kind of\r\nnoble unconsciousness. He got so tired of women who were always nodding\r\nand jerking; apologizing, deprecating, coaxing, insinuating with their\r\nheads.\r\n\r\nWhen Ray's party set off again that afternoon the sun beat fiercely into\r\nthe cupola, and Thea curled up in one of the seats at the back of the\r\ncar and had a nap.\r\n\r\nAs the short twilight came on, Giddy took a turn in the cupola, and Ray\r\ncame down and sat with Thea on the rear platform of the caboose and\r\nwatched the darkness come in soft waves over the plain. They were now\r\nabout thirty miles from Denver, and the mountains looked very near. The\r\ngreat toothed wall behind which the sun had gone down now separated into\r\nfour distinct ranges, one behind the other. They were a very pale blue,\r\na color scarcely stronger than wood smoke, and the sunset had left\r\nbright streaks in the snow-filled gorges. In the clear, yellow-streaked\r\nsky the stars were coming out, flickering like newly lighted lamps,\r\ngrowing steadier and more golden as the sky darkened and the land\r\nbeneath them fell into complete shadow. It was a cool, restful darkness\r\nthat was not black or forbidding, but somehow open and free; the night\r\nof high plains where there is no moistness or mistiness in the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nRay lit his pipe. \"I never get tired of them old stars, Thee. I miss 'em\r\nup in Washington and Oregon where it's misty. Like 'em best down in\r\nMother Mexico, where they have everything their own way. I'm not for any\r\ncountry where the stars are dim.\" Ray paused and drew on his pipe. \"I\r\ndon't know as I ever really noticed 'em much till that first year I\r\nherded sheep up in Wyoming. That was the year the blizzard caught me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you lost all your sheep, didn't you, Ray?\" Thea spoke\r\nsympathetically. \"Was the man who owned them nice about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he was a good loser. But I didn't get over it for a long while.\r\nSheep are so damned resigned. Sometimes, to this day, when I'm\r\ndog-tired, I try to save them sheep all night long. It comes kind of\r\nhard on a boy when he first finds out how little he is, and how big\r\neverything else is.\"\r\n\r\nThea moved restlessly toward him and dropped her chin on her hand,\r\nlooking at a low star that seemed to rest just on the rim of the earth.\r\n\"I don't see how you stood it. I don't believe I could. I don't see how\r\npeople can stand it to get knocked out, anyhow!\" She spoke with such\r\nfierceness that Ray glanced at her in surprise. She was sitting on the\r\nfloor of the car, crouching like a little animal about to spring.\r\n\r\n\"No occasion for you to see,\" he said warmly. \"There'll always be plenty\r\nof other people to take the knocks for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's nonsense, Ray.\" Thea spoke impatiently and leaned lower still,\r\nfrowning at the red star. \"Everybody's up against it for himself,\r\nsucceeds or fails--himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"In one way, yes,\" Ray admitted, knocking the sparks from his pipe out\r\ninto the soft darkness that seemed to flow like a river beside the car.\r\n\"But when you look at it another way, there are a lot of halfway people\r\nin this world who help the winners win, and the failers fail. If a man\r\nstumbles, there's plenty of people to push him down. But if he's like\r\n'the youth who bore,' those same people are foreordained to help him\r\nalong. They may hate to, worse than blazes, and they may do a lot of\r\ncussin' about it, but they have to help the winners and they can't dodge\r\nit. It's a natural law, like what keeps the big clock up there going,\r\nlittle wheels and big, and no mix-up.\" Ray's hand and his pipe were\r\nsuddenly outlined against the sky. \"Ever occur to you, Thee, that they\r\nhave to be on time close enough to MAKE TIME? The Dispatcher up there\r\nmust have a long head.\" Pleased with his similitude, Ray went back to\r\nthe lookout. Going into Denver, he had to keep a sharp watch.\r\n\r\nGiddy came down, cheerful at the prospect of getting into port, and\r\nsinging a new topical ditty that had come up from the Santa Fe by way of\r\nLa Junta. Nobody knows who makes these songs; they seem to follow events\r\nautomatically. Mrs. Kronborg made Giddy sing the whole twelve verses of\r\nthis one, and laughed until she wiped her eyes. The story was that of\r\nKatie Casey, head diningroom girl at Winslow, Arizona, who was unjustly\r\ndischarged by the Harvey House manager. Her suitor, the yardmaster, took\r\nthe switchmen out on a strike until she was reinstated. Freight trains\r\nfrom the east and the west piled up at Winslow until the yards looked\r\nlike a log-jam. The division superintendent, who was in California, had\r\nto wire instructions for Katie Casey's restoration before he could get\r\nhis trains running. Giddy's song told all this with much detail, both\r\ntender and technical, and after each of the dozen verses came the\r\nrefrain:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Oh, who would think that Katie Casey owned the Santa Fe?\r\n     But it really looks that way,\r\n     The dispatcher's turnin' gray,\r\n     All the crews is off their pay;\r\n     She can hold the freight from Albuquerq' to Needles any day;\r\n     The division superintendent, he come home from Monterey,\r\n     Just to see if things was pleasin' Katie Ca--a--a--sey.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThea laughed with her mother and applauded Giddy. Everything was so\r\nkindly and comfortable; Giddy and Ray, and their hospitable little\r\nhouse, and the easy-going country, and the stars.  She curled up on the\r\nseat again with that warm, sleepy feeling of the friendliness of the\r\nworld--which nobody keeps very long, and which she was to lose early and\r\nirrevocably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nThe summer flew by. Thea was glad when Ray Kennedy had a Sunday in town\r\nand could take her driving. Out among the sand hills she could forget\r\nthe \"new room\" which was the scene of wearing and fruitless labor. Dr.\r\nArchie was away from home a good deal that year. He had put all his\r\nmoney into mines above Colorado Springs, and he hoped for great returns\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of that year, Mr. Kronborg decided that Thea ought to show\r\nmore interest in church work. He put it to her frankly, one night at\r\nsupper, before the whole family. \"How can I insist on the other girls in\r\nthe congregation being active in the work, when one of my own daughters\r\nmanifests so little interest?\"\r\n\r\n\"But I sing every Sunday morning, and I have to give up one night a week\r\nto choir practice,\" Thea declared rebelliously, pushing back her plate\r\nwith an angry determination to eat nothing more.\r\n\r\n\"One night a week is not enough for the pastor's daughter,\" her father\r\nreplied. \"You won't do anything in the sewing society, and you won't\r\ntake part in the Christian Endeavor or the Band of Hope. Very well, you\r\nmust make it up in other ways. I want some one to play the organ and\r\nlead the singing at prayer-meeting this winter. Deacon Potter told me\r\nsome time ago that he thought there would be more interest in our\r\nprayer-meetings if we had the organ. Miss Meyers don't feel that she can\r\nplay on Wednesday nights. And there ought to be somebody to start the\r\nhymns. Mrs. Potter is getting old, and she always starts them too high.\r\nIt won't take much of your time, and it will keep people from talking.\"\r\n\r\nThis argument conquered Thea, though she left the table sullenly. The\r\nfear of the tongue, that terror of little towns, is usually felt more\r\nkeenly by the minister's family than by other households. Whenever the\r\nKronborgs wanted to do anything, even to buy a new carpet, they had to\r\ntake counsel together as to whether people would talk. Mrs. Kronborg had\r\nher own conviction that people talked when they felt like it, and said\r\nwhat they chose, no matter how the minister's family conducted\r\nthemselves. But she did not impart these dangerous ideas to her\r\nchildren. Thea was still under the belief that public opinion could be\r\nplacated; that if you clucked often enough, the hens would mistake you\r\nfor one of themselves.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kronborg did not have any particular zest for prayer-meetings, and\r\nshe stayed at home whenever she had a valid excuse. Thor was too old to\r\nfurnish such an excuse now, so every Wednesday night, unless one of the\r\nchildren was sick, she trudged off with Thea, behind Mr. Kronborg. At\r\nfirst Thea was terribly bored. But she got used to prayer-meeting, got\r\neven to feel a mournful interest in it.\r\n\r\nThe exercises were always pretty much the same. After the first hymn her\r\nfather read a passage from the Bible, usually a Psalm. Then there was\r\nanother hymn, and then her father commented upon the passage he had read\r\nand, as he said, \"applied the Word to our necessities.\" After a third\r\nhymn, the meeting was declared open, and the old men and women took\r\nturns at praying and talking. Mrs. Kronborg never spoke in meeting. She\r\ntold people firmly that she had been brought up to keep silent and let\r\nthe men talk, but she gave respectful attention to the others, sitting\r\nwith her hands folded in her lap.\r\n\r\nThe prayer-meeting audience was always small. The young and energetic\r\nmembers of the congregation came only once or twice a year, \"to keep\r\npeople from talking.\" The usual Wednesday night gathering was made up of\r\nold women, with perhaps six or eight old men, and a few sickly girls who\r\nhad not much interest in life; two of them, indeed, were already\r\npreparing to die. Thea accepted the mournfulness of the prayer-meetings\r\nas a kind of spiritual discipline, like funerals. She always read late\r\nafter she went home and felt a stronger wish than usual to live and to\r\nbe happy.\r\n\r\nThe meetings were conducted in the Sunday-School room, where there were\r\nwooden chairs instead of pews; an old map of Palestine hung on the wall,\r\nand the bracket lamps gave out only a dim light. The old women sat\r\nmotionless as Indians in their shawls and bonnets; some of them wore\r\nlong black mourning veils. The old men drooped in their chairs. Every\r\nback, every face, every head said \"resignation.\" Often there were long\r\nsilences, when you could hear nothing but the crackling of the soft coal\r\nin the stove and the muffled cough of one of the sick girls.\r\n\r\nThere was one nice old lady,--tall, erect, self-respecting, with a\r\ndelicate white face and a soft voice. She never whined, and what she\r\nsaid was always cheerful, though she spoke so nervously that Thea knew\r\nshe dreaded getting up, and that she made a real sacrifice to, as she\r\nsaid, \"testify to the goodness of her Saviour.\" She was the mother of\r\nthe girl who coughed, and Thea used to wonder how she explained things\r\nto herself. There was, indeed, only one woman who talked because she\r\nwas, as Mr. Kronborg said, \"tonguey.\" The others were somehow\r\nimpressive. They told about the sweet thoughts that came to them while\r\nthey were at their work; how, amid their household tasks, they were\r\nsuddenly lifted by the sense of a divine Presence. Sometimes they told\r\nof their first conversion, of how in their youth that higher Power had\r\nmade itself known to them. Old Mr. Carsen, the carpenter, who gave his\r\nservices as janitor to the church, used often to tell how, when he was a\r\nyoung man and a scoffer, bent on the destruction of both body and soul,\r\nhis Saviour had come to him in the Michigan woods and had stood, it\r\nseemed to him, beside the tree he was felling; and how he dropped his\r\naxe and knelt in prayer \"to Him who died for us upon the tree.\" Thea\r\nalways wanted to ask him more about it; about his mysterious wickedness,\r\nand about the vision.\r\n\r\nSometimes the old people would ask for prayers for their absent\r\nchildren. Sometimes they asked their brothers and sisters in Christ to\r\npray that they might be stronger against temptations. One of the sick\r\ngirls used to ask them to pray that she might have more faith in the\r\ntimes of depression that came to her, \"when all the way before seemed\r\ndark.\" She repeated that husky phrase so often, that Thea always\r\nremembered it.\r\n\r\nOne old woman, who never missed a Wednesday night, and who nearly always\r\ntook part in the meeting, came all the way up from the depot settlement.\r\nShe always wore a black crocheted \"fascinator\" over her thin white hair,\r\nand she made long, tremulous prayers, full of railroad terminology. She\r\nhad six sons in the service of different railroads, and she always\r\nprayed \"for the boys on the road, who know not at what moment they may\r\nbe cut off. When, in Thy divine wisdom, their hour is upon them, may\r\nthey, O our Heavenly Father, see only white lights along the road to\r\nEternity.\" She used to speak, too, of \"the engines that race with\r\ndeath\"; and though she looked so old and little when she was on her\r\nknees, and her voice was so shaky, her prayers had a thrill of speed and\r\ndanger in them; they made one think of the deep black canyons, the\r\nslender trestles, the pounding trains. Thea liked to look at her sunken\r\neyes that seemed full of wisdom, at her black thread gloves, much too\r\nlong in the fingers and so meekly folded one over the other. Her face\r\nwas brown, and worn away as rocks are worn by water. There are many ways\r\nof describing that color of age, but in reality it is not like\r\nparchment, or like any of the things it is said to be like. That\r\nbrownness and that texture of skin are found only in the faces of old\r\nhuman creatures, who have worked hard and who have always been poor.\r\n\r\nOne bitterly cold night in December the prayer-meeting seemed to Thea\r\nlonger than usual. The prayers and the talks went on and on. It was as\r\nif the old people were afraid to go out into the cold, or were stupefied\r\nby the hot air of the room. She had left a book at home that she was\r\nimpatient to get back to. At last the Doxology was sung, but the old\r\npeople lingered about the stove to greet each other, and Thea took her\r\nmother's arm and hurried out to the frozen sidewalk, before her father\r\ncould get away. The wind was whistling up the street and whipping the\r\nnaked cottonwood trees against the telegraph poles and the sides of the\r\nhouses. Thin snow clouds were flying overhead, so that the sky looked\r\ngray, with a dull phosphorescence. The icy streets and the shingle roofs\r\nof the houses were gray, too. All along the street, shutters banged or\r\nwindows rattled, or gates wobbled, held by their latch but shaking on\r\nloose hinges. There was not a cat or a dog in Moonstone that night that\r\nwas not given a warm shelter; the cats under the kitchen stove, the dogs\r\nin barns or coal-sheds. When Thea and her mother reached home, their\r\nmufflers were covered with ice, where their breath had frozen. They\r\nhurried into the house and made a dash for the parlor and the hard-coal\r\nburner, behind which Gunner was sitting on a stool, reading his Jules\r\nVerne book. The door stood open into the dining-room, which was heated\r\nfrom the parlor. Mr. Kronborg always had a lunch when he came home from\r\nprayer-meeting, and his pumpkin pie and milk were set out on the\r\ndining-table. Mrs. Kronborg said she thought she felt hungry, too, and\r\nasked Thea if she didn't want something to eat.\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm not hungry, mother. I guess I'll go upstairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"I expect you've got some book up there,\" said Mrs. Kronborg, bringing\r\nout another pie. \"You'd better bring it down here and read. Nobody'll\r\ndisturb you, and it's terrible cold up in that loft.\"\r\n\r\nThea was always assured that no one would disturb her if she read\r\ndownstairs, but the boys talked when they came in, and her father fairly\r\ndelivered discourses after he had been renewed by half a pie and a\r\npitcher of milk.\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind the cold. I'll take a hot brick up for my feet. I put one\r\nin the stove before I left, if one of the boys hasn't stolen it.\r\nGood-night, mother.\" Thea got her brick and lantern, and dashed upstairs\r\nthrough the windy loft. She undressed at top speed and got into bed with\r\nher brick. She put a pair of white knitted gloves on her hands, and\r\npinned over her head a piece of soft flannel that had been one of Thor's\r\nlong petticoats when he was a baby. Thus equipped, she was ready for\r\nbusiness. She took from her table a thick paper-backed volume, one of\r\nthe \"line\" of paper novels the druggist kept to sell to traveling men.\r\nShe had bought it, only yesterday, because the first sentence interested\r\nher very much, and because she saw, as she glanced over the pages, the\r\nmagical names of two Russian cities. The book was a poor translation of\r\n\"Anna Karenina.\" Thea opened it at a mark, and fixed her eyes intently\r\nupon the small print. The hymns, the sick girl, the resigned black\r\nfigures were forgotten. It was the night of the ball in Moscow.\r\n\r\nThea would have been astonished if she could have known how, years\r\nafterward, when she had need of them, those old faces were to come back\r\nto her, long after they were hidden away under the earth; that they\r\nwould seem to her then as full of meaning, as mysteriously marked by\r\nDestiny, as the people who danced the mazurka under the elegant\r\nKorsunsky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nMr. Kronborg was too fond of his ease and too sensible to worry his\r\nchildren much about religion. He was more sincere than many preachers,\r\nbut when he spoke to his family about matters of conduct it was usually\r\nwith a regard for keeping up appearances. The church and church work\r\nwere discussed in the family like the routine of any other business.\r\nSunday was the hard day of the week with them, just as Saturday was the\r\nbusy day with the merchants on Main Street. Revivals were seasons of\r\nextra work and pressure, just as threshing-time was on the farms.\r\nVisiting elders had to be lodged and cooked for, the folding-bed in the\r\nparlor was let down, and Mrs. Kronborg had to work in the kitchen all\r\nday long and attend the night meetings.\r\n\r\nDuring one of these revivals Thea's sister Anna professed religion with,\r\nas Mrs. Kronborg said, \"a good deal of fluster.\" While Anna was going up\r\nto the mourners' bench nightly and asking for the prayers of the\r\ncongregation, she disseminated general gloom throughout the household,\r\nand after she joined the church she took on an air of \"set-apartness\"\r\nthat was extremely trying to her brothers and her sister, though they\r\nrealized that Anna's sanctimoniousness was perhaps a good thing for\r\ntheir father. A preacher ought to have one child who did more than\r\nmerely acquiesce in religious observances, and Thea and the boys were\r\nglad enough that it was Anna and not one of themselves who assumed this\r\nobligation.\r\n\r\n\"Anna, she's American,\" Mrs. Kronborg used to say. The Scandinavian\r\nmould of countenance, more or less marked in each of the other children,\r\nwas scarcely discernible in her, and she looked enough like other\r\nMoonstone girls to be thought pretty. Anna's nature was conventional, like\r\nher face. Her position as the minister's eldest daughter was important\r\nto her, and she tried to live up to it. She read sentimental religious\r\nstory-books and emulated the spiritual struggles and magnanimous\r\nbehavior of their persecuted heroines. Everything had to be interpreted\r\nfor Anna. Her opinions about the smallest and most commonplace things\r\nwere gleaned from the Denver papers, the church weeklies, from sermons\r\nand Sunday-School addresses. Scarcely anything was attractive to her in\r\nits natural state--indeed, scarcely anything was decent until it was\r\nclothed by the opinion of some authority. Her ideas about habit,\r\ncharacter, duty, love, marriage, were grouped under heads, like a book\r\nof popular quotations, and were totally unrelated to the emergencies of\r\nhuman living. She discussed all these subjects with other Methodist\r\ngirls of her age. They would spend hours, for instance, in deciding what\r\nthey would or would not tolerate in a suitor or a husband, and the\r\nfrailties of masculine nature were too often a subject of discussion\r\namong them. In her behavior Anna was a harmless girl, mild except where\r\nher prejudices were concerned, neat and industrious, with no graver\r\nfault than priggishness; but her mind had really shocking habits of\r\nclassification. The wickedness of Denver and of Chicago, and even of\r\nMoonstone, occupied her thoughts too much. She had none of the delicacy\r\nthat goes with a nature of warm impulses, but the kind of fishy\r\ncuriosity which justifies itself by an expression of horror.\r\n\r\nThea, and all Thea's ways and friends, seemed indecorous to Anna. She\r\nnot only felt a grave social discrimination against the Mexicans; she\r\ncould not forget that Spanish Johnny was a drunkard and that \"nobody\r\nknew what he did when he ran away from home.\" Thea pretended, of course,\r\nthat she liked the Mexicans because they were fond of music; but every\r\none knew that music was nothing very real, and that it did not matter in\r\na girl's relations with people. What was real, then, and what did\r\nmatter? Poor Anna!\r\n\r\nAnna approved of Ray Kennedy as a young man of steady habits and\r\nblameless life, but she regretted that he was an atheist, and that he\r\nwas not a passenger conductor with brass buttons on his coat. On the\r\nwhole, she wondered what such an exemplary young man found to like in\r\nThea. Dr. Archie she treated respectfully because of his position in\r\nMoonstone, but she KNEW he had kissed the Mexican barytone's pretty\r\ndaughter, and she had a whole DOSSIER of evidence about his behavior in\r\nhis hours of relaxation in Denver. He was \"fast,\" and it was because he\r\nwas \"fast\" that Thea liked him. Thea always liked that kind of people.\r\nDr. Archie's whole manner with Thea, Anna often told her mother, was too\r\nfree. He was always putting his hand on Thea's head, or holding her hand\r\nwhile he laughed and looked down at her. The kindlier manifestation of\r\nhuman nature (about which Anna sang and talked, in the interests of\r\nwhich she went to conventions and wore white ribbons) were never\r\nrealities to her after all. She did not believe in them. It was only in\r\nattitudes of protest or reproof, clinging to the cross, that human\r\nbeings could be even temporarily decent.\r\n\r\nPreacher Kronborg's secret convictions were very much like Anna's. He\r\nbelieved that his wife was absolutely good, but there was not a man or\r\nwoman in his congregation whom he trusted all the way.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kronborg, on the other hand, was likely to find something to admire\r\nin almost any human conduct that was positive and energetic. She could\r\nalways be taken in by the stories of tramps and runaway boys. She went\r\nto the circus and admired the bareback riders, who were \"likely good\r\nenough women in their way.\" She admired Dr. Archie's fine physique and\r\nwell-cut clothes as much as Thea did, and said she \"felt it was a\r\nprivilege to be handled by such a gentleman when she was sick.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after Anna became a church member she began to remonstrate with\r\nThea about practicing--playing \"secular music\"--on Sunday. One Sunday\r\nthe dispute in the parlor grew warm and was carried to Mrs. Kronborg in\r\nthe kitchen. She listened judicially and told Anna to read the chapter\r\nabout how Naaman the leper was permitted to bow down in the house of\r\nRimmon. Thea went back to the piano, and Anna lingered to say that,\r\nsince she was in the right, her mother should have supported her.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mrs. Kronborg, rather indifferently, \"I can't see it that\r\nway, Anna. I never forced you to practice, and I don't see as I should\r\nkeep Thea from it. I like to hear her, and I guess your father does. You\r\nand Thea will likely follow different lines, and I don't see as I'm\r\ncalled upon to bring you up alike.\"\r\n\r\nAnna looked meek and abused. \"Of course all the church people must hear\r\nher. Ours is the only noisy house on this street. You hear what she's\r\nplaying now, don't you?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Kronborg rose from browning her coffee. \"Yes; it's the Blue Danube\r\nwaltzes. I'm familiar with 'em. If any of the church people come at you,\r\nyou just send 'em to me. I ain't afraid to speak out on occasion, and I\r\nwouldn't mind one bit telling the Ladies' Aid a few things about\r\nstandard composers.\" Mrs. Kronborg smiled, and added thoughtfully, \"No,\r\nI wouldn't mind that one bit.\"\r\n\r\nAnna went about with a reserved and distant air for a week, and Mrs.\r\nKronborg suspected that she held a larger place than usual in her\r\ndaughter's prayers; but that was another thing she didn't mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough revivals were merely a part of the year's work, like\r\nexamination week at school, and although Anna's piety impressed her very\r\nlittle, a time came when Thea was perplexed about religion. A scourge of\r\ntyphoid broke out in Moonstone and several of Thea's schoolmates died of\r\nit. She went to their funerals, saw them put into the ground, and\r\nwondered a good deal about them. But a certain grim incident, which\r\ncaused the epidemic, troubled her even more than the death of her\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nEarly in July, soon after Thea's fifteenth birthday, a particularly\r\ndisgusting sort of tramp came into Moonstone in an empty box car. Thea\r\nwas sitting in the hammock in the front yard when he first crawled up to\r\nthe town from the depot, carrying a bundle wrapped in dirty ticking\r\nunder one arm, and under the other a wooden box with rusty screening\r\nnailed over one end. He had a thin, hungry face covered with black hair.\r\nIt was just before suppertime when he came along, and the street smelled\r\nof fried potatoes and fried onions and coffee. Thea saw him sniffing the\r\nair greedily and walking slower and slower. He looked over the fence.\r\nShe hoped he would not stop at their gate, for her mother never turned\r\nany one away, and this was the dirtiest and most utterly\r\nwretched-looking tramp she had ever seen. There was a terrible odor\r\nabout him, too. She caught it even at that distance, and put her\r\nhandkerchief to her nose. A moment later she was sorry, for she knew\r\nthat he had noticed it. He looked away and shuffled a little faster.\r\n\r\nA few days later Thea heard that the tramp had camped in an empty shack\r\nover on the east edge of town, beside the ravine, and was trying to give\r\na miserable sort of show there. He told the boys who went to see what he\r\nwas doing, that he had traveled with a circus. His bundle contained a\r\nfilthy clown's suit, and his box held half a dozen rattlesnakes.\r\n\r\nSaturday night, when Thea went to the butcher shop to get the chickens\r\nfor Sunday, she heard the whine of an accordion and saw a crowd before\r\none of the saloons. There she found the tramp, his bony body grotesquely\r\nattired in the clown's suit, his face shaved and painted white,--the\r\nsweat trickling through the paint and washing it away,--and his eyes\r\nwild and feverish. Pulling the accordion in and out seemed to be almost\r\ntoo great an effort for him, and he panted to the tune of \"Marching\r\nthrough Georgia.\" After a considerable crowd had gathered, the tramp\r\nexhibited his box of snakes, announced that he would now pass the hat,\r\nand that when the onlookers had contributed the sum of one dollar, he\r\nwould eat \"one of these living reptiles.\" The crowd began to cough and\r\nmurmur, and the saloon keeper rushed off for the marshal, who arrested\r\nthe wretch for giving a show without a license and hurried him away to\r\nthe calaboose.\r\n\r\nThe calaboose stood in a sunflower patch,--an old hut with a barred\r\nwindow and a padlock on the door. The tramp was utterly filthy and there\r\nwas no way to give him a bath. The law made no provision to grub-stake\r\nvagrants, so after the constable had detained the tramp for twentyfour\r\nhours, he released him and told him to \"get out of town, and get quick.\"\r\nThe fellow's rattlesnakes had been killed by the saloon keeper. He hid\r\nin a box car in the freight yard, probably hoping to get a ride to the\r\nnext station, but he was found and put out. After that he was seen no\r\nmore. He had disappeared and left no trace except an ugly, stupid word,\r\nchalked on the black paint of the seventy-five-foot standpipe which was\r\nthe reservoir for the Moonstone water-supply; the same word, in another\r\ntongue, that the French soldier shouted at Waterloo to the English\r\nofficer who bade the Old Guard surrender; a comment on life which the\r\ndefeated, along the hard roads of the world, sometimes bawl at the\r\nvictorious.\r\n\r\nA week after the tramp excitement had passed over, the city water began\r\nto smell and to taste. The Kronborgs had a well in their back yard and\r\ndid not use city water, but they heard the complaints of their\r\nneighbors. At first people said that the town well was full of rotting\r\ncottonwood roots, but the engineer at the pumping-station convinced the\r\nmayor that the water left the well untainted. Mayors reason slowly, but,\r\nthe well being eliminated, the official mind had to travel toward the\r\nstandpipe--there was no other track for it to go in. The standpipe amply\r\nrewarded investigation. The tramp had got even with Moonstone. He had\r\nclimbed the standpipe by the handholds and let himself down into\r\nseventy-five feet of cold water, with his shoes and hat and roll of\r\nticking. The city council had a mild panic and passed a new ordinance\r\nabout tramps. But the fever had already broken out, and several adults\r\nand half a dozen children died of it.\r\n\r\nThea had always found everything that happened in Moonstone exciting,\r\ndisasters particularly so. It was gratifying to read sensational\r\nMoonstone items in the Denver paper. But she wished she had not chanced\r\nto see the tramp as he came into town that evening, sniffing the\r\nsupper-laden air. His face remained unpleasantly clear in her memory,\r\nand her mind struggled with the problem of his behavior as if it were a\r\nhard page in arithmetic. Even when she was practicing, the drama of the\r\ntramp kept going on in the back of her head, and she was constantly\r\ntrying to make herself realize what pitch of hatred or despair could\r\ndrive a man to do such a hideous thing. She kept seeing him in his\r\nbedraggled clown suit, the white paint on his roughly shaven face,\r\nplaying his accordion before the saloon. She had noticed his lean body,\r\nhis high, bald forehead that sloped back like a curved metal lid. How\r\ncould people fall so far out of fortune? She tried to talk to Ray\r\nKennedy about her perplexity, but Ray would not discuss things of that\r\nsort with her. It was in his sentimental conception of women that they\r\nshould be deeply religious, though men were at liberty to doubt and\r\nfinally to deny. A picture called \"The Soul Awakened,\" popular in\r\nMoonstone parlors, pretty well interpreted Ray's idea of woman's\r\nspiritual nature.\r\n\r\nOne evening when she was haunted by the figure of the tramp, Thea went\r\nup to Dr. Archie's office. She found him sewing up two bad gashes in the\r\nface of a little boy who had been kicked by a mule. After the boy had\r\nbeen bandaged and sent away with his father, Thea helped the doctor wash\r\nand put away the surgical instruments. Then she dropped into her\r\naccustomed seat beside his desk and began to talk about the tramp. Her\r\neyes were hard and green with excitement, the doctor noticed.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me, Dr. Archie, that the whole town's to blame. I'm to\r\nblame, myself. I know he saw me hold my nose when he went by. Father's\r\nto blame. If he believes the Bible, he ought to have gone to the\r\ncalaboose and cleaned that man up and taken care of him. That's what I\r\ncan't understand; do people believe the Bible, or don't they? If the\r\nnext life is all that matters, and we're put here to get ready for it,\r\nthen why do we try to make money, or learn things, or have a good time?\r\nThere's not one person in Moonstone that really lives the way the New\r\nTestament says. Does it matter, or don't it?\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie swung round in his chair and looked at her, honestly and\r\nleniently. \"Well, Thea, it seems to me like this. Every people has had\r\nits religion. All religions are good, and all are pretty much alike. But\r\nI don't see how we could live up to them in the sense you mean. I've\r\nthought about it a good deal, and I can't help feeling that while we are\r\nin this world we have to live for the best things of this world, and\r\nthose things are material and positive. Now, most religions are passive,\r\nand they tell us chiefly what we should not do.\" The doctor moved\r\nrestlessly, and his eyes hunted for something along the opposite wall:\r\n\"See here, my girl, take out the years of early childhood and the time\r\nwe spend in sleep and dull old age, and we only have about twenty able,\r\nwaking years. That's not long enough to get acquainted with half the\r\nfine things that have been done in the world, much less to do anything\r\nourselves. I think we ought to keep the Commandments and help other\r\npeople all we can; but the main thing is to live those twenty splendid\r\nyears; to do all we can and enjoy all we can.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie met his little friend's searching gaze, the look of acute\r\ninquiry which always touched him.\r\n\r\n\"But poor fellows like that tramp--\" she hesitated and wrinkled her\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nThe doctor leaned forward and put his hand protectingly over hers, which\r\nlay clenched on the green felt desktop. \"Ugly accidents happen, Thea;\r\nalways have and always will. But the failures are swept back into the\r\npile and forgotten. They don't leave any lasting scar in the world, and\r\nthey don't affect the future. The things that last are the good things.\r\nThe people who forge ahead and do something, they really count.\" He saw\r\ntears on her cheeks, and he remembered that he had never seen her cry\r\nbefore, not even when she crushed her finger when she was little. He\r\nrose and walked to the window, came back and sat down on the edge of his\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\"Forget the tramp, Thea. This is a great big world, and I want you to\r\nget about and see it all. You're going to Chicago some day, and do\r\nsomething with that fine voice of yours. You're going to be a number one\r\nmusician and make us proud of you. Take Mary Anderson, now; even the\r\ntramps are proud of her. There isn't a tramp along the 'Q' system who\r\nhasn't heard of her. We all like people who do things, even if we only\r\nsee their faces on a cigar-box lid.\"\r\n\r\nThey had a long talk. Thea felt that Dr. Archie had never let himself\r\nout to her so much before. It was the most grown-up conversation she had\r\never had with him. She left his office happy, flattered and stimulated.\r\nShe ran for a long while about the white, moonlit streets, looking up at\r\nthe stars and the bluish night, at the quiet houses sunk in black shade,\r\nthe glittering sand hills. She loved the familiar trees, and the people\r\nin those little houses, and she loved the unknown world beyond Denver.\r\nShe felt as if she were being pulled in two, between the desire to go\r\naway forever and the desire to stay forever. She had only twenty\r\nyears--no time to lose.\r\n\r\nMany a night that summer she left Dr. Archie's office with a desire to\r\nrun and run about those quiet streets until she wore out her shoes, or\r\nwore out the streets themselves; when her chest ached and it seemed as\r\nif her heart were spreading all over the desert. When she went home, it\r\nwas not to go to sleep. She used to drag her mattress beside her low\r\nwindow and lie awake for a long while, vibrating with excitement, as a\r\nmachine vibrates from speed. Life rushed in upon her through that\r\nwindow--or so it seemed. In reality, of course, life rushes from within,\r\nnot from without. There is no work of art so big or so beautiful that it\r\nwas not once all contained in some youthful body, like this one which\r\nlay on the floor in the moonlight, pulsing with ardor and anticipation.\r\nIt was on such nights that Thea Kronborg learned the thing that old\r\nDumas meant when he told the Romanticists that to make a drama he needed\r\nbut one passion and four walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nIt is well for its peace of mind that the traveling public takes\r\nrailroads so much for granted. The only men who are incurably nervous\r\nabout railway travel are the railroad operatives. A railroad man never\r\nforgets that the next run may be his turn.\r\n\r\nOn a single-track road, like that upon which Ray Kennedy worked, the\r\nfreight trains make their way as best they can between passenger trains.\r\nEven when there is such a thing as a freight time-schedule, it is merely\r\na form. Along the one track dozens of fast and slow trains dash in both\r\ndirections, kept from collision only by the brains in the dispatcher's\r\noffice. If one passenger train is late, the whole schedule must be\r\nrevised in an instant; the trains following must be warned, and those\r\nmoving toward the belated train must be assigned new meeting-places.\r\n\r\nBetween the shifts and modifications of the passenger schedule, the\r\nfreight trains play a game of their own. They have no right to the track\r\nat any given time, but are supposed to be on it when it is free, and to\r\nmake the best time they can between passenger trains. A freight train,\r\non a single-track road, gets anywhere at all only by stealing bases.\r\n\r\nRay Kennedy had stuck to the freight service, although he had had\r\nopportunities to go into the passenger service at higher pay. He always\r\nregarded railroading as a temporary makeshift, until he \"got into\r\nsomething,\" and he disliked the passenger service. No brass buttons for\r\nhim, he said; too much like a livery. While he was railroading he would\r\nwear a jumper, thank you!\r\n\r\nThe wreck that \"caught\" Ray was a very commonplace one; nothing\r\nthrilling about it, and it got only six lines in the Denver papers. It\r\nhappened about daybreak one morning, only thirty-two miles from home.\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock in the morning Ray's train had stopped to take water at\r\nSaxony, having just rounded the long curve which lies south of that\r\nstation. It was Joe Giddy's business to walk back along the curve about\r\nthree hundred yards and put out torpedoes to warn any train which might\r\nbe coming up from behind--a freight crew is not notified of trains\r\nfollowing, and the brakeman is supposed to protect his train. Ray was so\r\nfussy about the punctilious observance of orders that almost any\r\nbrakeman would take a chance once in a while, from natural perversity.\r\n\r\nWhen the train stopped for water that morning, Ray was at the desk in\r\nhis caboose, making out his report. Giddy took his torpedoes, swung off\r\nthe rear platform, and glanced back at the curve. He decided that he\r\nwould not go back to flag this time. If anything was coming up behind,\r\nhe could hear it in plenty of time. So he ran forward to look after a\r\nhot journal that had been bothering him. In a general way, Giddy's\r\nreasoning was sound. If a freight train, or even a passenger train, had\r\nbeen coming up behind them, he could have heard it in time. But as it\r\nhappened, a light engine, which made no noise at all, was\r\ncoming,--ordered out to help with the freight that was piling up at the\r\nother end of the division. This engine got no warning, came round the\r\ncurve, struck the caboose, went straight through it, and crashed into\r\nthe heavy lumber car ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kronborgs were just sitting down to breakfast, when the night\r\ntelegraph operator dashed into the yard at a run and hammered on the\r\nfront door. Gunner answered the knock, and the telegraph operator told\r\nhim he wanted to see his father a minute, quick. Mr. Kronborg appeared\r\nat the door, napkin in hand. The operator was pale and panting.\r\n\r\n\"Fourteen was wrecked down at Saxony this morning,\" he shouted, \"and\r\nKennedy's all broke up. We're sending an engine down with the doctor,\r\nand the operator at Saxony says Kennedy wants you to come along with us\r\nand bring your girl.\" He stopped for breath.\r\n\r\nMr. Kronborg took off his glasses and began rubbing them with his\r\nnapkin.\r\n\r\n\"Bring--I don't understand,\" he muttered. \"How did this happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"No time for that, sir. Getting the engine out now. Your girl, Thea.\r\nYou'll surely do that for the poor chap. Everybody knows he thinks the\r\nworld of her.\" Seeing that Mr. Kronborg showed no indication of having\r\nmade up his mind, the operator turned to Gunner. \"Call your sister, kid.\r\nI'm going to ask the girl herself,\" he blurted out.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, certainly. Daughter,\" Mr. Kronborg called. He had somewhat\r\nrecovered himself and reached to the hall hatrack for his hat.\r\n\r\nJust as Thea came out on the front porch, before the operator had had\r\ntime to explain to her, Dr. Archie's ponies came up to the gate at a\r\nbrisk trot. Archie jumped out the moment his driver stopped the team and\r\ncame up to the bewildered girl without so much as saying good-morning to\r\nany one. He took her hand with the sympathetic, reassuring graveness\r\nwhich had helped her at more than one hard time in her life. \"Get your\r\nhat, my girl. Kennedy's hurt down the road, and he wants you to run down\r\nwith me. They'll have a car for us. Get into my buggy, Mr. Kronborg.\r\nI'll drive you down, and Larry can come for the team.\"\r\n\r\nThe driver jumped out of the buggy and Mr. Kronborg and the doctor got\r\nin. Thea, still bewildered, sat on her father's knee. Dr. Archie gave\r\nhis ponies a smart cut with the whip.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the depot, the engine, with one car attached, was\r\nstanding on the main track. The engineer had got his steam up, and was\r\nleaning out of the cab impatiently. In a moment they were off. The run\r\nto Saxony took forty minutes. Thea sat still in her seat while Dr.\r\nArchie and her father talked about the wreck. She took no part in the\r\nconversation and asked no questions, but occasionally she looked at Dr.\r\nArchie with a frightened, inquiring glance, which he answered by an\r\nencouraging nod. Neither he nor her father said anything about how badly\r\nRay was hurt. When the engine stopped near Saxony, the main track was\r\nalready cleared. As they got out of the car, Dr. Archie pointed to a\r\npile of ties.\r\n\r\n\"Thea, you'd better sit down here and watch the wreck crew while your\r\nfather and I go up and look Kennedy over. I'll come back for you when I\r\nget him fixed up.\"\r\n\r\nThe two men went off up the sand gulch, and Thea sat down and looked at\r\nthe pile of splintered wood and twisted iron that had lately been Ray's\r\ncaboose. She was frightened and absent-minded. She felt that she ought\r\nto be thinking about Ray, but her mind kept racing off to all sorts of\r\ntrivial and irrelevant things. She wondered whether Grace Johnson would\r\nbe furious when she came to take her music lesson and found nobody there\r\nto give it to her; whether she had forgotten to close the piano last\r\nnight and whether Thor would get into the new room and mess the keys all\r\nup with his sticky fingers; whether Tillie would go upstairs and make\r\nher bed for her. Her mind worked fast, but she could fix it upon\r\nnothing. The grasshoppers, the lizards, distracted her attention and\r\nseemed more real to her than poor Ray.\r\n\r\nOn their way to the sand bank where Ray had been carried, Dr. Archie and\r\nMr. Kronborg met the Saxony doctor. He shook hands with them.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing you can do, doctor. I couldn't count the fractures. His back's\r\nbroken, too. He wouldn't be alive now if he weren't so confoundedly\r\nstrong, poor chap. No use bothering him. I've given him morphia, one and\r\na half, in eighths.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie hurried on. Ray was lying on a flat canvas litter, under the\r\nshelter of a shelving bank, lightly shaded by a slender cottonwood tree.\r\nWhen the doctor and the preacher approached, he looked at them intently.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't--\" he closed his eyes to hide his bitter disappointment.\r\n\r\nDr. Archie knew what was the matter. \"Thea's back there, Ray. I'll bring\r\nher as soon as I've had a look at you.\"\r\n\r\nRay looked up. \"You might clean me up a trifle, doc. Won't need you for\r\nanything else, thank you all the same.\"\r\n\r\nHowever little there was left of him, that little was certainly Ray\r\nKennedy. His personality was as positive as ever, and the blood and dirt\r\non his face seemed merely accidental, to have nothing to do with the man\r\nhimself. Dr. Archie told Mr. Kronborg to bring a pail of water, and he\r\nbegan to sponge Ray's face and neck. Mr. Kronborg stood by, nervously\r\nrubbing his hands together and trying to think of something to say.\r\nSerious situations always embarrassed him and made him formal, even when\r\nhe felt real sympathy.\r\n\r\n\"In times like this, Ray,\" he brought out at last, crumpling up his\r\nhandkerchief in his long fingers,--\"in times like this, we don't want to\r\nforget the Friend that sticketh closer than a brother.\"\r\n\r\nRay looked up at him; a lonely, disconsolate smile played over his mouth\r\nand his square cheeks. \"Never mind about all that, PADRE,\" he said\r\nquietly. \"Christ and me fell out long ago.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence. Then Ray took pity on Mr. Kronborg's\r\nembarrassment. \"You go back for the little girl, PADRE. I want a word\r\nwith the doc in private.\"\r\n\r\nRay talked to Dr. Archie for a few moments, then stopped suddenly, with\r\na broad smile. Over the doctor's shoulder he saw Thea coming up the\r\ngulch, in her pink chambray dress, carrying her sun-hat by the strings.\r\nSuch a yellow head! He often told himself that he \"was perfectly\r\nfoolish about her hair.\" The sight of her, coming, went through\r\nhim softly, like the morphia. \"There she is,\" he whispered. \"Get the old\r\npreacher out of the way, doc. I want to have a little talk with her.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie looked up. Thea was hurrying and yet hanging back. She was\r\nmore frightened than he had thought she would be. She had gone with him\r\nto see very sick people and had always been steady and calm. As she came\r\nup, she looked at the ground, and he could see that she had been crying.\r\n\r\nRay Kennedy made an unsuccessful effort to put out his hand. \"Hello,\r\nlittle kid, nothing to be afraid of. Darned if I don't believe they've\r\ngone and scared you! Nothing to cry about. I'm the same old goods, only\r\na little dented. Sit down on my coat there, and keep me company. I've\r\ngot to lay still a bit.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie and Mr. Kronborg disappeared. Thea cast a timid glance after\r\nthem, but she sat down resolutely and took Ray's hand.\r\n\r\n\"You ain't scared now, are you?\" he asked affectionately. \"You were a\r\nregular brick to come, Thee. Did you get any breakfast?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Ray, I'm not scared. Only I'm dreadful sorry you're hurt, and I\r\ncan't help crying.\"\r\n\r\nHis broad, earnest face, languid from the opium and smiling with such\r\nsimple happiness, reassured her. She drew nearer to him and lifted his\r\nhand to her knee. He looked at her with his clear, shallow blue eyes.\r\nHow he loved everything about that face and head! How many nights in his\r\ncupola, looking up the track, he had seen that face in the darkness;\r\nthrough the sleet and snow, or in the soft blue air when the moonlight\r\nslept on the desert.\r\n\r\n\"You needn't bother to talk, Thee. The doctor's medicine makes me sort\r\nof dopey. But it's nice to have company. Kind of cozy, don't you think?\r\nPull my coat under you more. It's a darned shame I can't wait on you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Ray. I'm all right. Yes, I like it here. And I guess you ought\r\nnot to talk much, ought you? If you can sleep, I'll stay right here, and\r\nbe awful quiet. I feel just as much at home with you as ever, now.\"\r\n\r\nThat simple, humble, faithful something in Ray's eyes went straight to\r\nThea's heart. She did feel comfortable with him, and happy to give him\r\nso much happiness. It was the first time she had ever been conscious of\r\nthat power to bestow intense happiness by simply being near any one. She\r\nalways remembered this day as the beginning of that knowledge. She bent\r\nover him and put her lips softly to his cheek.\r\n\r\nRay's eyes filled with light. \"Oh, do that again, kid!\" he said\r\nimpulsively. Thea kissed him on the forehead, blushing faintly. Ray held\r\nher hand fast and closed his eyes with a deep sigh of happiness. The\r\nmorphia and the sense of her nearness filled him with content. The gold\r\nmine, the oil well, the copper ledge--all pipe dreams, he mused, and\r\nthis was a dream, too. He might have known it before. It had always been\r\nlike that; the things he admired had always been away out of his reach:\r\na college education, a gentleman's manner, an Englishman's\r\naccent--things over his head. And Thea was farther out of his reach than\r\nall the rest put together. He had been a fool to imagine it, but he was\r\nglad he had been a fool. She had given him one grand dream. Every mile\r\nof his run, from Moonstone to Denver, was painted with the colors of\r\nthat hope. Every cactus knew about it. But now that it was not to be, he\r\nknew the truth. Thea was never meant for any rough fellow like\r\nhim--hadn't he really known that all along, he asked himself? She wasn't\r\nmeant for common men. She was like wedding cake, a thing to dream on. He\r\nraised his eyelids a little. She was stroking his hand and looking off\r\ninto the distance. He felt in her face that look of unconscious power\r\nthat Wunsch had seen there. Yes, she was bound for the big terminals of\r\nthe world; no way stations for her. His lids drooped. In the dark he\r\ncould see her as she would be after a while; in a box at the Tabor Grand\r\nin Denver, with diamonds on her neck and a tiara in her yellow hair,\r\nwith all the people looking at her through their opera-glasses, and a\r\nUnited States Senator, maybe, talking to her. \"Then you'll remember me!\"\r\nHe opened his eyes, and they were full of tears.\r\n\r\nThea leaned closer. \"What did you say, Ray? I couldn't hear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you'll remember me,\" he whispered.\r\n\r\nThe spark in his eye, which is one's very self, caught the spark in hers\r\nthat was herself, and for a moment they looked into each other's\r\nnatures. Thea realized how good and how great-hearted he was, and he\r\nrealized about her many things. When that elusive spark of personality\r\nretreated in each of them, Thea still saw in his wet eyes her own face,\r\nvery small, but much prettier than the cracked glass at home had ever\r\nshown it. It was the first time she had seen her face in that kindest\r\nmirror a woman can ever find.\r\n\r\nRay had felt things in that moment when he seemed to be looking into the\r\nvery soul of Thea Kronborg. Yes, the gold mine, the oil well, the copper\r\nledge, they'd all got away from him, as things will; but he'd backed a\r\nwinner once in his life! With all his might he gave his faith to the\r\nbroad little hand he held. He wished he could leave her the rugged\r\nstrength of his body to help her through with it all. He would have\r\nliked to tell her a little about his old dream,--there seemed long years\r\nbetween him and it already,--but to tell her now would somehow be\r\nunfair; wouldn't be quite the straightest thing in the world. Probably\r\nshe knew, anyway. He looked up quickly. \"You know, don't you, Thee, that\r\nI think you are just the finest thing I've struck in this world?\"\r\n\r\nThe tears ran down Thea's cheeks. \"You're too good to me, Ray. You're a\r\nlot too good to me,\" she faltered.\r\n\r\n\"Why, kid,\" he murmured, \"everybody in this world's going to be good to\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie came to the gulch and stood over his patient. \"How's it\r\ngoing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you give me another punch with your pacifier, doc? The little\r\ngirl had better run along now.\" Ray released Thea's hand. \"See you\r\nlater, Thee.\"\r\n\r\nShe got up and moved away aimlessly, carrying her hat by the strings.\r\nRay looked after her with the exaltation born of bodily pain and said\r\nbetween his teeth, \"Always look after that girl, doc. She's a queen!\"\r\n\r\nThea and her father went back to Moonstone on the one-o'clock passenger.\r\nDr. Archie stayed with Ray Kennedy until he died, late in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning, the day after Ray Kennedy's funeral, Dr. Archie\r\ncalled at Mr. Kronborg's study, a little room behind the church. Mr.\r\nKronborg did not write out his sermons, but spoke from notes jotted upon\r\nsmall pieces of cardboard in a kind of shorthand of his own. As sermons\r\ngo, they were not worse than most. His conventional rhetoric pleased the\r\nmajority of his congregation, and Mr. Kronborg was generally regarded as\r\na model preacher. He did not smoke, he never touched spirits. His\r\nindulgence in the pleasures of the table was an endearing bond between\r\nhim and the women of his congregation. He ate enormously, with a zest\r\nwhich seemed incongruous with his spare frame.\r\n\r\nThis morning the doctor found him opening his mail and reading a pile of\r\nadvertising circulars with deep attention.\r\n\r\n\"Good-morning, Mr. Kronborg,\" said Dr. Archie, sitting down. \"I came to\r\nsee you on business. Poor Kennedy asked me to look after his affairs for\r\nhim. Like most railroad men he spent his wages, except for a few\r\ninvestments in mines which don't look to me very promising. But his life\r\nwas insured for six hundred dollars in Thea's favor.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kronborg wound his feet about the standard of his desk-chair. \"I\r\nassure you, doctor, this is a complete surprise to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's not very surprising to me,\" Dr. Archie went on. \"He talked\r\nto me about it the day he was hurt. He said he wanted the money to be\r\nused in a particular way, and in no other.\" Dr. Archie paused meaningly.\r\n\r\nMr. Kronborg fidgeted. \"I am sure Thea would observe his wishes in every\r\nrespect.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt; but he wanted me to see that you agreed to his plan. It seems\r\nthat for some time Thea has wanted to go away to study music. It was\r\nKennedy's wish that she should take this money and go to Chicago this\r\nwinter. He felt that it would be an advantage to her in a business way:\r\nthat even if she came back here to teach, it would give her more\r\nauthority and make her position here more comfortable.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kronborg looked a little startled. \"She is very young,\" he\r\nhesitated; \"she is barely seventeen. Chicago is a long way from home. We\r\nwould have to consider. I think, Dr. Archie, we had better consult Mrs.\r\nKronborg.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I can bring Mrs. Kronborg around, if I have your consent. I've\r\nalways found her pretty level-headed. I have several old classmates\r\npracticing in Chicago. One is a throat specialist. He has a good deal to\r\ndo with singers. He probably knows the best piano teachers and could\r\nrecommend a boarding-house where music students stay. I think Thea needs\r\nto get among a lot of young people who are clever like herself. Here she\r\nhas no companions but old fellows like me. It's not a natural life for a\r\nyoung girl. She'll either get warped, or wither up before her time. If\r\nit will make you and Mrs. Kronborg feel any easier, I'll be glad to take\r\nThea to Chicago and see that she gets started right. This throat man I\r\nspeak of is a big fellow in his line, and if I can get him interested,\r\nhe may be able to put her in the way of a good many things. At any rate,\r\nhe'll know the right teachers. Of course, six hundred dollars won't take\r\nher very far, but even half the winter there would be a great advantage.\r\nI think Kennedy sized the situation up exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps; I don't doubt it. You are very kind, Dr. Archie.\" Mr. Kronborg\r\nwas ornamenting his desk-blotter with hieroglyphics. \"I should think\r\nDenver might be better. There we could watch over her. She is very\r\nyoung.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie rose. \"Kennedy didn't mention Denver. He said Chicago,\r\nrepeatedly. Under the circumstances, it seems to me we ought to try to\r\ncarry out his wishes exactly, if Thea is willing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, certainly. Thea is conscientious. She would not waste her\r\nopportunities.\" Mr. Kronborg paused. \"If Thea were your own daughter,\r\ndoctor, would you consent to such a plan, at her present age?\"\r\n\r\n\"I most certainly should. In fact, if she were my daughter, I'd have\r\nsent her away before this. She's a most unusual child, and she's only\r\nwasting herself here. At her age she ought to be learning, not teaching.\r\nShe'll never learn so quickly and easily as she will right now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, doctor, you had better talk it over with Mrs. Kronborg. I make it\r\na point to defer to her wishes in such matters. She understands all her\r\nchildren perfectly. I may say that she has all a mother's insight, and\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie smiled. \"Yes, and then some. I feel quite confident about\r\nMrs. Kronborg. We usually agree. Good-morning.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie stepped out into the hot sunshine and walked rapidly toward\r\nhis office, with a determined look on his face. He found his\r\nwaiting-room full of patients, and it was one o'clock before he had\r\ndismissed the last one. Then he shut his door and took a drink before\r\ngoing over to the hotel for his lunch. He smiled as he locked his\r\ncupboard. \"I feel almost as gay as if I were going to get away for a\r\nwinter myself,\" he thought.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfterward Thea could never remember much about that summer, or how she\r\nlived through her impatience. She was to set off with Dr. Archie on the\r\nfifteenth of October, and she gave lessons until the first of September.\r\nThen she began to get her clothes ready, and spent whole afternoons in\r\nthe village dressmaker's stuffy, littered little sewing-room. Thea and\r\nher mother made a trip to Denver to buy the materials for her dresses.\r\nReady-made clothes for girls were not to be had in those days. Miss\r\nSpencer, the dressmaker, declared that she could do handsomely by Thea\r\nif they would only let her carry out her own ideas. But Mrs. Kronborg\r\nand Thea felt that Miss Spencer's most daring productions might seem out\r\nof place in Chicago, so they restrained her with a firm hand. Tillie,\r\nwho always helped Mrs. Kronborg with the family sewing, was for letting\r\nMiss Spencer challenge Chicago on Thea's person. Since Ray Kennedy's\r\ndeath, Thea had become more than ever one of Tillie's heroines. Tillie\r\nswore each of her friends to secrecy, and, coming home from church or\r\nleaning over the fence, told them the most touching stories about Ray's\r\ndevotion, and how Thea would \"never get over it.\"\r\n\r\nTillie's confidences stimulated the general discussion of Thea's\r\nventure. This discussion went on, upon front porches and in back yards,\r\npretty much all summer. Some people approved of Thea's going to Chicago,\r\nbut most people did not. There were others who changed their minds about\r\nit every day.\r\n\r\nTillie said she wanted Thea to have a ball dress \"above all things.\" She\r\nbought a fashion book especially devoted to evening clothes and looked\r\nhungrily over the colored plates, picking out costumes that would be\r\nbecoming to \"a blonde.\" She wanted Thea to have all the gay clothes she\r\nherself had always longed for; clothes she often told herself she needed\r\n\"to recite in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tillie,\" Thea used to cry impatiently, \"can't you see that if Miss\r\nSpencer tried to make one of those things, she'd make me look like a\r\ncircus girl? Anyhow, I don't know anybody in Chicago. I won't be going\r\nto parties.\"\r\n\r\nTillie always replied with a knowing toss of her head, \"You see! You'll\r\nbe in society before you know it. There ain't many girls as accomplished\r\nas you.\"\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the fifteenth of October the Kronborg family, all of\r\nthem but Gus, who couldn't leave the store, started for the station an\r\nhour before train time. Charley had taken Thea's trunk and telescope to\r\nthe depot in his delivery wagon early that morning. Thea wore her new\r\nblue serge traveling-dress, chosen for its serviceable qualities. She\r\nhad done her hair up carefully, and had put a pale-blue ribbon around\r\nher throat, under a little lace collar that Mrs. Kohler had crocheted\r\nfor her. As they went out of the gate, Mrs. Kronborg looked her over\r\nthoughtfully. Yes, that blue ribbon went very well with the dress, and\r\nwith Thea's eyes. Thea had a rather unusual touch about such things, she\r\nreflected comfortably. Tillie always said that Thea was \"so indifferent\r\nto dress,\" but her mother noticed that she usually put her clothes on\r\nwell. She felt the more at ease about letting Thea go away from home,\r\nbecause she had good sense about her clothes and never tried to dress up\r\ntoo much. Her coloring was so individual, she was so unusually fair,\r\nthat in the wrong clothes she might easily have been \"conspicuous.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a fine morning, and the family set out from the house in good\r\nspirits. Thea was quiet and calm. She had forgotten nothing, and she\r\nclung tightly to her handbag, which held her trunk-key and all of her\r\nmoney that was not in an envelope pinned to her chemise. Thea walked\r\nbehind the others, holding Thor by the hand, and this time she did not\r\nfeel that the procession was too long. Thor was uncommunicative that\r\nmorning, and would only talk about how he would rather get a sand bur in\r\nhis toe every day than wear shoes and stockings. As they passed the\r\ncottonwood grove where Thea often used to bring him in his cart, she\r\nasked him who would take him for nice long walks after sister went away.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I can walk in our yard,\" he replied unappreciatively. \"I guess I\r\ncan make a pond for my duck.\"\r\n\r\nThea leaned down and looked into his face. \"But you won't forget about\r\nsister, will you?\" Thor shook his head. \"And won't you be glad when\r\nsister comes back and can take you over to Mrs. Kohler's to see the\r\npigeons?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'll be glad. But I'm going to have a pigeon my own self.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you haven't got any little house for one. Maybe Axel would make you\r\na little house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, her can live in the barn, her can,\" Thor drawled indifferently.\r\n\r\nThea laughed and squeezed his hand. She always liked his sturdy\r\nmatter-of-factness. Boys ought to be like that, she thought.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the depot, Mr. Kronborg paced the platform somewhat\r\nceremoniously with his daughter. Any member of his flock would have\r\ngathered that he was giving her good counsel about meeting the\r\ntemptations of the world. He did, indeed, begin to admonish her not to\r\nforget that talents come from our Heavenly Father and are to be used for\r\nhis glory, but he cut his remarks short and looked at his watch. He\r\nbelieved that Thea was a religious girl, but when she looked at him with\r\nthat intent, that passionately inquiring gaze which used to move even\r\nWunsch, Mr. Kronborg suddenly felt his eloquence fail. Thea was like her\r\nmother, he reflected; you couldn't put much sentiment across with her.\r\nAs a usual thing, he liked girls to be a little more responsive. He\r\nliked them to blush at his compliments; as Mrs. Kronborg candidly said,\r\n\"Father could be very soft with the girls.\" But this morning he was\r\nthinking that hard-headedness was a reassuring quality in a daughter who\r\nwas going to Chicago alone.\r\n\r\nMr. Kronborg believed that big cities were places where people went to\r\nlose their identity and to be wicked. He himself, when he was a student\r\nat the Seminary--he coughed and opened his watch again. He knew, of\r\ncourse, that a great deal of business went on in Chicago, that there was\r\nan active Board of Trade, and that hogs and cattle were slaughtered\r\nthere. But when, as a young man, he had stopped over in Chicago, he had\r\nnot interested himself in the commercial activities of the city. He\r\nremembered it as a place full of cheap shows and dance halls and boys\r\nfrom the country who were behaving disgustingly.\r\n\r\nDr. Archie drove up to the station about ten minutes before the train\r\nwas due. His man tied the ponies and stood holding the doctor's\r\nalligator-skin bag--very elegant, Thea thought it. Mrs. Kronborg did not\r\nburden the doctor with warnings and cautions. She said again that she\r\nhoped he could get Thea a comfortable place to stay, where they had good\r\nbeds, and she hoped the landlady would be a woman who'd had children of\r\nher own. \"I don't go much on old maids looking after girls,\" she\r\nremarked as she took a pin out of her own hat and thrust it into Thea's\r\nblue turban. \"You'll be sure to lose your hatpins on the train, Thea.\r\nIt's better to have an extra one in case.\" She tucked in a little curl\r\nthat had escaped from Thea's careful twist. \"Don't forget to brush your\r\ndress often, and pin it up to the curtains of your berth to-night, so it\r\nwon't wrinkle. If you get it wet, have a tailor press it before it\r\ndraws.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned Thea about by the shoulders and looked her over a last time.\r\nYes, she looked very well. She wasn't pretty, exactly,--her face was too\r\nbroad and her nose was too big. But she had that lovely skin, and she\r\nlooked fresh and sweet. She had always been a sweet-smelling child. Her\r\nmother had always liked to kiss her, when she happened to think of it.\r\n\r\nThe train whistled in, and Mr. Kronborg carried the canvas \"telescope\"\r\ninto the car. Thea kissed them all good-bye. Tillie cried, but she was\r\nthe only one who did. They all shouted things up at the closed window of\r\nthe Pullman car, from which Thea looked down at them as from a frame,\r\nher face glowing with excitement, her turban a little tilted in spite of\r\nthree hatpins. She had already taken off her new gloves to save them.\r\nMrs. Kronborg reflected that she would never see just that same picture\r\nagain, and as Thea's car slid off along the rails, she wiped a tear from\r\nher eye. \"She won't come back a little girl,\" Mrs. Kronborg said to her\r\nhusband as they turned to go home. \"Anyhow, she's been a sweet one.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the Kronborg family were trooping slowly homeward, Thea was\r\nsitting in the Pullman, her telescope in the seat beside her, her\r\nhandbag tightly gripped in her fingers. Dr. Archie had gone into the\r\nsmoker. He thought she might be a little tearful, and that it would be\r\nkinder to leave her alone for a while. Her eyes did fill once, when she\r\nsaw the last of the sand hills and realized that she was going to leave\r\nthem behind for a long while. They always made her think of Ray, too.\r\nShe had had such good times with him out there.\r\n\r\nBut, of course, it was herself and her own adventure that mattered to\r\nher. If youth did not matter so much to itself, it would never have the\r\nheart to go on. Thea was surprised that she did not feel a deeper sense\r\nof loss at leaving her old life behind her. It seemed, on the contrary,\r\nas she looked out at the yellow desert speeding by, that she had left\r\nvery little. Everything that was essential seemed to be right there in\r\nthe car with her. She lacked nothing. She even felt more compact and\r\nconfident than usual. She was all there, and something else was there,\r\ntoo,--in her heart, was it, or under her cheek? Anyhow, it was about her\r\nsomewhere, that warm sureness, that sturdy little companion with whom\r\nshe shared a secret.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Archie came in from the smoker, she was sitting still, looking\r\nintently out of the window and smiling, her lips a little parted, her\r\nhair in a blaze of sunshine. The doctor thought she was the prettiest\r\nthing he had ever seen, and very funny, with her telescope and big\r\nhandbag. She made him feel jolly, and a little mournful, too. He knew\r\nthat the splendid things of life are few, after all, and so very easy to\r\nmiss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II. THE SONG OF THE LARK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHEA and Dr. Archie had been gone from Moonstone four days. On the\r\nafternoon of the nineteenth of October they were in a street-car, riding\r\nthrough the depressing, unkept wastes of North Chicago, on their way to\r\ncall upon the Reverend Lars Larsen, a friend to whom Mr. Kronborg had\r\nwritten. Thea was still staying at the rooms of the Young Women's\r\nChristian Association, and was miserable and homesick there. The\r\nhousekeeper watched her in a way that made her uncomfortable. Things had\r\nnot gone very well, so far. The noise and confusion of a big city tired\r\nand disheartened her. She had not had her trunk sent to the Christian\r\nAssociation rooms because she did not want to double cartage charges,\r\nand now she was running up a bill for storage on it. The contents of her\r\ngray telescope were becoming untidy, and it seemed impossible to keep\r\none's face and hands clean in Chicago. She felt as if she were still on\r\nthe train, traveling without enough clothes to keep clean. She wanted\r\nanother nightgown, and it did not occur to her that she could buy one.\r\nThere were other clothes in her trunk that she needed very much, and she\r\nseemed no nearer a place to stay than when she arrived in the rain, on\r\nthat first disillusioning morning.\r\n\r\nDr. Archie had gone at once to his friend Hartley Evans, the throat\r\nspecialist, and had asked him to tell him of a good piano teacher and\r\ndirect him to a good boarding-house. Dr. Evans said he could easily tell\r\nhim who was the best piano teacher in Chicago, but that most students'\r\nboarding-houses were \"abominable places, where girls got poor food for body\r\nand mind.\" He gave Dr. Archie several addresses, however, and the doctor\r\nwent to look the places over. He left Thea in her room, for she seemed\r\ntired and was not at all like herself. His inspection of boardinghouses\r\nwas not encouraging. The only place that seemed to him at all desirable\r\nwas full, and the mistress of the house could not give Thea a room in\r\nwhich she could have a piano. She said Thea might use the piano in her\r\nparlor; but when Dr. Archie went to look at the parlor he found a girl\r\ntalking to a young man on one of the corner sofas. Learning that the\r\nboarders received all their callers there, he gave up that house, too,\r\nas hopeless.\r\n\r\nSo when they set out to make the acquaintance of Mr. Larsen on the\r\nafternoon he had appointed, the question of a lodging was still\r\nundecided. The Swedish Reform Church was in a sloughy, weedy district,\r\nnear a group of factories. The church itself was a very neat little\r\nbuilding. The parsonage, next door, looked clean and comfortable, and\r\nthere was a well-kept yard about it, with a picket fence. Thea saw\r\nseveral little children playing under a swing, and wondered why\r\nministers always had so many. When they rang at the parsonage door, a\r\ncapable-looking Swedish servant girl answered the bell and told them\r\nthat Mr. Larsen's study was in the church, and that he was waiting for\r\nthem there.\r\n\r\nMr. Larsen received them very cordially. The furniture in his study was\r\nso new and the pictures were so heavily framed, that Thea thought it\r\nlooked more like the waiting-room of the fashionable Denver dentist to\r\nwhom Dr. Archie had taken her that summer, than like a preacher's study.\r\nThere were even flowers in a glass vase on the desk. Mr. Larsen was a\r\nsmall, plump man, with a short, yellow beard, very white teeth, and a\r\nlittle turned-up nose on which he wore gold-rimmed eye-glasses. He\r\nlooked about thirty-five, but he was growing bald, and his thin, hair\r\nwas parted above his left ear and brought up over the bare spot on the\r\ntop of his head. He looked cheerful and agreeable. He wore a blue coat\r\nand no cuffs.\r\n\r\nAfter Dr. Archie and Thea sat down on a slippery leather couch, the\r\nminister asked for an outline of Thea's plans. Dr. Archie explained that\r\nshe meant to study piano with Andor Harsanyi; that they had already seen\r\nhim, that Thea had played for him and he said he would be glad to teach\r\nher.\r\n\r\nMr. Larsen lifted his pale eyebrows and rubbed his plump white hands\r\ntogether. \"But he is a concert pianist already. He will be very\r\nexpensive.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's why Miss Kronborg wants to get a church position if possible.\r\nShe has not money enough to see her through the winter. There's no use\r\nher coming all the way from Colorado and studying with a second-rate\r\nteacher. My friends here tell me Harsanyi is the best.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very likely! I have heard him play with Thomas. You Western people\r\ndo things on a big scale. There are half a dozen teachers that I should\r\nthink--However, you know what you want.\" Mr. Larsen showed his contempt\r\nfor such extravagant standards by a shrug. He felt that Dr. Archie was\r\ntrying to impress him. He had succeeded, indeed, in bringing out the\r\ndoctor's stiffest manner. Mr. Larsen went on to explain that he managed\r\nthe music in his church himself, and drilled his choir, though the tenor\r\nwas the official choirmaster. Unfortunately there were no vacancies in\r\nhis choir just now. He had his four voices, very good ones. He looked\r\naway from Dr. Archie and glanced at Thea. She looked troubled, even a\r\nlittle frightened when he said this, and drew in her lower lip. She,\r\ncertainly, was not pretentious, if her protector was. He continued to\r\nstudy her. She was sitting on the lounge, her knees far apart, her\r\ngloved hands lying stiffly in her lap, like a country girl. Her turban,\r\nwhich seemed a little too big for her, had got tilted in the wind,--it\r\nwas always windy in that part of Chicago,--and she looked tired. She\r\nwore no veil, and her hair, too, was the worse for the wind and dust.\r\nWhen he said he had all the voices he required, he noticed that her\r\ngloved hands shut tightly. Mr. Larsen reflected that she was not, after\r\nall, responsible for the lofty manner of her father's physician; that\r\nshe was not even responsible for her father, whom he remembered as a\r\ntiresome fellow. As he watched her tired, worried face, he felt sorry\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\n\"All the same, I would like to try your voice,\" he said, turning\r\npointedly away from her companion. \"I am interested in voices. Can you\r\nsing to the violin?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess so,\" Thea replied dully. \"I don't know. I never tried.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Larsen took his violin out of the case and began to tighten the\r\nkeys. \"We might go into the lecture-room and see how it goes. I can't\r\ntell much about a voice by the organ. The violin is really the proper\r\ninstrument to try a voice.\" He opened a door at the back of his study,\r\npushed Thea gently through it, and looking over his shoulder to Dr.\r\nArchie said, \"Excuse us, sir. We will be back soon.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie chuckled. All preachers were alike, officious and on their\r\ndignity; liked to deal with women and girls, but not with men. He took\r\nup a thin volume from the minister's desk. To his amusement it proved to\r\nbe a book of \"Devotional and Kindred Poems; by Mrs. Aurelia S. Larsen.\"\r\nHe looked them over, thinking that the world changed very little. He\r\ncould remember when the wife of his father's minister had published a\r\nvolume of verses, which all the church members had to buy and all the\r\nchildren were encouraged to read. His grandfather had made a face at the\r\nbook and said, \"Puir body!\" Both ladies seemed to have chosen the same\r\nsubjects, too: Jephthah's Daughter, Rizpah, David's Lament for Absalom,\r\netc. The doctor found the book very amusing.\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Lars Larsen was a reactionary Swede. His father came to\r\nIowa in the sixties, married a Swedish girl who was ambitious, like\r\nhimself, and they moved to Kansas and took up land under the Homestead\r\nAct. After that, they bought land and leased it from the Government,\r\nacquired land in every possible way. They worked like horses, both of\r\nthem; indeed, they would never have used any horse-flesh they owned as\r\nthey used themselves. They reared a large family and worked their sons\r\nand daughters as mercilessly as they worked themselves; all of them but\r\nLars. Lars was the fourth son, and he was born lazy. He seemed to bear\r\nthe mark of overstrain on the part of his parents. Even in his cradle he\r\nwas an example of physical inertia; anything to lie still. When he was a\r\ngrowing boy his mother had to drag him out of bed every morning, and he\r\nhad to be driven to his chores. At school he had a model \"attendance\r\nrecord,\" because he found getting his lessons easier than farm work. He\r\nwas the only one of the family who went through the high school, and by\r\nthe time he graduated he had already made up his mind to study for the\r\nministry, because it seemed to him the least laborious of all callings.\r\nIn so far as he could see, it was the only business in which there was\r\npractically no competition, in which a man was not all the time pitted\r\nagainst other men who were willing to work themselves to death. His\r\nfather stubbornly opposed Lars's plan, but after keeping the boy at home\r\nfor a year and finding how useless he was on the farm, he sent him to a\r\ntheological seminary--as much to conceal his laziness from the neighbors\r\nas because he did not know what else to do with him.\r\n\r\nLarsen, like Peter Kronborg, got on well in the ministry, because he got\r\non well with the women. His English was no worse than that of most young\r\npreachers of American parentage, and he made the most of his skill with\r\nthe violin. He was supposed to exert a very desirable influence over\r\nyoung people and to stimulate their interest in church work. He married\r\nan American girl, and when his father died he got his share of the\r\nproperty--which was very considerable. He invested his money carefully\r\nand was that rare thing, a preacher of independent means. His white,\r\nwell-kept hands were his result,--the evidence that he had worked out\r\nhis life successfully in the way that pleased him. His Kansas brothers\r\nhated the sight of his hands.\r\n\r\nLarsen liked all the softer things of life,--in so far as he knew about\r\nthem. He slept late in the morning, was fussy about his food, and read a\r\ngreat many novels, preferring sentimental ones. He did not smoke, but he\r\nate a great deal of candy \"for his throat,\" and always kept a box of\r\nchocolate drops in the upper right-hand drawer of his desk. He always\r\nbought season tickets for the symphony concerts, and he played his\r\nviolin for women's culture clubs. He did not wear cuffs, except on\r\nSunday, because he believed that a free wrist facilitated his violin\r\npractice. When he drilled his choir he always held his hand with the\r\nlittle and index fingers curved higher than the other two, like a noted\r\nGerman conductor he had seen. On the whole, the Reverend Larsen was not\r\nan insincere man; he merely spent his life resting and playing, to make\r\nup for the time his forebears had wasted grubbing in the earth. He was\r\nsimple-hearted and kind; he enjoyed his candy and his children and his\r\nsacred cantatas. He could work energetically at almost any form of play.\r\n\r\nDr. Archie was deep in \"The Lament of Mary Magdalen,\" when Mr. Larsen\r\nand Thea came back to the study. From the minister's expression he\r\njudged that Thea had succeeded in interesting him.\r\n\r\nMr. Larsen seemed to have forgotten his hostility toward him, and\r\naddressed him frankly as soon as he entered. He stood holding his\r\nviolin, and as Thea sat down he pointed to her with his bow:--\r\n\r\n\"I have just been telling Miss Kronborg that though I cannot promise her\r\nanything permanent, I might give her something for the next few months.\r\nMy soprano is a young married woman and is temporarily indisposed. She\r\nwould be glad to be excused from her duties for a while. I like Miss\r\nKronborg's singing very much, and I think she would benefit by the\r\ninstruction in my choir. Singing here might very well lead to something\r\nelse. We pay our soprano only eight dollars a Sunday, but she always\r\ngets ten dollars for singing at funerals. Miss Kronborg has a\r\nsympathetic voice, and I think there would be a good deal of demand for\r\nher at funerals. Several American churches apply to me for a soloist on\r\nsuch occasions, and I could help her to pick up quite a little money\r\nthat way.\"\r\n\r\nThis sounded lugubrious to Dr. Archie, who had a physician's dislike of\r\nfunerals, but he tried to accept the suggestion cordially.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Kronborg tells me she is having some trouble getting located,\" Mr.\r\nLarsen went on with animation, still holding his violin. \"I would advise\r\nher to keep away from boarding-houses altogether. Among my parishioners\r\nthere are two German women, a mother and daughter. The daughter is a\r\nSwede by marriage, and clings to the Swedish Church. They live near\r\nhere, and they rent some of their rooms. They have now a large room\r\nvacant, and have asked me to recommend some one. They have never taken\r\nboarders, but Mrs. Lorch, the mother, is a good cook,--at least, I am\r\nalways glad to take supper with her,--and I think I could persuade her\r\nto let this young woman partake of the family table. The daughter, Mrs.\r\nAndersen, is musical, too, and sings in the Mozart Society. I think they\r\nmight like to have a music student in the house. You speak German, I\r\nsuppose?\" he turned to Thea.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; a few words. I don't know the grammar,\" she murmured.\r\n\r\nDr. Archie noticed that her eyes looked alive again, not frozen as they\r\nhad looked all morning. \"If this fellow can help her, it's not for me to\r\nbe stand-offish,\" he said to himself.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think you would like to stay in such a quiet place, with\r\nold-fashioned people?\" Mr. Larsen asked. \"I shouldn't think you could\r\nfind a better place to work, if that's what you want.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think mother would like to have me with people like that,\" Thea\r\nreplied. \"And I'd be glad to settle down most anywhere. I'm losing\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, there's no time like the present. Let us go to see Mrs.\r\nLorch and Mrs. Andersen.\"\r\n\r\nThe minister put his violin in its case and caught up a black-and-white\r\nchecked traveling-cap that he wore when he rode his high Columbia wheel.\r\nThe three left the church together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nSO Thea did not go to a boarding-house after all. When Dr. Archie left\r\nChicago she was comfortably settled with Mrs. Lorch, and her happy\r\nreunion with her trunk somewhat consoled her for his departure.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lorch and her daughter lived half a mile from the Swedish Reform\r\nChurch, in an old square frame house, with a porch supported by frail\r\npillars, set in a damp yard full of big lilac bushes. The house, which\r\nhad been left over from country times, needed paint badly, and looked\r\ngloomy and despondent among its smart Queen Anne neighbors. There was a\r\nbig back yard with two rows of apple trees and a grape arbor, and a\r\nwarped walk, two planks wide, which led to the coal bins at the back of\r\nthe lot. Thea's room was on the second floor, overlooking this back\r\nyard, and she understood that in the winter she must carry up her own\r\ncoal and kindling from the bin. There was no furnace in the house, no\r\nrunning water except in the kitchen, and that was why the room rent was\r\nsmall. All the rooms were heated by stoves, and the lodgers pumped the\r\nwater they needed from the cistern under the porch, or from the well at\r\nthe entrance of the grape arbor. Old Mrs. Lorch could never bring\r\nherself to have costly improvements made in her house; indeed she had\r\nvery little money. She preferred to keep the house just as her husband\r\nbuilt it, and she thought her way of living good enough for plain\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThea's room was large enough to admit a rented upright piano without\r\ncrowding. It was, the widowed daughter said, \"a double room that had\r\nalways before been occupied by two gentlemen\"; the piano now took the\r\nplace of a second occupant. There was an ingrain carpet on the floor,\r\ngreen ivy leaves on a red ground, and clumsy, old-fashioned walnut\r\nfurniture. The bed was very wide, and the mattress thin and hard. Over\r\nthe fat pillows were \"shams\" embroidered in Turkey red, each with a\r\nflowering scroll--one with \"Gute' Nacht,\" the other with \"Guten Morgen.\"\r\nThe dresser was so big that Thea wondered how it had ever been got into\r\nthe house and up the narrow stairs. Besides an old horsehair armchair,\r\nthere were two low plush \"spring-rockers,\" against the massive pedestals\r\nof which one was always stumbling in the dark. Thea sat in the dark a\r\ngood deal those first weeks, and sometimes a painful bump against one of\r\nthose brutally immovable pedestals roused her temper and pulled her out\r\nof a heavy hour. The wall-paper was brownish yellow, with blue flowers.\r\nWhen it was put on, the carpet, certainly, had not been consulted. There\r\nwas only one picture on the wall when Thea moved in: a large colored\r\nprint of a brightly lighted church in a snow-storm, on Christmas Eve,\r\nwith greens hanging about the stone doorway and arched windows. There\r\nwas something warm and home, like about this picture, and Thea grew fond\r\nof it. One day, on her way into town to take her lesson, she stopped at\r\na bookstore and bought a photograph of the Naples bust of Julius Caesar.\r\nThis she had framed, and hung it on the big bare wall behind her stove.\r\nIt was a curious choice, but she was at the age when people do\r\ninexplicable things. She had been interested in Caesar's \"Commentaries\"\r\nwhen she left school to begin teaching, and she loved to read about\r\ngreat generals; but these facts would scarcely explain her wanting that\r\ngrim bald head to share her daily existence. It seemed a strange freak,\r\nwhen she bought so few things, and when she had, as Mrs. Andersen said\r\nto Mrs. Lorch, \"no pictures of the composers at all.\"\r\n\r\nBoth the widows were kind to her, but Thea liked the mother better. Old\r\nMrs. Lorch was fat and jolly, with a red face, always shining as if she\r\nhad just come from the stove, bright little eyes, and hair of several\r\ncolors. Her own hair was one cast of iron-gray, her switch another, and\r\nher false front still another. Her clothes always smelled of savory\r\ncooking, except when she was dressed for church or KAFFEEKLATSCH, and\r\nthen she smelled of bay rum or of the lemon-verbena sprig which she\r\ntucked inside her puffy black kid glove. Her cooking justified all that\r\nMr. Larsen had said of it, and Thea had never been so well nourished\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe daughter, Mrs. Andersen,--Irene, her mother called her,--was a\r\ndifferent sort of woman altogether. She was perhaps forty years old,\r\nangular, big-boned, with large, thin features, light-blue eyes, and dry,\r\nyellow hair, the bang tightly frizzed. She was pale, anaemic, and\r\nsentimental. She had married the youngest son of a rich, arrogant\r\nSwedish family who were lumber merchants in St. Paul. There she dwelt\r\nduring her married life. Oscar Andersen was a strong, full-blooded\r\nfellow who had counted on a long life and had been rather careless about\r\nhis business affairs. He was killed by the explosion of a steam boiler\r\nin the mills, and his brothers managed to prove that he had very little\r\nstock in the big business. They had strongly disapproved of his marriage\r\nand they agreed among themselves that they were entirely justified in\r\ndefrauding his widow, who, they said, \"would only marry again and give\r\nsome fellow a good thing of it.\" Mrs. Andersen would not go to law with\r\nthe family that had always snubbed and wounded her--she felt the\r\nhumiliation of being thrust out more than she felt her impoverishment;\r\nso she went back to Chicago to live with her widowed mother on an income\r\nof five hundred a year. This experience had given her sentimental nature\r\nan incurable hurt. Something withered away in her. Her head had a\r\ndownward droop; her step was soft and apologetic, even in her mother's\r\nhouse, and her smile had the sickly, uncertain flicker that so often\r\ncomes from a secret humiliation. She was affable and yet shrinking, like\r\none who has come down in the world, who has known better clothes, better\r\ncarpets, better people, brighter hopes. Her husband was buried in the\r\nAndersen lot in St. Paul, with a locked iron fence around it. She had to\r\ngo to his eldest brother for the key when she went to say good-bye to\r\nhis grave. She clung to the Swedish Church because it had been her\r\nhusband's church.\r\n\r\nAs her mother had no room for her household belongings, Mrs. Andersen\r\nhad brought home with her only her bedroom set, which now furnished her\r\nown room at Mrs. Lorch's. There she spent most of her time, doing\r\nfancywork or writing letters to sympathizing German friends in St. Paul,\r\nsurrounded by keepsakes and photographs of the burly Oscar Andersen.\r\nThea, when she was admitted to this room, and shown these photographs,\r\nfound herself wondering, like the Andersen family, why such a lusty,\r\ngay-looking fellow ever thought he wanted this pallid, long-cheeked\r\nwoman, whose manner was always that of withdrawing, and who must have\r\nbeen rather thin-blooded even as a girl.\r\n\r\nMrs. Andersen was certainly a depressing person. It sometimes annoyed\r\nThea very much to hear her insinuating knock on the door, her flurried\r\nexplanation of why she had come, as she backed toward the stairs. Mrs.\r\nAndersen admired Thea greatly. She thought it a distinction to be even a\r\n\"temporary soprano\"--Thea called herself so quite seriously--in the\r\nSwedish Church. She also thought it distinguished to be a pupil of\r\nHarsanyi's. She considered Thea very handsome, very Swedish, very\r\ntalented. She fluttered about the upper floor when Thea was practicing.\r\nIn short, she tried to make a heroine of her, just as Tillie Kronborg\r\nhad always done, and Thea was conscious of something of the sort. When\r\nshe was working and heard Mrs. Andersen tip-toeing past her door, she\r\nused to shrug her shoulders and wonder whether she was always to have a\r\nTillie diving furtively about her in some disguise or other.\r\n\r\nAt the dressmaker's Mrs. Andersen recalled Tillie even more painfully.\r\nAfter her first Sunday in Mr. Larsen's choir, Thea saw that she must\r\nhave a proper dress for morning service. Her Moonstone party dress might\r\ndo to wear in the evening, but she must have one frock that could stand\r\nthe light of day. She, of course, knew nothing about Chicago\r\ndressmakers, so she let Mrs. Andersen take her to a German woman whom\r\nshe recommended warmly. The German dressmaker was excitable and\r\ndramatic. Concert dresses, she said, were her specialty. In her\r\nfitting-room there were photographs of singers in the dresses she had\r\nmade them for this or that SANGERFEST. She and Mrs. Andersen together\r\nachieved a costume which would have warmed Tillie Kronborg's heart. It\r\nwas clearly intended for a woman of forty, with violent tastes. There\r\nseemed to be a piece of every known fabric in it somewhere. When it came\r\nhome, and was spread out on her huge bed, Thea looked it over and told\r\nherself candidly that it was \"a horror.\" However, her money was gone,\r\nand there was nothing to do but make the best of the dress. She never\r\nwore it except, as she said, \"to sing in,\" as if it were an unbecoming\r\nuniform. When Mrs. Lorch and Irene told her that she \"looked like a\r\nlittle bird-of-Paradise in it,\" Thea shut her teeth and repeated to\r\nherself words she had learned from Joe Giddy and Spanish Johnny.\r\n\r\nIn these two good women Thea found faithful friends, and in their house\r\nshe found the quiet and peace which helped her to support the great\r\nexperiences of that winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nANDOR HARSANYI had never had a pupil in the least like Thea Kronborg. He\r\nhad never had one more intelligent, and he had never had one so\r\nignorant. When Thea sat down to take her first lesson from him, she had\r\nnever heard a work by Beethoven or a composition by Chopin. She knew\r\ntheir names vaguely. Wunsch had been a musician once, long before he\r\nwandered into Moonstone, but when Thea awoke his interest there was not\r\nmuch left of him. From him Thea had learned something about the works of\r\nGluck and Bach, and he used to play her some of the compositions of\r\nSchumann. In his trunk he had a mutilated score of the F sharp minor\r\nsonata, which he had heard Clara Schumann play at a festival in Leipsic.\r\nThough his powers of execution were at such a low ebb, he used to play\r\nat this sonata for his pupil and managed to give her some idea of its\r\nbeauty. When Wunsch was a young man, it was still daring to like\r\nSchumann; enthusiasm for his work was considered an expression of\r\nyouthful waywardness. Perhaps that was why Wunsch remembered him best.\r\nThea studied some of the KINDERSZENEN with him, as well as some little\r\nsonatas by Mozart and Clementi. But for the most part Wunsch stuck to\r\nCzerny and Hummel.\r\n\r\nHarsanyi found in Thea a pupil with sure, strong hands, one who read\r\nrapidly and intelligently, who had, he felt, a richly gifted nature. But\r\nshe had been given no direction, and her ardor was unawakened. She had\r\nnever heard a symphony orchestra. The literature of the piano was an\r\nundiscovered world to her. He wondered how she had been able to work so\r\nhard when she knew so little of what she was working toward. She had\r\nbeen taught according to the old Stuttgart method; stiff back, stiff\r\nelbows, a very formal position of the hands. The best thing about her\r\npreparation was that she had developed an unusual power of work. He\r\nnoticed at once her way of charging at difficulties. She ran to meet\r\nthem as if they were foes she had long been seeking, seized them as if\r\nthey were destined for her and she for them. Whatever she did well, she\r\ntook for granted. Her eagerness aroused all the young Hungarian's\r\nchivalry. Instinctively one went to the rescue of a creature who had so\r\nmuch to overcome and who struggled so hard. He used to tell his wife\r\nthat Miss Kronborg's hour took more out of him than half a dozen other\r\nlessons. He usually kept her long over time; he changed her lessons\r\nabout so that he could do so, and often gave her time at the end of the\r\nday, when he could talk to her afterward and play for her a little from\r\nwhat he happened to be studying. It was always interesting to play for\r\nher. Sometimes she was so silent that he wondered, when she left him,\r\nwhether she had got anything out of it. But a week later, two weeks\r\nlater, she would give back his idea again in a way that set him\r\nvibrating.\r\n\r\nAll this was very well for Harsanyi; an interesting variation in the\r\nroutine of teaching. But for Thea Kronborg, that winter was almost\r\nbeyond enduring. She always remembered it as the happiest and wildest\r\nand saddest of her life. Things came too fast for her; she had not had\r\nenough preparation. There were times when she came home from her lesson\r\nand lay upon her bed hating Wunsch and her family, hating a world that\r\nhad let her grow up so ignorant; when she wished that she could die then\r\nand there, and be born over again to begin anew. She said something of\r\nthis kind once to her teacher, in the midst of a bitter struggle.\r\nHarsanyi turned the light of his wonderful eye upon her--poor fellow, he\r\nhad but one, though that was set in such a handsome head--and said\r\nslowly: \"Every artist makes himself born. It is very much harder than\r\nthe other time, and longer. Your mother did not bring anything into the\r\nworld to play piano. That you must bring into the world yourself.\"\r\n\r\nThis comforted Thea temporarily, for it seemed to give her a chance. But\r\na great deal of the time she was comfortless. Her letters to Dr. Archie\r\nwere brief and businesslike. She was not apt to chatter much, even in\r\nthe stimulating company of people she liked, and to chatter on paper was\r\nsimply impossible for her. If she tried to write him anything definite\r\nabout her work, she immediately scratched it out as being only partially\r\ntrue, or not true at all. Nothing that she could say about her studies\r\nseemed unqualifiedly true, once she put it down on paper.\r\n\r\nLate one afternoon, when she was thoroughly tired and wanted to struggle\r\non into the dusk, Harsanyi, tired too, threw up his hands and laughed at\r\nher. \"Not to-day, Miss Kronborg. That sonata will keep; it won't run\r\naway. Even if you and I should not waken up to-morrow, it will be\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\nThea turned to him fiercely. \"No, it isn't here unless I have it--not\r\nfor me,\" she cried passionately. \"Only what I hold in my two hands is\r\nthere for me!\"\r\n\r\nHarsanyi made no reply. He took a deep breath and sat down again. \"The\r\nsecond movement now, quietly, with the shoulders relaxed.\"\r\n\r\nThere were hours, too, of great exaltation; when she was at her best and\r\nbecame a part of what she was doing and ceased to exist in any other\r\nsense. There were other times when she was so shattered by ideas that\r\nshe could do nothing worth while; when they trampled over her like an\r\narmy and she felt as if she were bleeding to death under them. She\r\nsometimes came home from a late lesson so exhausted that she could eat\r\nno supper. If she tried to eat, she was ill afterward. She used to throw\r\nherself upon the bed and lie there in the dark, not thinking, not\r\nfeeling, but evaporating. That same night, perhaps, she would waken up\r\nrested and calm, and as she went over her work in her mind, the passages\r\nseemed to become something of themselves, to take a sort of pattern in\r\nthe darkness. She had never learned to work away from the piano until\r\nshe came to Harsanyi, and it helped her more than anything had ever\r\nhelped her before.\r\n\r\nShe almost never worked now with the sunny, happy contentment that had\r\nfilled the hours when she worked with Wunsch--\"like a fat horse turning\r\na sorgum mill,\" she said bitterly to herself. Then, by sticking to it,\r\nshe could always do what she set out to do. Now, everything that she\r\nreally wanted was impossible; a CANTABILE like Harsanyi's, for instance,\r\ninstead of her own cloudy tone. No use telling her she might have it in\r\nten years. She wanted it now. She wondered how she had ever found other\r\nthings interesting: books, \"Anna Karenina\"--all that seemed so unreal\r\nand on the outside of things. She was not born a musician, she decided;\r\nthere was no other way of explaining it.\r\n\r\nSometimes she got so nervous at the piano that she left it, and\r\nsnatching up her hat and cape went out and walked, hurrying through the\r\nstreets like Christian fleeing from the City of Destruction. And while\r\nshe walked she cried. There was scarcely a street in the neighborhood\r\nthat she had not cried up and down before that winter was over. The\r\nthing that used to lie under her cheek, that sat so warmly over her\r\nheart when she glided away from the sand hills that autumn morning, was\r\nfar from her. She had come to Chicago to be with it, and it had deserted\r\nher, leaving in its place a painful longing, an unresigned despair.\r\n\r\n\r\nHarsanyi knew that his interesting pupil--\"the savage blonde,\" one of\r\nhis male students called her--was sometimes very unhappy. He saw in her\r\ndiscontent a curious definition of character. He would have said that a\r\ngirl with so much musical feeling, so intelligent, with good training of\r\neye and hand, would, when thus suddenly introduced to the great\r\nliterature of the piano, have found boundless happiness. But he soon\r\nlearned that she was not able to forget her own poverty in the richness\r\nof the world he opened to her. Often when he played to her, her face was\r\nthe picture of restless misery. She would sit crouching forward, her\r\nelbows on her knees, her brows drawn together and her gray-green eyes\r\nsmaller than ever, reduced to mere pin-points of cold, piercing light.\r\nSometimes, while she listened, she would swallow hard, two or three\r\ntimes, and look nervously from left to right, drawing her shoulders\r\ntogether. \"Exactly,\" he thought, \"as if she were being watched, or as if\r\nshe were naked and heard some one coming.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when she came several times to see Mrs. Harsanyi and\r\nthe two babies, she was like a little girl, jolly and gay and eager to\r\nplay with the children, who loved her. The little daughter, Tanya, liked\r\nto touch Miss Kronborg's yellow hair and pat it, saying, \"Dolly, dolly,\"\r\nbecause it was of a color much oftener seen on dolls than on people. But\r\nif Harsanyi opened the piano and sat down to play, Miss Kronborg\r\ngradually drew away from the children, retreated to a corner and became\r\nsullen or troubled. Mrs. Harsanyi noticed this, also, and thought it\r\nvery strange behavior.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that puzzled Harsanyi was Thea's apparent lack of\r\ncuriosity. Several times he offered to give her tickets to concerts, but\r\nshe said she was too tired or that it \"knocked her out to be up late.\"\r\nHarsanyi did not know that she was singing in a choir, and had often to\r\nsing at funerals, neither did he realize how much her work with him\r\nstirred her and exhausted her. Once, just as she was leaving his studio,\r\nhe called her back and told her he could give her some tickets that had\r\nbeen sent him for Emma Juch that evening. Thea fingered the black wool\r\non the edge of her plush cape and replied, \"Oh, thank you, Mr. Harsanyi,\r\nbut I have to wash my hair to-night.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Harsanyi liked Miss Kronborg thoroughly. She saw in her the making\r\nof a pupil who would reflect credit upon Harsanyi. She felt that the\r\ngirl could be made to look strikingly handsome, and that she had the\r\nkind of personality which takes hold of audiences. Moreover, Miss\r\nKronborg was not in the least sentimental about her husband. Sometimes\r\nfrom the show pupils one had to endure a good deal. \"I like that girl,\"\r\nshe used to say, when Harsanyi told her of one of Thea's GAUCHERIES.\r\n\"She doesn't sigh every time the wind blows. With her one swallow\r\ndoesn't make a summer.\"\r\n\r\nThea told them very little about herself. She was not naturally\r\ncommunicative, and she found it hard to feel confidence in new people.\r\nShe did not know why, but she could not talk to Harsanyi as she could to\r\nDr. Archie, or to Johnny and Mrs. Tellamantez. With Mr. Larsen she felt\r\nmore at home, and when she was walking she sometimes stopped at his\r\nstudy to eat candy with him or to hear the plot of the novel he happened\r\nto be reading.\r\n\r\nOne evening toward the middle of December Thea was to dine with the\r\nHarsanyis. She arrived early, to have time to play with the children\r\nbefore they went to bed. Mrs. Harsanyi took her into her own room and\r\nhelped her take off her country \"fascinator\" and her clumsy plush cape.\r\nThea had bought this cape at a big department store and had paid $16.50\r\nfor it. As she had never paid more than ten dollars for a coat before,\r\nthat seemed to her a large price. It was very heavy and not very warm,\r\nornamented with a showy pattern in black disks, and trimmed around the\r\ncollar and the edges with some kind of black wool that \"crocked\" badly\r\nin snow or rain. It was lined with a cotton stuff called \"farmer's\r\nsatin.\" Mrs. Harsanyi was one woman in a thousand. As she lifted this\r\ncape from Thea's shoulders and laid it on her white bed, she wished that\r\nher husband did not have to charge pupils like this one for their\r\nlessons. Thea wore her Moonstone party dress, white organdie, made with\r\na \"V\" neck and elbow sleeves, and a blue sash. She looked very pretty in\r\nit, and around her throat she had a string of pink coral and tiny white\r\nshells that Ray once brought her from Los Angeles. Mrs. Harsanyi noticed\r\nthat she wore high heavy shoes which needed blacking. The choir in Mr.\r\nLarsen's church stood behind a railing, so Thea did not pay much\r\nattention to her shoes.\r\n\r\n\"You have nothing to do to your hair,\" Mrs. Harsanyi said kindly, as\r\nThea turned to the mirror. \"However it happens to lie, it's always\r\npretty. I admire it as much as Tanya does.\"\r\n\r\nThea glanced awkwardly away from her and looked stern, but Mrs. Harsanyi\r\nknew that she was pleased. They went into the living-room, behind the\r\nstudio, where the two children were playing on the big rug before the\r\ncoal grate. Andor, the boy, was six, a sturdy, handsome child, and the\r\nlittle girl was four. She came tripping to meet Thea, looking like a\r\nlittle doll in her white net dress--her mother made all her clothes.\r\nThea picked her up and hugged her. Mrs. Harsanyi excused herself and\r\nwent to the dining-room. She kept only one maid and did a good deal of\r\nthe housework herself, besides cooking her husband's favorite dishes for\r\nhim. She was still under thirty, a slender, graceful woman, gracious,\r\nintelligent, and capable. She adapted herself to circumstances with a\r\nwell-bred ease which solved many of her husband's difficulties, and kept\r\nhim, as he said, from feeling cheap and down at the heel. No musician\r\never had a better wife. Unfortunately her beauty was of a very frail and\r\nimpressionable kind, and she was beginning to lose it. Her face was too\r\nthin now, and there were often dark circles under her eyes.\r\n\r\nLeft alone with the children, Thea sat down on Tanya's little chair--she\r\nwould rather have sat on the floor, but was afraid of rumpling her\r\ndress--and helped them play \"cars\" with Andor's iron railway set. She\r\nshowed him new ways to lay his tracks and how to make switches, set up\r\nhis Noah's ark village for stations and packed the animals in the open\r\ncoal cars to send them to the stockyards. They worked out their shipment\r\nso realistically that when Andor put the two little reindeer into the\r\nstock car, Tanya snatched them out and began to cry, saying she wasn't\r\ngoing to have all their animals killed.\r\n\r\nHarsanyi came in, jaded and tired, and asked Thea to go on with her\r\ngame, as he was not equal to talking much before dinner. He sat down and\r\nmade pretense of glancing at the evening paper, but he soon dropped it.\r\nAfter the railroad began to grow tiresome, Thea went with the children\r\nto the lounge in the corner, and played for them the game with which she\r\nused to amuse Thor for hours together behind the parlor stove at home,\r\nmaking shadow pictures against the wall with her hands. Her fingers were\r\nvery supple, and she could make a duck and a cow and a sheep and a fox\r\nand a rabbit and even an elephant. Harsanyi, from his low chair, watched\r\nthem, smiling. The boy was on his knees, jumping up and down with the\r\nexcitement of guessing the beasts, and Tanya sat with her feet tucked\r\nunder her and clapped her frail little hands. Thea's profile, in the\r\nlamplight, teased his fancy. Where had he seen a head like it before?\r\n\r\nWhen dinner was announced, little Andor took Thea's hand and walked to\r\nthe dining-room with her. The children always had dinner with their\r\nparents and behaved very nicely at table. \"Mamma,\" said Andor seriously\r\nas he climbed into his chair and tucked his napkin into the collar of\r\nhis blouse, \"Miss Kronborg's hands are every kind of animal there is.\"\r\n\r\nHis father laughed. \"I wish somebody would say that about my hands,\r\nAndor.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Thea dined at the Harsanyis before, she noticed that there was an\r\nintense suspense from the moment they took their places at the table\r\nuntil the master of the house had tasted the soup. He had a theory that\r\nif the soup went well, the dinner would go well; but if the soup was\r\npoor, all was lost. To-night he tasted his soup and smiled, and Mrs.\r\nHarsanyi sat more easily in her chair and turned her attention to Thea.\r\nThea loved their dinner table, because it was lighted by candles in\r\nsilver candle-sticks, and she had never seen a table so lighted anywhere\r\nelse. There were always flowers, too. To-night there was a little orange\r\ntree, with oranges on it, that one of Harsanyi's pupils had sent him at\r\nThanksgiving time. After Harsanyi had finished his soup and a glass of\r\nred Hungarian wine, he lost his fagged look and became cordial and\r\nwitty. He persuaded Thea to drink a little wine to-night. The first time\r\nshe dined with them, when he urged her to taste the glass of sherry\r\nbeside her plate, she astonished them by telling them that she \"never\r\ndrank.\"\r\n\r\nHarsanyi was then a man of thirty-two. He was to have a very brilliant\r\ncareer, but he did not know it then. Theodore Thomas was perhaps the\r\nonly man in Chicago who felt that Harsanyi might have a great future.\r\nHarsanyi belonged to the softer Slavic type, and was more like a Pole\r\nthan a Hungarian. He was tall, slender, active, with sloping, graceful\r\nshoulders and long arms. His head was very fine, strongly and delicately\r\nmodelled, and, as Thea put it, \"so independent.\" A lock of his thick\r\nbrown hair usually hung over his forehead. His eye was wonderful; full\r\nof light and fire when he was interested, soft and thoughtful when he\r\nwas tired or melancholy. The meaning and power of two very fine eyes\r\nmust all have gone into this one--the right one, fortunately, the one\r\nnext his audience when he played. He believed that the glass eye which\r\ngave one side of his face such a dull, blind look, had ruined his\r\ncareer, or rather had made a career impossible for him. Harsanyi lost\r\nhis eye when he was twelve years old, in a Pennsylvania mining town\r\nwhere explosives happened to be kept too near the frame shanties in\r\nwhich the company packed newly arrived Hungarian families.\r\n\r\nHis father was a musician and a good one, but he had cruelly over-worked\r\nthe boy; keeping him at the piano for six hours a day and making him\r\nplay in cafes and dance halls for half the night. Andor ran away and\r\ncrossed the ocean with an uncle, who smuggled him through the port as\r\none of his own many children. The explosion in which Andor was hurt\r\nkilled a score of people, and he was thought lucky to get off with an\r\neye. He still had a clipping from a Pittsburg paper, giving a list of\r\nthe dead and injured. He appeared as \"Harsanyi, Andor, left eye and\r\nslight injuries about the head.\" That was his first American \"notice\";\r\nand he kept it. He held no grudge against the coal company; he\r\nunderstood that the accident was merely one of the things that are bound\r\nto happen in the general scramble of American life, where every one\r\ncomes to grab and takes his chance.\r\n\r\nWhile they were eating dessert, Thea asked Harsanyi if she could change\r\nher Tuesday lesson from afternoon to morning. \"I have to be at a choir\r\nrehearsal in the afternoon, to get ready for the Christmas music, and I\r\nexpect it will last until late.\"\r\n\r\nHarsanyi put down his fork and looked up. \"A choir rehearsal? You sing\r\nin a church?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. A little Swedish church, over on the North side.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you not tell us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm only a temporary. The regular soprano is not well.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long have you been singing there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ever since I came. I had to get a position of some kind,\" Thea\r\nexplained, flushing, \"and the preacher took me on. He runs the choir\r\nhimself. He knew my father, and I guess he took me to oblige.\"\r\n\r\nHarsanyi tapped the tablecloth with the ends of his fingers. \"But why\r\ndid you never tell us? Why are you so reticent with us?\"\r\n\r\nThea looked shyly at him from under her brows. \"Well, it's certainly not\r\nvery interesting. It's only a little church. I only do it for business\r\nreasons.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean? Don't you like to sing? Don't you sing well?\"\r\n\r\n\"I like it well enough, but, of course, I don't know anything about\r\nsinging. I guess that's why I never said anything about it. Anybody\r\nthat's got a voice can sing in a little church like that.\"\r\n\r\nHarsanyi laughed softly--a little scornfully, Thea thought. \"So you have\r\na voice, have you?\"\r\n\r\nThea hesitated, looked intently at the candles and then at Harsanyi.\r\n\"Yes,\" she said firmly; \"I have got some, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good girl,\" said Mrs. Harsanyi, nodding and smiling at Thea. \"You must\r\nlet us hear you sing after dinner.\"\r\n\r\nThis remark seemingly closed the subject, and when the coffee was\r\nbrought they began to talk of other things. Harsanyi asked Thea how she\r\nhappened to know so much about the way in which freight trains are\r\noperated, and she tried to give him some idea of how the people in\r\nlittle desert towns live by the railway and order their lives by the\r\ncoming and going of the trains. When they left the diningroom the\r\nchildren were sent to bed and Mrs. Harsanyi took Thea into the studio.\r\nShe and her husband usually sat there in the evening.\r\n\r\nAlthough their apartment seemed so elegant to Thea, it was small and\r\ncramped. The studio was the only spacious room. The Harsanyis were poor,\r\nand it was due to Mrs. Harsanyi's good management that their lives, even\r\nin hard times, moved along with dignity and order. She had long ago\r\nfound out that bills or debts of any kind frightened her husband and\r\ncrippled his working power. He said they were like bars on the windows,\r\nand shut out the future; they meant that just so many hundred dollars'\r\nworth of his life was debilitated and exhausted before he got to it. So\r\nMrs. Harsanyi saw to it that they never owed anything. Harsanyi was not\r\nextravagant, though he was sometimes careless about money. Quiet and\r\norder and his wife's good taste were the things that meant most to him.\r\nAfter these, good food, good cigars, a little good wine. He wore his\r\nclothes until they were shabby, until his wife had to ask the tailor to\r\ncome to the house and measure him for new ones. His neckties she usually\r\nmade herself, and when she was in shops she always kept her eye open for\r\nsilks in very dull or pale shades, grays and olives, warm blacks and\r\nbrowns.\r\n\r\nWhen they went into the studio Mrs. Harsanyi took up her embroidery and\r\nThea sat down beside her on a low stool, her hands clasped about her\r\nknees. While his wife and his pupil talked, Harsanyi sank into a CHAISE\r\nLONGUE in which he sometimes snatched a few moments' rest between his\r\nlessons, and smoked. He sat well out of the circle of the lamplight, his\r\nfeet to the fire. His feet were slender and well shaped, always\r\nelegantly shod. Much of the grace of his movements was due to the fact\r\nthat his feet were almost as sure and flexible as his hands. He listened\r\nto the conversation with amusement. He admired his wife's tact and\r\nkindness with crude young people; she taught them so much without\r\nseeming to be instructing. When the clock struck nine, Thea said she\r\nmust be going home.\r\n\r\nHarsanyi rose and flung away his cigarette. \"Not yet. We have just begun\r\nthe evening. Now you are going to sing for us. I have been waiting for\r\nyou to recover from dinner. Come, what shall it be?\" he crossed to the\r\npiano.\r\n\r\nThea laughed and shook her head, locking her elbows still tighter about\r\nher knees. \"Thank you, Mr. Harsanyi, but if you really make me sing,\r\nI'll accompany myself. You couldn't stand it to play the sort of things\r\nI have to sing.\"\r\n\r\nAs Harsanyi still pointed to the chair at the piano, she left her stool\r\nand went to it, while he returned to his CHAISE LONGUE. Thea looked at\r\nthe keyboard uneasily for a moment, then she began \"Come, ye\r\nDisconsolate,\" the hymn Wunsch had always liked to hear her sing. Mrs.\r\nHarsanyi glanced questioningly at her husband, but he was looking\r\nintently at the toes of his boots, shading his forehead with his long\r\nwhite hand. When Thea finished the hymn she did not turn around, but\r\nimmediately began \"The Ninety and Nine.\" Mrs. Harsanyi kept trying to\r\ncatch her husband's eye; but his chin only sank lower on his collar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There were ninety and nine that safely lay In the shelter of the fold,\r\nBut one was out on the hills away, Far off from the gates of gold.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHarsanyi looked at her, then back at the fire.\r\n\r\n\"Rejoice, for the Shepherd has found his sheep.\"\r\n\r\nThea turned on the chair and grinned. \"That's about enough, isn't it?\r\nThat song got me my job. The preacher said it was sympathetic,\" she\r\nminced the word, remembering Mr. Larsen's manner.\r\n\r\nHarsanyi drew himself up in his chair, resting his elbows on the low\r\narms. \"Yes? That is better suited to your voice. Your upper tones are\r\ngood, above G. I must teach you some songs. Don't you know\r\nanything--pleasant?\"\r\n\r\nThea shook her head ruefully. \"I'm afraid I don't. Let me see--Perhaps,\"\r\nshe turned to the piano and put her hands on the keys. \"I used to sing\r\nthis for Mr. Wunsch a long while ago. It's for contralto, but I'll try\r\nit.\" She frowned at the keyboard a moment, played the few introductory\r\nmeasures, and began:\r\n\r\n\"ACH, ICH HABE SIE VERLOREN,\"\r\n\r\nShe had not sung it for a long time, and it came back like an old\r\nfriendship. When she finished, Harsanyi sprang from his chair and\r\ndropped lightly upon his toes, a kind of ENTRE-CHAT that he sometimes\r\nexecuted when he formed a sudden resolution, or when he was about to\r\nfollow a pure intuition, against reason. His wife said that when he gave\r\nthat spring he was shot from the bow of his ancestors, and now when he\r\nleft his chair in that manner she knew he was intensely interested. He\r\nwent quickly to the piano.\r\n\r\n\"Sing that again. There is nothing the matter with your low voice, my\r\ngirl. I will play for you. Let your voice out.\" Without looking at her\r\nhe began the accompaniment. Thea drew back her shoulders, relaxed them\r\ninstinctively, and sang.\r\n\r\nWhen she finished the aria, Harsanyi beckoned her nearer. \"Sing AH--AH\r\nfor me, as I indicate.\" He kept his right hand on the keyboard and put\r\nhis left to her throat, placing the tips of his delicate fingers over\r\nher larynx. \"Again,--until your breath is gone.--Trill between the two\r\ntones, always; good! Again; excellent!--Now up,--stay there. E and F.\r\nNot so good, is it? F is always a hard one.--Now, try the\r\nhalf-tone.--That's right, nothing difficult about it.--Now, pianissimo,\r\nAH--AH. Now, swell it, AH--AH.--Again, follow my hand.--Now, carry it\r\ndown.--Anybody ever tell you anything about your breathing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Larsen says I have an unusually long breath,\" Thea replied with\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nHarsanyi smiled. \"So you have, so you have. That was what I meant. Now,\r\nonce more; carry it up and then down, AH--AH.\" He put his hand back to\r\nher throat and sat with his head bent, his one eye closed. He loved to\r\nhear a big voice throb in a relaxed, natural throat, and he was thinking\r\nthat no one had ever felt this voice vibrate before. It was like a wild\r\nbird that had flown into his studio on Middleton Street from goodness\r\nknew how far! No one knew that it had come, or even that it existed;\r\nleast of all the strange, crude girl in whose throat it beat its\r\npassionate wings. What a simple thing it was, he reflected; why had he\r\nnever guessed it before? Everything about her indicated it,--the big\r\nmouth, the wide jaw and chin, the strong white teeth, the deep laugh.\r\nThe machine was so simple and strong, seemed to be so easily operated.\r\nShe sang from the bottom of herself. Her breath came from down where her\r\nlaugh came from, the deep laugh which Mrs. Harsanyi had once called \"the\r\nlaugh of the people.\" A relaxed throat, a voice that lay on the breath,\r\nthat had never been forced off the breath; it rose and fell in the\r\nair-column like the little balls which are put to shine in the jet of a\r\nfountain. The voice did not thin as it went up; the upper tones were as\r\nfull and rich as the lower, produced in the same way and as\r\nunconsciously, only with deeper breath.\r\n\r\nAt last Harsanyi threw back his head and rose. \"You must be tired, Miss\r\nKronborg.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she replied, she startled him; he had forgotten how hard and full\r\nof burs her speaking voice was. \"No,\" she said, \"singing never tires\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nHarsanyi pushed back his hair with a nervous hand. \"I don't know much\r\nabout the voice, but I shall take liberties and teach you some good\r\nsongs. I think you have a very interesting voice.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad if you like it. Good-night, Mr. Harsanyi.\" Thea went with Mrs.\r\nHarsanyi to get her wraps.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Harsanyi came back to her husband, she found him walking\r\nrestlessly up and down the room.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think her voice wonderful, dear?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I scarcely know what to think. All I really know about that girl is\r\nthat she tires me to death. We must not have her often. If I did not\r\nhave my living to make, then--\" he dropped into a chair and closed his\r\neyes. \"How tired I am. What a voice!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAFTER that evening Thea's work with Harsanyi changed somewhat. He\r\ninsisted that she should study some songs with him, and after almost\r\nevery lesson he gave up half an hour of his own time to practicing them\r\nwith her. He did not pretend to know much about voice production, but so\r\nfar, he thought, she had acquired no really injurious habits. A healthy\r\nand powerful organ had found its own method, which was not a bad one. He\r\nwished to find out a good deal before he recommended a vocal teacher. He\r\nnever told Thea what he thought about her voice, and made her general\r\nignorance of anything worth singing his pretext for the trouble he took.\r\nThat was in the beginning. After the first few lessons his own pleasure\r\nand hers were pretext enough. The singing came at the end of the lesson\r\nhour, and they both treated it as a form of relaxation.\r\n\r\nHarsanyi did not say much even to his wife about his discovery. He\r\nbrooded upon it in a curious way. He found that these unscientific\r\nsinging lessons stimulated him in his own study. After Miss Kronborg\r\nleft him he often lay down in his studio for an hour before dinner, with\r\nhis head full of musical ideas, with an effervescence in his brain which\r\nhe had sometimes lost for weeks together under the grind of teaching. He\r\nhad never got so much back for himself from any pupil as he did from\r\nMiss Kronborg. From the first she had stimulated him; something in her\r\npersonality invariably affected him. Now that he was feeling his way\r\ntoward her voice, he found her more interesting than ever before. She\r\nlifted the tedium of the winter for him, gave him curious fancies and\r\nreveries. Musically, she was sympathetic to him. Why all this was true,\r\nhe never asked himself. He had learned that one must take where and when\r\none can the mysterious mental irritant that rouses one's imagination;\r\nthat it is not to be had by order. She often wearied him, but she never\r\nbored him. Under her crudeness and brusque hardness, he felt there was a\r\nnature quite different, of which he never got so much as a hint except\r\nwhen she was at the piano, or when she sang. It was toward this hidden\r\ncreature that he was trying, for his own pleasure, to find his way. In\r\nshort, Harsanyi looked forward to his hour with Thea for the same reason\r\nthat poor Wunsch had sometimes dreaded his; because she stirred him more\r\nthan anything she did could adequately explain.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon Harsanyi, after the lesson, was standing by the window\r\nputting some collodion on a cracked finger, and Thea was at the piano\r\ntrying over \"Die Lorelei\" which he had given her last week to practice.\r\nIt was scarcely a song which a singing master would have given her, but\r\nhe had his own reasons. How she sang it mattered only to him and to her.\r\nHe was playing his own game now, without interference; he suspected that\r\nhe could not do so always.\r\n\r\nWhen she finished the song, she looked back over her shoulder at him and\r\nspoke thoughtfully. \"That wasn't right, at the end, was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, that should be an open, flowing tone, something like this,\"--he\r\nwaved his fingers rapidly in the air. \"You get the idea?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't. Seems a queer ending, after the rest.\"\r\n\r\nHarsanyi corked his little bottle and dropped it into the pocket of his\r\nvelvet coat. \"Why so? Shipwrecks come and go, MARCHEN come and go, but\r\nthe river keeps right on. There you have your open, flowing tone.\"\r\n\r\nThea looked intently at the music. \"I see,\" she said dully. \"Oh, I see!\"\r\nshe repeated quickly and turned to him a glowing countenance. \"It is the\r\nriver.--Oh, yes, I get it now!\" She looked at him but long enough to\r\ncatch his glance, then turned to the piano again. Harsanyi was never\r\nquite sure where the light came from when her face suddenly flashed out\r\nat him in that way. Her eyes were too small to account for it, though\r\nthey glittered like green ice in the sun. At such moments her hair was\r\nyellower, her skin whiter, her cheeks pinker, as if a lamp had suddenly\r\nbeen turned up inside of her. She went at the song again:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"ICH WEISS NICHT, WAS SOLL ES BEDEUTEN, DAS ICH SO TRAURIG BIN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA kind of happiness vibrated in her voice. Harsanyi noticed how much and\r\nhow unhesitatingly she changed her delivery of the whole song, the first\r\npart as well as the last. He had often noticed that she could not think\r\na thing out in passages. Until she saw it as a whole, she wandered like\r\na blind man surrounded by torments. After she once had her \"revelation,\"\r\nafter she got the idea that to her--not always to him--explained\r\neverything, then she went forward rapidly. But she was not always easy\r\nto help. She was sometimes impervious to suggestion; she would stare at\r\nhim as if she were deaf and ignore everything he told her to do. Then,\r\nall at once, something would happen in her brain and she would begin to\r\ndo all that he had been for weeks telling her to do, without realizing\r\nthat he had ever told her.\r\n\r\nTo-night Thea forgot Harsanyi and his finger. She finished the song only\r\nto begin it with fresh enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"UND DAS HAT MIT IHREM SINGEN DIE LORELEI GETHAN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nShe sat there singing it until the darkening room was so flooded with it\r\nthat Harsanyi threw open a window.\r\n\r\n\"You really must stop it, Miss Kronborg. I shan't be able to get it out\r\nof my head to-night.\"\r\n\r\nThea laughed tolerantly as she began to gather up her music. \"Why, I\r\nthought you had gone, Mr. Harsanyi. I like that song.\"\r\n\r\nThat evening at dinner Harsanyi sat looking intently into a glass of\r\nheavy yellow wine; boring into it, indeed, with his one eye, when his\r\nface suddenly broke into a smile.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Andor?\" his wife asked.\r\n\r\nHe smiled again, this time at her, and took up the nutcrackers and a\r\nBrazil nut. \"Do you know,\" he said in a tone so intimate and\r\nconfidential that he might have been speaking to himself,--\"do you know,\r\nI like to see Miss Kronborg get hold of an idea. In spite of being so\r\ntalented, she's not quick. But when she does get an idea, it fills her\r\nup to the eyes. She had my room so reeking of a song this afternoon that\r\nI couldn't stay there.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Harsanyi looked up quickly, \"'Die Lorelei,' you mean? One couldn't\r\nthink of anything else anywhere in the house. I thought she was\r\npossessed. But don't you think her voice is wonderful sometimes?\"\r\n\r\nHarsanyi tasted his wine slowly. \"My dear, I've told you before that I\r\ndon't know what I think about Miss Kronborg, except that I'm glad there\r\nare not two of her. I sometimes wonder whether she is not glad. Fresh as\r\nshe is at it all, I've occasionally fancied that, if she knew how, she\r\nwould like to--diminish.\" He moved his left hand out into the air as if\r\nhe were suggesting a DIMINUENDO to an orchestra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nBY the first of February Thea had been in Chicago almost four months,\r\nand she did not know much more about the city than if she had never\r\nquitted Moonstone. She was, as Harsanyi said, incurious. Her work took\r\nmost of her time, and she found that she had to sleep a good deal. It\r\nhad never before been so hard to get up in the morning. She had the\r\nbother of caring for her room, and she had to build her fire and bring\r\nup her coal. Her routine was frequently interrupted by a message from\r\nMr. Larsen summoning her to sing at a funeral. Every funeral took half a\r\nday, and the time had to be made up. When Mrs. Harsanyi asked her if it\r\ndid not depress her to sing at funerals, she replied that she \"had been\r\nbrought up to go to funerals and didn't mind.\"\r\n\r\nThea never went into shops unless she had to, and she felt no interest\r\nin them. Indeed, she shunned them, as places where one was sure to be\r\nparted from one's money in some way. She was nervous about counting her\r\nchange, and she could not accustom herself to having her purchases sent\r\nto her address. She felt much safer with her bundles under her arm.\r\n\r\nDuring this first winter Thea got no city consciousness. Chicago was\r\nsimply a wilderness through which one had to find one's way. She felt no\r\ninterest in the general briskness and zest of the crowds. The crash and\r\nscramble of that big, rich, appetent Western city she did not take in at\r\nall, except to notice that the noise of the drays and street-cars tired\r\nher. The brilliant window displays, the splendid furs and stuffs, the\r\ngorgeous flower-shops, the gay candy-shops, she scarcely noticed. At\r\nChristmas-time she did feel some curiosity about the toy-stores, and she\r\nwished she held Thor's little mittened fist in her hand as she stood\r\nbefore the windows. The jewelers' windows, too, had a strong attraction\r\nfor her--she had always liked bright stones. When she went into the city\r\nshe used to brave the biting lake winds and stand gazing in at the\r\ndisplays of diamonds and pearls and emeralds; the tiaras and necklaces\r\nand earrings, on white velvet. These seemed very well worth while to\r\nher, things worth coveting.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lorch and Mrs. Andersen often told each other it was strange that\r\nMiss Kronborg had so little initiative about \"visiting points of\r\ninterest.\" When Thea came to live with them she had expressed a wish to\r\nsee two places: Montgomery Ward and Company's big mail-order store, and\r\nthe packing-houses, to which all the hogs and cattle that went through\r\nMoonstone were bound. One of Mrs. Lorch's lodgers worked in a\r\npacking-house, and Mrs. Andersen brought Thea word that she had spoken\r\nto Mr. Eckman and he would gladly take her to Packingtown. Eckman was a\r\ntoughish young Swede, and he thought it would be something of a lark to\r\ntake a pretty girl through the slaughter-houses. But he was\r\ndisappointed. Thea neither grew faint nor clung to the arm he kept\r\noffering her. She asked innumerable questions and was impatient because\r\nhe knew so little of what was going on outside of his own department.\r\nWhen they got off the street-car and walked back to Mrs. Lorch's house\r\nin the dusk, Eckman put her hand in his overcoat pocket--she had no\r\nmuff--and kept squeezing it ardently until she said, \"Don't do that; my\r\nring cuts me.\" That night he told his roommate that he \"could have\r\nkissed her as easy as rolling off a log, but she wasn't worth the\r\ntrouble.\" As for Thea, she had enjoyed the afternoon very much, and\r\nwrote her father a brief but clear account of what she had seen.\r\n\r\nOne night at supper Mrs. Andersen was talking about the exhibit of\r\nstudents' work she had seen at the Art Institute that afternoon. Several\r\nof her friends had sketches in the exhibit. Thea, who always felt that\r\nshe was behindhand in courtesy to Mrs. Andersen, thought that here was\r\nan opportunity to show interest without committing herself to anything.\r\n\"Where is that, the Institute?\" she asked absently.\r\n\r\nMrs. Andersen clasped her napkin in both hands. \"The Art Institute? Our\r\nbeautiful Art Institute on Michigan Avenue? Do you mean to say you have\r\nnever visited it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, is it the place with the big lions out in front? I remember; I saw\r\nit when I went to Montgomery Ward's. Yes, I thought the lions were\r\nbeautiful.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the pictures! Didn't you visit the galleries?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. The sign outside said it was a pay-day. I've always meant to go\r\nback, but I haven't happened to be down that way since.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lorch and Mrs. Andersen looked at each other. The old mother spoke,\r\nfixing her shining little eyes upon Thea across the table. \"Ah, but Miss\r\nKronborg, there are old masters! Oh, many of them, such as you could not\r\nsee anywhere out of Europe.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Corots,\" breathed Mrs. Andersen, tilting her head feelingly. \"Such\r\nexamples of the Barbizon school!\" This was meaningless to Thea, who did\r\nnot read the art columns of the Sunday INTER-OCEAN as Mrs. Andersen did.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm going there some day,\" she reassured them. \"I like to look at\r\noil paintings.\"\r\n\r\nOne bleak day in February, when the wind was blowing clouds of dirt like\r\na Moonstone sandstorm, dirt that filled your eyes and ears and mouth,\r\nThea fought her way across the unprotected space in front of the Art\r\nInstitute and into the doors of the building. She did not come out again\r\nuntil the closing hour. In the street-car, on the long cold ride home,\r\nwhile she sat staring at the waistcoat buttons of a fat strap-hanger,\r\nshe had a serious reckoning with herself. She seldom thought about her\r\nway of life, about what she ought or ought not to do; usually there was\r\nbut one obvious and important thing to be done. But that afternoon she\r\nremonstrated with herself severely. She told herself that she was\r\nmissing a great deal; that she ought to be more willing to take advice\r\nand to go to see things. She was sorry that she had let months pass\r\nwithout going to the Art Institute. After this she would go once a week.\r\n\r\nThe Institute proved, indeed, a place of retreat, as the sand hills or\r\nthe Kohlers' garden used to be; a place where she could forget Mrs.\r\nAndersen's tiresome overtures of friendship, the stout contralto in the\r\nchoir whom she so unreasonably hated, and even, for a little while, the\r\ntorment of her work. That building was a place in which she could relax\r\nand play, and she could hardly ever play now. On the whole, she spent\r\nmore time with the casts than with the pictures. They were at once more\r\nsimple and more perplexing; and some way they seemed more important,\r\nharder to overlook. It never occurred to her to buy a catalogue, so she\r\ncalled most of the casts by names she made up for them. Some of them she\r\nknew; the Dying Gladiator she had read about in \"Childe Harold\" almost\r\nas long ago as she could remember; he was strongly associated with Dr.\r\nArchie and childish illnesses. The Venus di Milo puzzled her; she could\r\nnot see why people thought her so beautiful. She told herself over and\r\nover that she did not think the Apollo Belvedere \"at all handsome.\"\r\nBetter than anything else she liked a great equestrian statue of an\r\nevil, cruel-looking general with an unpronounceable name. She used to\r\nwalk round and round this terrible man and his terrible horse, frowning\r\nat him, brooding upon him, as if she had to make some momentous decision\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\nThe casts, when she lingered long among them, always made her gloomy. It\r\nwas with a lightening of the heart, a feeling of throwing off the old\r\nmiseries and old sorrows of the world, that she ran up the wide\r\nstaircase to the pictures. There she liked best the ones that told\r\nstories. There was a painting by Gerome called \"The Pasha's Grief\" which\r\nalways made her wish for Gunner and Axel. The Pasha was seated on a rug,\r\nbeside a green candle almost as big as a telegraph pole, and before him\r\nwas stretched his dead tiger, a splendid beast, and there were pink\r\nroses scattered about him. She loved, too, a picture of some boys\r\nbringing in a newborn calf on a litter, the cow walking beside it and\r\nlicking it. The Corot which hung next to this painting she did not like\r\nor dislike; she never saw it.\r\n\r\nBut in that same room there was a picture--oh, that was the thing she\r\nran upstairs so fast to see! That was her picture. She imagined that\r\nnobody cared for it but herself, and that it waited for her. That was a\r\npicture indeed. She liked even the name of it, \"The Song of the Lark.\"\r\nThe flat country, the early morning light, the wet fields, the look in\r\nthe girl's heavy face--well, they were all hers, anyhow, whatever was\r\nthere. She told herself that that picture was \"right.\" Just what she\r\nmeant by this, it would take a clever person to explain. But to her the\r\nword covered the almost boundless satisfaction she felt when she looked\r\nat the picture.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Thea had any idea how fast the weeks were flying, before Mr.\r\nLarsen's \"permanent\" soprano had returned to her duties, spring came;\r\nwindy, dusty, strident, shrill; a season almost more violent in Chicago\r\nthan the winter from which it releases one, or the heat to which it\r\neventually delivers one. One sunny morning the apple trees in Mrs.\r\nLorch's back yard burst into bloom, and for the first time in months\r\nThea dressed without building a fire. The morning shone like a holiday,\r\nand for her it was to be a holiday. There was in the air that sudden,\r\ntreacherous softness which makes the Poles who work in the\r\npacking-houses get drunk. At such times beauty is necessary, and in\r\nPackingtown there is no place to get it except at the saloons, where one\r\ncan buy for a few hours the illusion of comfort, hope, love,--whatever\r\none most longs for.\r\n\r\nHarsanyi had given Thea a ticket for the symphony concert that\r\nafternoon, and when she looked out at the white apple trees her doubts\r\nas to whether she ought to go vanished at once. She would make her work\r\nlight that morning, she told herself. She would go to the concert full\r\nof energy. When she set off, after dinner, Mrs. Lorch, who knew Chicago\r\nweather, prevailed upon her to take her cape. The old lady said that\r\nsuch sudden mildness, so early in April, presaged a sharp return of\r\nwinter, and she was anxious about her apple trees.\r\n\r\nThe concert began at two-thirty, and Thea was in her seat in the\r\nAuditorium at ten minutes after two--a fine seat in the first row of the\r\nbalcony, on the side, where she could see the house as well as the\r\norchestra. She had been to so few concerts that the great house, the\r\ncrowd of people, and the lights, all had a stimulating effect. She was\r\nsurprised to see so many men in the audience, and wondered how they\r\ncould leave their business in the afternoon. During the first number\r\nThea was so much interested in the orchestra itself, in the men, the\r\ninstruments, the volume of sound, that she paid little attention to what\r\nthey were playing. Her excitement impaired her power of listening. She\r\nkept saying to herself, \"Now I must stop this foolishness and listen; I\r\nmay never hear this again\"; but her mind was like a glass that is hard\r\nto focus. She was not ready to listen until the second number, Dvorak's\r\nSymphony in E minor, called on the programme, \"From the New World.\" The\r\nfirst theme had scarcely been given out when her mind became clear;\r\ninstant composure fell upon her, and with it came the power of\r\nconcentration. This was music she could understand, music from the New\r\nWorld indeed! Strange how, as the first movement went on, it brought\r\nback to her that high tableland above Laramie; the grass-grown wagon\r\ntrails, the far-away peaks of the snowy range, the wind and the eagles,\r\nthat old man and the first telegraph message.\r\n\r\nWhen the first movement ended, Thea's hands and feet were cold as ice.\r\nShe was too much excited to know anything except that she wanted\r\nsomething desperately, and when the English horns gave out the theme of\r\nthe Largo, she knew that what she wanted was exactly that. Here were the\r\nsand hills, the grasshoppers and locusts, all the things that wakened\r\nand chirped in the early morning; the reaching and reaching of high\r\nplains, the immeasurable yearning of all flat lands. There was home in\r\nit, too; first memories, first mornings long ago; the amazement of a new\r\nsoul in a new world; a soul new and yet old, that had dreamed something\r\ndespairing, something glorious, in the dark before it was born; a soul\r\nobsessed by what it did not know, under the cloud of a past it could not\r\nrecall.\r\n\r\nIf Thea had had much experience in concert-going, and had known her own\r\ncapacity, she would have left the hall when the symphony was over. But\r\nshe sat still, scarcely knowing where she was, because her mind had been\r\nfar away and had not yet come back to her. She was startled when the\r\norchestra began to play again--the entry of the gods into Walhalla. She\r\nheard it as people hear things in their sleep. She knew scarcely\r\nanything about the Wagner operas. She had a vague idea that \"Rhinegold\"\r\nwas about the strife between gods and men; she had read something about\r\nit in Mr. Haweis's book long ago. Too tired to follow the orchestra with\r\nmuch understanding, she crouched down in her seat and closed her eyes.\r\nThe cold, stately measures of the Walhalla music rang out, far away; the\r\nrainbow bridge throbbed out into the air, under it the wailing of the\r\nRhine daughters and the singing of the Rhine. But Thea was sunk in\r\ntwilight; it was all going on in another world. So it happened that with\r\na dull, almost listless ear she heard for the first time that troubled\r\nmusic, ever-darkening, ever-brightening, which was to flow through so\r\nmany years of her life.\r\n\r\nWhen Thea emerged from the concert hall, Mrs. Lorch's predictions had\r\nbeen fulfilled. A furious gale was beating over the city from Lake\r\nMichigan. The streets were full of cold, hurrying, angry people, running\r\nfor street-cars and barking at each other. The sun was setting in a\r\nclear, windy sky, that flamed with red as if there were a great fire\r\nsomewhere on the edge of the city. For almost the first time Thea was\r\nconscious of the city itself, of the congestion of life all about her,\r\nof the brutality and power of those streams that flowed in the streets,\r\nthreatening to drive one under. People jostled her, ran into her, poked\r\nher aside with their elbows, uttering angry exclamations. She got on the\r\nwrong car and was roughly ejected by the conductor at a windy corner, in\r\nfront of a saloon. She stood there dazed and shivering. The cars passed,\r\nscreaming as they rounded curves, but either they were full to the\r\ndoors, or were bound for places where she did not want to go. Her hands\r\nwere so cold that she took off her tight kid gloves. The street lights\r\nbegan to gleam in the dusk. A young man came out of the saloon and stood\r\neyeing her questioningly while he lit a cigarette. \"Looking for a friend\r\nto-night?\" he asked. Thea drew up the collar of her cape and walked on a\r\nfew paces. The young man shrugged his shoulders and drifted away.\r\n\r\nThea came back to the corner and stood there irresolutely. An old man\r\napproached her. He, too, seemed to be waiting for a car. He wore an\r\novercoat with a black fur collar, his gray mustache was waxed into\r\nlittle points, and his eyes were watery. He kept thrusting his face up\r\nnear hers. Her hat blew off and he ran after it--a stiff, pitiful skip\r\nhe had--and brought it back to her. Then, while she was pinning her hat\r\non, her cape blew up, and he held it down for her, looking at her\r\nintently. His face worked as if he were going to cry or were frightened.\r\nHe leaned over and whispered something to her. It struck her as curious\r\nthat he was really quite timid, like an old beggar. \"Oh, let me ALONE!\"\r\nshe cried miserably between her teeth. He vanished, disappeared like the\r\nDevil in a play. But in the mean time something had got away from her;\r\nshe could not remember how the violins came in after the horns, just\r\nthere. When her cape blew up, perhaps--Why did these men torment her? A\r\ncloud of dust blew in her face and blinded her. There was some power\r\nabroad in the world bent upon taking away from her that feeling with\r\nwhich she had come out of the concert hall. Everything seemed to sweep\r\ndown on her to tear it out from under her cape. If one had that, the\r\nworld became one's enemy; people, buildings, wagons, cars, rushed at one\r\nto crush it under, to make one let go of it. Thea glared round her at\r\nthe crowds, the ugly, sprawling streets, the long lines of lights, and\r\nshe was not crying now. Her eyes were brighter than even Harsanyi had\r\never seen them. All these things and people were no longer remote and\r\nnegligible; they had to be met, they were lined up against her, they\r\nwere there to take something from her. Very well; they should never have\r\nit. They might trample her to death, but they should never have it. As\r\nlong as she lived that ecstasy was going to be hers. She would live for\r\nit, work for it, die for it; but she was going to have it, time after\r\ntime, height after height. She could hear the crash of the orchestra\r\nagain, and she rose on the brasses. She would have it, what the trumpets\r\nwere singing! She would have it, have it,--it! Under the old cape she\r\npressed her hands upon her heaving bosom, that was a little girl's no\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nONE afternoon in April, Theodore Thomas, the conductor of the Chicago\r\nSymphony Orchestra, had turned out his desk light and was about to leave\r\nhis office in the Auditorium Building, when Harsanyi appeared in the\r\ndoorway. The conductor welcomed him with a hearty hand-grip and threw\r\noff the overcoat he had just put on. He pushed Harsanyi into a chair and\r\nsat down at his burdened desk, pointing to the piles of papers and\r\nrailway folders upon it.\r\n\r\n\"Another tour, clear to the coast. This traveling is the part of my work\r\nthat grinds me, Andor. You know what it means: bad food, dirt, noise,\r\nexhaustion for the men and for me. I'm not so young as I once was. It's\r\ntime I quit the highway. This is the last tour, I swear!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'm sorry for the 'highway.' I remember when I first heard you in\r\nPittsburg, long ago. It was a life-line you threw me. It's about one of\r\nthe people along your highway that I've come to see you. Whom do you\r\nconsider the best teacher for voice in Chicago?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas frowned and pulled his heavy mustache. \"Let me see; I suppose\r\non the whole Madison Bowers is the best. He's intelligent, and he had\r\ngood training. I don't like him.\"\r\n\r\nHarsanyi nodded. \"I thought there was no one else. I don't like him,\r\neither, so I hesitated. But I suppose he must do, for the present.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you found anything promising? One of your own students?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. A young Swedish girl from somewhere in Colorado. She is very\r\ntalented, and she seems to me to have a remarkable voice.\"\r\n\r\n\"High voice?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it will be; though her low voice has a beautiful quality, very\r\nindividual. She has had no instruction in voice at all, and I shrink\r\nfrom handing her over to anybody; her own instinct about it has been so\r\ngood. It is one of those voices that manages itself easily, without\r\nthinning as it goes up; good breathing and perfect relaxation. But she\r\nmust have a teacher, of course. There is a break in the middle voice, so\r\nthat the voice does not all work together; an unevenness.\"\r\n\r\nThomas looked up. \"So? Curious; that cleft often happens with the\r\nSwedes. Some of their best singers have had it. It always reminds me of\r\nthe space you so often see between their front teeth. Is she strong\r\nphysically?\"\r\n\r\nHarsanyi's eye flashed. He lifted his hand before him and clenched it.\r\n\"Like a horse, like a tree! Every time I give her a lesson, I lose a\r\npound. She goes after what she wants.\"\r\n\r\n\"Intelligent, you say? Musically intelligent?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but no cultivation whatever. She came to me like a fine young\r\nsavage, a book with nothing written in it. That is why I feel the\r\nresponsibility of directing her.\" Harsanyi paused and crushed his soft\r\ngray hat over his knee. \"She would interest you, Mr. Thomas,\" he added\r\nslowly. \"She has a quality--very individual.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; the Scandinavians are apt to have that, too. She can't go to\r\nGermany, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not now, at any rate. She is poor.\"\r\n\r\nThomas frowned again \"I don't think Bowers a really first-rate man. He's\r\ntoo petty to be really first-rate; in his nature, I mean. But I dare say\r\nhe's the best you can do, if you can't give her time enough yourself.\"\r\n\r\nHarsanyi waved his hand. \"Oh, the time is nothing--she may have all she\r\nwants. But I cannot teach her to sing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Might not come amiss if you made a musician of her, however,\" said Mr.\r\nThomas dryly.\r\n\r\n\"I have done my best. But I can only play with a voice, and this is not\r\na voice to be played with. I think she will be a musician, whatever\r\nhappens. She is not quick, but she is solid, real; not like these\r\nothers. My wife says that with that girl one swallow does not make a\r\nsummer.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas laughed. \"Tell Mrs. Harsanyi that her remark conveys\r\nsomething to me. Don't let yourself get too much interested. Voices are\r\nso often disappointing; especially women's voices. So much chance about\r\nit, so many factors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps that is why they interest one. All the intelligence and talent\r\nin the world can't make a singer. The voice is a wild thing. It can't be\r\nbred in captivity. It is a sport, like the silver fox. It happens.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas smiled into Harsanyi's gleaming eye. \"Why haven't you brought\r\nher to sing for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been tempted to, but I knew you were driven to death, with this\r\ntour confronting you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I can always find time to listen to a girl who has a voice, if she\r\nmeans business. I'm sorry I'm leaving so soon. I could advise you better\r\nif I had heard her. I can sometimes give a singer suggestions. I've\r\nworked so much with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're the only conductor I know who is not snobbish about singers.\"\r\nHarsanyi spoke warmly.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me, why should I be? They've learned from me, and I've learned\r\nfrom them.\" As they rose, Thomas took the younger man affectionately by\r\nthe arm. \"Tell me about that wife of yours. Is she well, and as lovely\r\nas ever? And such fine children! Come to see me oftener, when I get\r\nback. I miss it when you don't.\"\r\n\r\nThe two men left the Auditorium Building together. Harsanyi walked home.\r\nEven a short talk with Thomas always stimulated him. As he walked he was\r\nrecalling an evening they once spent together in Cincinnati.\r\n\r\nHarsanyi was the soloist at one of Thomas's concerts there, and after\r\nthe performance the conductor had taken him off to a RATHSKELLER where\r\nthere was excellent German cooking, and where the proprietor saw to it\r\nthat Thomas had the best wines procurable. Thomas had been working with\r\nthe great chorus of the Festival Association and was speaking of it with\r\nenthusiasm when Harsanyi asked him how it was that he was able to feel\r\nsuch an interest in choral directing and in voices generally. Thomas\r\nseldom spoke of his youth or his early struggles, but that night he\r\nturned back the pages and told Harsanyi a long story.\r\n\r\nHe said he had spent the summer of his fifteenth year wandering about\r\nalone in the South, giving violin concerts in little towns. He traveled\r\non horseback. When he came into a town, he went about all day tacking up\r\nposters announcing his concert in the evening. Before the concert, he\r\nstood at the door taking in the admission money until his audience had\r\narrived, and then he went on the platform and played. It was a lazy,\r\nhand-to-mouth existence, and Thomas said he must have got to like that\r\neasy way of living and the relaxing Southern atmosphere. At any rate,\r\nwhen he got back to New York in the fall, he was rather torpid; perhaps\r\nhe had been growing too fast. From this adolescent drowsiness the lad\r\nwas awakened by two voices, by two women who sang in New York in\r\n1851,--Jenny Lind and Henrietta Sontag. They were the first great\r\nartists he had ever heard, and he never forgot his debt to them.\r\n\r\nAs he said, \"It was not voice and execution alone. There was a greatness\r\nabout them. They were great women, great artists. They opened a new\r\nworld to me.\" Night after night he went to hear them, striving to\r\nreproduce the quality of their tone upon his violin. From that time his\r\nidea about strings was completely changed, and on his violin he tried\r\nalways for the singing, vibrating tone, instead of the loud and somewhat\r\nharsh tone then prevalent among even the best German violinists. In\r\nlater years he often advised violinists to study singing, and singers to\r\nstudy violin. He told Harsanyi that he got his first conception of tone\r\nquality from Jenny Lind.\r\n\r\n\"But, of course,\" he added, \"the great thing I got from Lind and Sontag\r\nwas the indefinite, not the definite, thing. For an impressionable boy,\r\ntheir inspiration was incalculable. They gave me my first feeling for\r\nthe Italian style--but I could never say how much they gave me. At that\r\nage, such influences are actually creative. I always think of my\r\nartistic consciousness as beginning then.\"\r\n\r\nAll his life Thomas did his best to repay what he felt he owed to the\r\nsinger's art. No man could get such singing from choruses, and no man\r\nworked harder to raise the standard of singing in schools and churches\r\nand choral societies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nAll through the lesson Thea had felt that Harsanyi was restless and\r\nabstracted. Before the hour was over, he pushed back his chair and said\r\nresolutely, \"I am not in the mood, Miss Kronborg. I have something on my\r\nmind, and I must talk to you. When do you intend to go home?\"\r\n\r\nThea turned to him in surprise. \"The first of June, about. Mr. Larsen\r\nwill not need me after that, and I have not much money ahead. I shall\r\nwork hard this summer, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to-day is the first of May; May-day.\" Harsanyi leaned forward, his\r\nelbows on his knees, his hands locked between them. \"Yes, I must talk to\r\nyou about something. I have asked Madison Bowers to let me bring you to\r\nhim on Thursday, at your usual lesson-time. He is the best vocal teacher\r\nin Chicago, and it is time you began to work seriously with your voice.\"\r\n\r\nThea's brow wrinkled. \"You mean take lessons of Bowers?\"\r\n\r\nHarsanyi nodded, without lifting his head.\r\n\r\n\"But I can't, Mr. Harsanyi. I haven't got the time, and, besides--\" she\r\nblushed and drew her shoulders up stiffly--\"besides, I can't afford to\r\npay two teachers.\" Thea felt that she had blurted this out in the worst\r\npossible way, and she turned back to the keyboard to hide her chagrin.\r\n\r\n\"I know that. I don't mean that you shall pay two teachers. After you go\r\nto Bowers you will not need me. I need scarcely tell you that I shan't\r\nbe happy at losing you.\"\r\n\r\nThea turned to him, hurt and angry. \"But I don't want to go to Bowers. I\r\ndon't want to leave you. What's the matter? Don't I work hard enough?\r\nI'm sure you teach people that don't try half as hard.\"\r\n\r\nHarsanyi rose to his feet. \"Don't misunderstand me, Miss Kronborg. You\r\ninterest me more than any pupil I have. I have been thinking for months\r\nabout what you ought to do, since that night when you first sang for\r\nme.\" He walked over to the window, turned, and came toward her again. \"I\r\nbelieve that your voice is worth all that you can put into it. I have\r\nnot come to this decision rashly. I have studied you, and I have become\r\nmore and more convinced, against my own desires. I cannot make a singer\r\nof you, so it was my business to find a man who could. I have even\r\nconsulted Theodore Thomas about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose I don't want to be a singer? I want to study with you.\r\nWhat's the matter? Do you really think I've no talent? Can't I be a\r\npianist?\"\r\n\r\nHarsanyi paced up and down the long rug in front of her. \"My girl, you\r\nare very talented. You could be a pianist, a good one. But the early\r\ntraining of a pianist, such a pianist as you would want to be, must be\r\nsomething tremendous. He must have had no other life than music. At your\r\nage he must be the master of his instrument. Nothing can ever take the\r\nplace of that first training. You know very well that your technique is\r\ngood, but it is not remarkable. It will never overtake your\r\nintelligence. You have a fine power of work, but you are not by nature a\r\nstudent. You are not by nature, I think, a pianist. You would never find\r\nyourself. In the effort to do so, I'm afraid your playing would become\r\nwarped, eccentric.\" He threw back his head and looked at his pupil\r\nintently with that one eye which sometimes seemed to see deeper than any\r\ntwo eyes, as if its singleness gave it privileges. \"Oh, I have watched\r\nyou very carefully, Miss Kronborg. Because you had had so little and had\r\nyet done so much for yourself, I had a great wish to help you. I believe\r\nthat the strongest need of your nature is to find yourself, to emerge AS\r\nyourself. Until I heard you sing I wondered how you were to do this, but\r\nit has grown clearer to me every day.\"\r\n\r\nThea looked away toward the window with hard, narrow eyes. \"You mean I\r\ncan be a singer because I haven't brains enough to be a pianist.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have brains enough and talent enough. But to do what you will want\r\nto do, it takes more than these--it takes vocation. Now, I think you\r\nhave vocation, but for the voice, not for the piano. If you knew,\"--he\r\nstopped and sighed,--\"if you knew how fortunate I sometimes think you.\r\nWith the voice the way is so much shorter, the rewards are more easily\r\nwon. In your voice I think Nature herself did for you what it would take\r\nyou many years to do at the piano. Perhaps you were not born in the\r\nwrong place after all. Let us talk frankly now. We have never done so\r\nbefore, and I have respected your reticence. What you want more than\r\nanything else in the world is to be an artist; is that true?\"\r\n\r\nShe turned her face away from him and looked down at the keyboard. Her\r\nanswer came in a thickened voice. \"Yes, I suppose so.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did you first feel that you wanted to be an artist?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. There was always--something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you never think that you were going to sing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long ago was that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Always, until I came to you. It was you who made me want to play\r\npiano.\" Her voice trembled. \"Before, I tried to think I did, but I was\r\npretending.\"\r\n\r\nHarsanyi reached out and caught the hand that was hanging at her side.\r\nHe pressed it as if to give her something. \"Can't you see, my dear girl,\r\nthat was only because I happened to be the first artist you have ever\r\nknown? If I had been a trombone player, it would have been the same; you\r\nwould have wanted to play trombone. But all the while you have been\r\nworking with such good-will, something has been struggling against me.\r\nSee, here we were, you and I and this instrument,\"--he tapped the\r\npiano,--\"three good friends, working so hard. But all the while there\r\nwas something fighting us: your gift, and the woman you were meant to\r\nbe. When you find your way to that gift and to that woman, you will be\r\nat peace. In the beginning it was an artist that you wanted to be; well,\r\nyou may be an artist, always.\"\r\n\r\nThea drew a long breath. Her hands fell in her lap. \"So I'm just where I\r\nbegan. No teacher, nothing done. No money.\"\r\n\r\nHarsanyi turned away. \"Feel no apprehension about the money, Miss\r\nKronborg. Come back in the fall and we shall manage that. I shall even\r\ngo to Mr. Thomas if necessary. This year will not be lost. If you but\r\nknew what an advantage this winter's study, all your study of the piano,\r\nwill give you over most singers. Perhaps things have come out better for\r\nyou than if we had planned them knowingly.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean they have IF I can sing.\"\r\n\r\nThea spoke with a heavy irony, so heavy, indeed, that it was coarse. It\r\ngrated upon Harsanyi because he felt that it was not sincere, an awkward\r\naffectation.\r\n\r\nHe wheeled toward her. \"Miss Kronborg, answer me this. YOU KNOW THAT YOU\r\nCAN SING, do you not? You have always known it. While we worked here\r\ntogether you sometimes said to yourself, 'I have something you know\r\nnothing about; I could surprise you.' Is that also true?\"\r\n\r\nThea nodded and hung her head.\r\n\r\n\"Why were you not frank with me? Did I not deserve it?\"\r\n\r\nShe shuddered. Her bent shoulders trembled. \"I don't know,\" she\r\nmuttered. \"I didn't mean to be like that. I couldn't. I can't. It's\r\ndifferent.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean it is very personal?\" he asked kindly.\r\n\r\nShe nodded. \"Not at church or funerals, or with people like Mr. Larsen.\r\nBut with you it was--personal. I'm not like you and Mrs. Harsanyi. I\r\ncome of rough people. I'm rough. But I'm independent, too. It was--all I\r\nhad. There is no use my talking, Mr. Harsanyi. I can't tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't tell me. I know. Every artist knows.\" Harsanyi stood\r\nlooking at his pupil's back, bent as if she were pushing something, at\r\nher lowered head. \"You can sing for those people because with them you\r\ndo not commit yourself. But the reality, one cannot uncover THAT until\r\none is sure. One can fail one's self, but one must not live to see that\r\nfail; better never reveal it. Let me help you to make yourself sure of\r\nit. That I can do better than Bowers.\"\r\n\r\nThea lifted her face and threw out her hands.\r\n\r\nHarsanyi shook his head and smiled. \"Oh, promise nothing! You will have\r\nmuch to do. There will not be voice only, but French, German, Italian.\r\nYou will have work enough. But sometimes you will need to be understood;\r\nwhat you never show to any one will need companionship. And then you\r\nmust come to me.\" He peered into her face with that searching, intimate\r\nglance. \"You know what I mean, the thing in you that has no business\r\nwith what is little, that will have to do only with beauty and power.\"\r\n\r\nThea threw out her hands fiercely, as if to push him away. She made a\r\nsound in her throat, but it was not articulate. Harsanyi took one of her\r\nhands and kissed it lightly upon the back. His salute was one of\r\ngreeting, not of farewell, and it was for some one he had never seen.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Harsanyi came in at six o'clock, she found her husband sitting\r\nlistlessly by the window. \"Tired?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"A little. I've just got through a difficulty. I've sent Miss Kronborg\r\naway; turned her over to Bowers, for voice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sent Miss Kronborg away? Andor, what is the matter with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's nothing rash. I've known for a long while I ought to do it. She is\r\nmade for a singer, not a pianist.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Harsanyi sat down on the piano chair. She spoke a little bitterly:\r\n\"How can you be sure of that? She was, at least, the best you had. I\r\nthought you meant to have her play at your students' recital next fall.\r\nI am sure she would have made an impression. I could have dressed her so\r\nthat she would have been very striking. She had so much individuality.\"\r\n\r\nHarsanyi bent forward, looking at the floor. \"Yes, I know. I shall miss\r\nher, of course.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Harsanyi looked at her husband's fine head against the gray window.\r\nShe had never felt deeper tenderness for him than she did at that\r\nmoment. Her heart ached for him. \"You will never get on, Andor,\" she\r\nsaid mournfully.\r\n\r\nHarsanyi sat motionless. \"No, I shall never get on,\" he repeated\r\nquietly. Suddenly he sprang up with that light movement she knew so\r\nwell, and stood in the window, with folded arms. \"But some day I shall\r\nbe able to look her in the face and laugh because I did what I could for\r\nher. I believe in her. She will do nothing common. She is uncommon, in a\r\ncommon, common world. That is what I get out of it. It means more to me\r\nthan if she played at my concert and brought me a dozen pupils. All this\r\ndrudgery will kill me if once in a while I cannot hope something, for\r\nsomebody! If I cannot sometimes see a bird fly and wave my hand to it.\"\r\n\r\nHis tone was angry and injured. Mrs. Harsanyi understood that this was\r\none of the times when his wife was a part of the drudgery, of the\r\n\"common, common world.\"\r\n\r\nHe had let something he cared for go, and he felt bitterly about\r\nwhatever was left. The mood would pass, and he would be sorry. She knew\r\nhim. It wounded her, of course, but that hurt was not new. It was as old\r\nas her love for him. She went out and left him alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nONE warm damp June night the Denver Express was speeding westward across\r\nthe earthy-smelling plains of Iowa. The lights in the day-coach were\r\nturned low and the ventilators were open, admitting showers of soot and\r\ndust upon the occupants of the narrow green plush chairs which were\r\ntilted at various angles of discomfort. In each of these chairs some\r\nuncomfortable human being lay drawn up, or stretched out, or writhing\r\nfrom one position to another. There were tired men in rumpled shirts,\r\ntheir necks bare and their suspenders down; old women with their heads\r\ntied up in black handkerchiefs; bedraggled young women who went to sleep\r\nwhile they were nursing their babies and forgot to button up their\r\ndresses; dirty boys who added to the general discomfort by taking off\r\ntheir boots. The brakeman, when he came through at midnight, sniffed the\r\nheavy air disdainfully and looked up at the ventilators. As he glanced\r\ndown the double rows of contorted figures, he saw one pair of eyes that\r\nwere wide open and bright, a yellow head that was not overcome by the\r\nstupefying heat and smell in the car. \"There's a girl for you,\" he\r\nthought as he stopped by Thea's chair.\r\n\r\n\"Like to have the window up a little?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nThea smiled up at him, not misunderstanding his friendliness. \"The girl\r\nbehind me is sick; she can't stand a draft. What time is it, please?\"\r\n\r\nHe took out his open-faced watch and held it before her eyes with a\r\nknowing look. \"In a hurry?\" he asked. \"I'll leave the end door open and\r\nair you out. Catch a wink; the time'll go faster.\"\r\n\r\nThea nodded good-night to him and settled her head back on her pillow,\r\nlooking up at the oil lamps. She was going back to Moonstone for her\r\nsummer vacation, and she was sitting up all night in a day-coach because\r\nthat seemed such an easy way to save money. At her age discomfort was a\r\nsmall matter, when one made five dollars a day by it. She had\r\nconfidently expected to sleep after the car got quiet, but in the two\r\nchairs behind her were a sick girl and her mother, and the girl had been\r\ncoughing steadily since ten o'clock. They had come from somewhere in\r\nPennsylvania, and this was their second night on the road. The mother\r\nsaid they were going to Colorado \"for her daughter's lungs.\" The\r\ndaughter was a little older than Thea, perhaps nineteen, with patient\r\ndark eyes and curly brown hair. She was pretty in spite of being so\r\nsooty and travel-stained. She had put on an ugly figured satine kimono\r\nover her loosened clothes. Thea, when she boarded the train in Chicago,\r\nhappened to stop and plant her heavy telescope on this seat. She had not\r\nintended to remain there, but the sick girl had looked up at her with an\r\neager smile and said, \"Do sit there, miss. I'd so much rather not have a\r\ngentleman in front of me.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the girl began to cough there were no empty seats left, and if\r\nthere had been Thea could scarcely have changed without hurting her\r\nfeelings. The mother turned on her side and went to sleep; she was used\r\nto the cough. But the girl lay wide awake, her eyes fixed on the roof of\r\nthe car, as Thea's were. The two girls must have seen very different\r\nthings there.\r\n\r\nThea fell to going over her winter in Chicago. It was only under unusual\r\nor uncomfortable conditions like these that she could keep her mind\r\nfixed upon herself or her own affairs for any length of time. The rapid\r\nmotion and the vibration of the wheels under her seemed to give her\r\nthoughts rapidity and clearness. She had taken twenty very expensive\r\nlessons from Madison Bowers, but she did not yet know what he thought of\r\nher or of her ability. He was different from any man with whom she had\r\never had to do. With her other teachers she had felt a personal\r\nrelation; but with him she did not. Bowers was a cold, bitter,\r\navaricious man, but he knew a great deal about voices. He worked with a\r\nvoice as if he were in a laboratory, conducting a series of experiments.\r\nHe was conscientious and industrious, even capable of a certain cold\r\nfury when he was working with an interesting voice, but Harsanyi\r\ndeclared that he had the soul of a shrimp, and could no more make an\r\nartist than a throat specialist could. Thea realized that he had taught\r\nher a great deal in twenty lessons.\r\n\r\nAlthough she cared so much less for Bowers than for Harsanyi, Thea was,\r\non the whole, happier since she had been studying with him than she had\r\nbeen before. She had always told herself that she studied piano to fit\r\nherself to be a music teacher. But she never asked herself why she was\r\nstudying voice. Her voice, more than any other part of her, had to do\r\nwith that confidence, that sense of wholeness and inner well-being that\r\nshe had felt at moments ever since she could remember.\r\n\r\nOf this feeling Thea had never spoken to any human being until that day\r\nwhen she told Harsanyi that \"there had always been--something.\" Hitherto\r\nshe had felt but one obligation toward it--secrecy; to protect it even\r\nfrom herself. She had always believed that by doing all that was\r\nrequired of her by her family, her teachers, her pupils, she kept that\r\npart of herself from being caught up in the meshes of common things. She\r\ntook it for granted that some day, when she was older, she would know a\r\ngreat deal more about it. It was as if she had an appointment to meet\r\nthe rest of herself sometime, somewhere. It was moving to meet her and\r\nshe was moving to meet it. That meeting awaited her, just as surely as,\r\nfor the poor girl in the seat behind her, there awaited a hole in the\r\nearth, already dug.\r\n\r\nFor Thea, so much had begun with a hole in the earth. Yes, she\r\nreflected, this new part of her life had all begun that morning when she\r\nsat on the clay bank beside Ray Kennedy, under the flickering shade of\r\nthe cottonwood tree. She remembered the way Ray had looked at her that\r\nmorning. Why had he cared so much? And Wunsch, and Dr. Archie, and\r\nSpanish Johnny, why had they? It was something that had to do with her\r\nthat made them care, but it was not she. It was something they believed\r\nin, but it was not she. Perhaps each of them concealed another person in\r\nhimself, just as she did. Why was it that they seemed to feel and to\r\nhunt for a second person in her and not in each other? Thea frowned up\r\nat the dull lamp in the roof of the car. What if one's second self could\r\nsomehow speak to all these second selves? What if one could bring them\r\nout, as whiskey did Spanish Johnny's? How deep they lay, these second\r\npersons, and how little one knew about them, except to guard them\r\nfiercely. It was to music, more than to anything else, that these hidden\r\nthings in people responded. Her mother--even her mother had something of\r\nthat sort which replied to music.\r\n\r\nThea found herself listening for the coughing behind her and not hearing\r\nit. She turned cautiously and looked back over the head-rest of her\r\nchair. The poor girl had fallen asleep. Thea looked at her intently. Why\r\nwas she so afraid of men? Why did she shrink into herself and avert her\r\nface whenever a man passed her chair? Thea thought she knew; of course,\r\nshe knew. How horrible to waste away like that, in the time when one\r\nought to be growing fuller and stronger and rounder every day. Suppose\r\nthere were such a dark hole open for her, between to-night and that\r\nplace where she was to meet herself? Her eyes narrowed. She put her hand\r\non her breast and felt how warm it was; and within it there was a full,\r\npowerful pulsation. She smiled--though she was ashamed of it--with the\r\nnatural contempt of strength for weakness, with the sense of physical\r\nsecurity which makes the savage merciless. Nobody could die while they\r\nfelt like that inside. The springs there were wound so tight that it\r\nwould be a long while before there was any slack in them. The life in\r\nthere was rooted deep. She was going to have a few things before she\r\ndied. She realized that there were a great many trains dashing east and\r\nwest on the face of the continent that night, and that they all carried\r\nyoung people who meant to have things. But the difference was that SHE\r\nWAS GOING TO GET THEM! That was all. Let people try to stop her! She\r\nglowered at the rows of feckless bodies that lay sprawled in the chairs.\r\nLet them try it once! Along with the yearning that came from some deep\r\npart of her, that was selfless and exalted, Thea had a hard kind of\r\ncockiness, a determination to get ahead. Well, there are passages in\r\nlife when that fierce, stubborn self-assertion will stand its ground\r\nafter the nobler feeling is overwhelmed and beaten under.\r\n\r\nHaving told herself once more that she meant to grab a few things, Thea\r\nwent to sleep.\r\n\r\nShe was wakened in the morning by the sunlight, which beat fiercely\r\nthrough the glass of the car window upon her face. She made herself as\r\nclean as she could, and while the people all about her were getting cold\r\nfood out of their lunch-baskets she escaped into the dining-car. Her\r\nthrift did not go to the point of enabling her to carry a lunchbasket.\r\nAt that early hour there were few people in the dining-car. The linen\r\nwas white and fresh, the darkies were trim and smiling, and the sunlight\r\ngleamed pleasantly upon the silver and the glass water-bottles. On each\r\ntable there was a slender vase with a single pink rose in it. When Thea\r\nsat down she looked into her rose and thought it the most beautiful\r\nthing in the world; it was wide open, recklessly offering its yellow\r\nheart, and there were drops of water on the petals. All the future was\r\nin that rose, all that one would like to be. The flower put her in an\r\nabsolutely regal mood. She had a whole pot of coffee, and scrambled eggs\r\nwith chopped ham, utterly disregarding the astonishing price they cost.\r\nShe had faith enough in what she could do, she told herself, to have\r\neggs if she wanted them. At the table opposite her sat a man and his\r\nwife and little boy--Thea classified them as being \"from the East.\"\r\nThey spoke in that quick, sure staccato, which Thea, like Ray Kennedy,\r\npretended to scorn and secretly admired. People who could use words in\r\nthat confident way, and who spoke them elegantly, had a great advantage\r\nin life, she reflected. There were so many words which she could not\r\npronounce in speech as she had to do in singing. Language was like\r\nclothes; it could be a help to one, or it could give one away. But the\r\nmost important thing was that one should not pretend to be what one was\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nWhen she paid her check she consulted the waiter. \"Waiter, do you\r\nsuppose I could buy one of those roses? I'm out of the day-coach, and\r\nthere is a sick girl in there. I'd like to take her a cup of coffee and\r\none of those flowers.\"\r\n\r\nThe waiter liked nothing better than advising travelers less\r\nsophisticated than himself. He told Thea there were a few roses left in\r\nthe icebox and he would get one. He took the flower and the coffee into\r\nthe day-coach. Thea pointed out the girl, but she did not accompany him.\r\nShe hated thanks and never received them gracefully. She stood outside\r\non the platform to get some fresh air into her lungs. The train was\r\ncrossing the Platte River now, and the sunlight was so intense that it\r\nseemed to quiver in little flames on the glittering sandbars, the scrub\r\nwillows, and the curling, fretted shallows.\r\n\r\nThea felt that she was coming back to her own land. She had often heard\r\nMrs. Kronborg say that she \"believed in immigration,\" and so did Thea\r\nbelieve in it. This earth seemed to her young and fresh and kindly, a\r\nplace where refugees from old, sad countries were given another chance.\r\nThe mere absence of rocks gave the soil a kind of amiability and\r\ngenerosity, and the absence of natural boundaries gave the spirit a\r\nwider range. Wire fences might mark the end of a man's pasture, but they\r\ncould not shut in his thoughts as mountains and forests can. It was over\r\nflat lands like this, stretching out to drink the sun, that the larks\r\nsang--and one's heart sang there, too. Thea was glad that this was her\r\ncountry, even if one did not learn to speak elegantly there. It was,\r\nsomehow, an honest country, and there was a new song in that blue air\r\nwhich had never been sung in the world before. It was hard to tell about\r\nit, for it had nothing to do with words; it was like the light of the\r\ndesert at noon, or the smell of the sagebrush after rain; intangible but\r\npowerful. She had the sense of going back to a friendly soil, whose\r\nfriendship was somehow going to strengthen her; a naive, generous\r\ncountry that gave one its joyous force, its large-hearted, childlike\r\npower to love, just as it gave one its coarse, brilliant flowers.\r\n\r\nAs she drew in that glorious air Thea's mind went back to Ray Kennedy.\r\nHe, too, had that feeling of empire; as if all the Southwest really\r\nbelonged to him because he had knocked about over it so much, and knew\r\nit, as he said, \"like the blisters on his own hands.\" That feeling, she\r\nreflected, was the real element of companionship between her and Ray.\r\nNow that she was going back to Colorado, she realized this as she had\r\nnot done before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHEA reached Moonstone in the late afternoon, and all the Kronborgs were\r\nthere to meet her except her two older brothers. Gus and Charley were\r\nyoung men now, and they had declared at noon that it would \"look silly\r\nif the whole bunch went down to the train.\" \"There's no use making a\r\nfuss over Thea just because she's been to Chicago,\" Charley warned his\r\nmother. \"She's inclined to think pretty well of herself, anyhow, and if\r\nyou go treating her like company, there'll be no living in the house\r\nwith her.\" Mrs. Kronborg simply leveled her eyes at Charley, and he\r\nfaded away, muttering. She had, as Mr. Kronborg always said with an\r\ninclination of his head, good control over her children. Anna, too,\r\nwished to absent herself from the party, but in the end her curiosity\r\ngot the better of her. So when Thea stepped down from the porter's\r\nstool, a very creditable Kronborg representation was grouped on the\r\nplatform to greet her. After they had all kissed her (Gunner and Axel\r\nshyly), Mr. Kronborg hurried his flock into the hotel omnibus, in which\r\nthey were to be driven ceremoniously home, with the neighbors looking\r\nout of their windows to see them go by.\r\n\r\nAll the family talked to her at once, except Thor,--impressive in new\r\ntrousers,--who was gravely silent and who refused to sit on Thea's lap.\r\nOne of the first things Anna told her was that Maggie Evans, the girl\r\nwho used to cough in prayer meeting, died yesterday, and had made a\r\nrequest that Thea sing at her funeral.\r\n\r\nThea's smile froze. \"I'm not going to sing at all this summer, except my\r\nexercises. Bowers says I taxed my voice last winter, singing at funerals\r\nso much. If I begin the first day after I get home, there'll be no end\r\nto it. You can tell them I caught cold on the train, or something.\"\r\n\r\nThea saw Anna glance at their mother. Thea remembered having seen that\r\nlook on Anna's face often before, but she had never thought anything\r\nabout it because she was used to it. Now she realized that the look was\r\ndistinctly spiteful, even vindictive. She suddenly realized that Anna\r\nhad always disliked her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kronborg seemed to notice nothing, and changed the trend of the\r\nconversation, telling Thea that Dr. Archie and Mr. Upping, the jeweler,\r\nwere both coming in to see her that evening, and that she had asked\r\nSpanish Johnny to come, because he had behaved well all winter and ought\r\nto be encouraged.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Thea wakened early in her own room up under the eaves\r\nand lay watching the sunlight shine on the roses of her wall-paper. She\r\nwondered whether she would ever like a plastered room as well as this\r\none lined with scantlings. It was snug and tight, like the cabin of a\r\nlittle boat. Her bed faced the window and stood against the wall, under\r\nthe slant of the ceiling. When she went away she could just touch the\r\nceiling with the tips of her fingers; now she could touch it with the\r\npalm of her hand. It was so little that it was like a sunny cave, with\r\nroses running all over the roof. Through the low window, as she lay\r\nthere, she could watch people going by on the farther side of the\r\nstreet; men, going downtown to open their stores. Thor was over there,\r\nrattling his express wagon along the sidewalk. Tillie had put a bunch of\r\nFrench pinks in a tumbler of water on her dresser, and they gave out a\r\npleasant perfume. The blue jays were fighting and screeching in the\r\ncottonwood tree outside her window, as they always did, and she could\r\nhear the old Baptist deacon across the street calling his chickens, as\r\nshe had heard him do every summer morning since she could remember. It\r\nwas pleasant to waken up in that bed, in that room, and to feel the\r\nbrightness of the morning, while light quivered about the low, papered\r\nceiling in golden spots, refracted by the broken mirror and the glass of\r\nwater that held the pinks. \"IM LEUCHTENDEN SOMMERMORGEN\"; those lines,\r\nand the face of her old teacher, came back to Thea, floated to her out\r\nof sleep, perhaps. She had been dreaming something pleasant, but she\r\ncould not remember what. She would go to call upon Mrs. Kohler to-day,\r\nand see the pigeons washing their pink feet in the drip under the water\r\ntank, and flying about their house that was sure to have a fresh coat of\r\nwhite paint on it for summer. On the way home she would stop to see Mrs.\r\nTellamantez. On Sunday she would coax Gunner to take her out to the sand\r\nhills. She had missed them in Chicago; had been homesick for their\r\nbrilliant morning gold and for their soft colors at evening. The Lake,\r\nsomehow, had never taken their place.\r\n\r\nWhile she lay planning, relaxed in warm drowsiness, she heard a knock at\r\nher door. She supposed it was Tillie, who sometimes fluttered in on her\r\nbefore she was out of bed to offer some service which the family would\r\nhave ridiculed. But instead, Mrs. Kronborg herself came in, carrying a\r\ntray with Thea's breakfast set out on one of the best white napkins.\r\nThea sat up with some embarrassment and pulled her nightgown together\r\nacross her chest. Mrs. Kronborg was always busy downstairs in the\r\nmorning, and Thea could not remember when her mother had come to her\r\nroom before.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you'd be tired, after traveling, and might like to take it\r\neasy for once.\" Mrs. Kronborg put the tray on the edge of the bed. \"I\r\ntook some thick cream for you before the boys got at it. They raised a\r\nhowl.\" She chuckled and sat down in the big wooden rocking chair. Her\r\nvisit made Thea feel grown-up, and, somehow, important.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kronborg asked her about Bowers and the Harsanyis. She felt a great\r\nchange in Thea, in her face and in her manner. Mr. Kronborg had noticed\r\nit, too, and had spoken of it to his wife with great satisfaction while\r\nthey were undressing last night. Mrs. Kronborg sat looking at her\r\ndaughter, who lay on her side, supporting herself on her elbow and\r\nlazily drinking her coffee from the tray before her. Her short-sleeved\r\nnightgown had come open at the throat again, and Mrs. Kronborg noticed\r\nhow white her arms and shoulders were, as if they had been dipped in new\r\nmilk. Her chest was fuller than when she went away, her breasts rounder\r\nand firmer, and though she was so white where she was uncovered, they\r\nlooked rosy through the thin muslin. Her body had the elasticity that\r\ncomes of being highly charged with the desire to live. Her hair, hanging\r\nin two loose braids, one by either cheek, was just enough disordered to\r\ncatch the light in all its curly ends.\r\n\r\nThea always woke with a pink flush on her cheeks, and this morning her\r\nmother thought she had never seen her eyes so wide-open and bright; like\r\nclear green springs in the wood, when the early sunlight sparkles in\r\nthem. She would make a very handsome woman, Mrs. Kronborg said to\r\nherself, if she would only get rid of that fierce look she had\r\nsometimes. Mrs. Kronborg took great pleasure in good looks, wherever she\r\nfound them. She still remembered that, as a baby, Thea had been the\r\n\"best-formed\" of any of her children.\r\n\r\n\"I'll have to get you a longer bed,\" she remarked, as she put the tray\r\non the table. \"You're getting too long for that one.\"\r\n\r\nThea looked up at her mother and laughed, dropping back on her pillow\r\nwith a magnificent stretch of her whole body. Mrs. Kronborg sat down\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like to press you, Thea, but I think you'd better sing at that\r\nfuneral to-morrow. I'm afraid you'll always be sorry if you don't.\r\nSometimes a little thing like that, that seems nothing at the time,\r\ncomes back on one afterward and troubles one a good deal. I don't mean\r\nthe church shall run you to death this summer, like they used to. I've\r\nspoken my mind to your father about that, and he's very reasonable. But\r\nMaggie talked a good deal about you to people this winter; always asked\r\nwhat word we'd had, and said how she missed your singing and all. I\r\nguess you ought to do that much for her.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, mother, if you think so.\" Thea lay looking at her mother\r\nwith intensely bright eyes.\r\n\r\n\"That's right, daughter.\" Mrs. Kronborg rose and went over to get the\r\ntray, stopping to put her hand on Thea's chest. \"You're filling out\r\nnice,\" she said, feeling about. \"No, I wouldn't bother about the\r\nbuttons. Leave 'em stay off. This is a good time to harden your chest.\"\r\n\r\nThea lay still and heard her mother's firm step receding along the bare\r\nfloor of the trunk loft. There was no sham about her mother, she\r\nreflected. Her mother knew a great many things of which she never\r\ntalked, and all the church people were forever chattering about things\r\nof which they knew nothing. She liked her mother.\r\n\r\nNow for Mexican Town and the Kohlers! She meant to run in on the old\r\nwoman without warning, and hug her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nSPANISH JOHNNY had no shop of his own, but he kept a table and an\r\norder-book in one corner of the drug store where paints and wall-paper\r\nwere sold, and he was sometimes to be found there for an hour or so\r\nabout noon. Thea had gone into the drug store to have a friendly chat\r\nwith the proprietor, who used to lend her books from his shelves. She\r\nfound Johnny there, trimming rolls of wall-paper for the parlor of\r\nBanker Smith's new house. She sat down on the top of his table and\r\nwatched him.\r\n\r\n\"Johnny,\" she said suddenly, \"I want you to write down the words of that\r\nMexican serenade you used to sing; you know, 'ROSA DE NOCHE.' It's an\r\nunusual song. I'm going to study it. I know enough Spanish for that.\"\r\n\r\nJohnny looked up from his roller with his bright, affable smile. \"SI,\r\nbut it is low for you, I think; VOZ CONTRALTO. It is low for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense. I can do more with my low voice than I used to. I'll show\r\nyou. Sit down and write it out for me, please.\" Thea beckoned him with\r\nthe short yellow pencil tied to his order-book.\r\n\r\nJohnny ran his fingers through his curly black hair. \"If you wish. I do\r\nnot know if that SERENATA all right for young ladies. Down there it is\r\nmore for married ladies. They sing it for husbands--or somebody else,\r\nmay-bee.\" Johnny's eyes twinkled and he apologized gracefully with his\r\nshoulders. He sat down at the table, and while Thea looked over his arm,\r\nbegan to write the song down in a long, slanting script, with highly\r\nornamental capitals. Presently he looked up. \"This-a song not exactly\r\nMexican,\" he said thoughtfully. \"It come from farther down; Brazil,\r\nVenezuela, may-bee. I learn it from some fellow down there, and he learn\r\nit from another fellow. It is-a most like Mexican, but not quite.\" Thea\r\ndid not release him, but pointed to the paper. There were three verses\r\nof the song in all, and when Johnny had written them down, he sat\r\nlooking at them meditatively, his head on one side. \"I don' think for a\r\nhigh voice, SENORITA,\" he objected with polite persistence. \"How you\r\naccompany with piano?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that will be easy enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"For you, may-bee!\" Johnny smiled and drummed on the table with the tips\r\nof his agile brown fingers. \"You know something? Listen, I tell you.\" He\r\nrose and sat down on the table beside her, putting his foot on the\r\nchair. He loved to talk at the hour of noon. \"When you was a little\r\ngirl, no bigger than that, you come to my house one day 'bout noon, like\r\nthis, and I was in the door, playing guitar. You was barehead, barefoot;\r\nyou run away from home. You stand there and make a frown at me an'\r\nlisten. By 'n by you say for me to sing. I sing some lil' ting, and then\r\nI say for you to sing with me. You don' know no words, of course, but\r\nyou take the air and you sing it justa beauti-ful! I never see a child\r\ndo that, outside Mexico. You was, oh, I do' know--seven year, may-bee.\r\nBy 'n by the preacher come look for you and begin for scold. I say,\r\n'Don' scold, Meester Kronborg. She come for hear guitar. She gotta some\r\nmusic in her, that child. Where she get?' Then he tell me 'bout your\r\ngran'papa play oboe in the old country. I never forgetta that time.\"\r\nJohnny chuckled softly.\r\n\r\nThea nodded. \"I remember that day, too. I liked your music better than\r\nthe church music. When are you going to have a dance over there,\r\nJohnny?\"\r\n\r\nJohnny tilted his head. \"Well, Saturday night the Spanish boys have a\r\nlil' party, some DANZA. You know Miguel Ramas? He have some young\r\ncousins, two boys, very nice-a, come from Torreon. They going to Salt\r\nLake for some job-a, and stay off with him two-three days, and he mus'\r\nhave a party. You like to come?\"\r\n\r\nThat was how Thea came to go to the Mexican ball. Mexican Town had been\r\nincreased by half a dozen new families during the last few years, and\r\nthe Mexicans had put up an adobe dance-hall, that looked exactly like\r\none of their own dwellings, except that it was a little longer, and was\r\nso unpretentious that nobody in Moonstone knew of its existence. The\r\n\"Spanish boys\" are reticent about their own affairs. Ray Kennedy used to\r\nknow about all their little doings, but since his death there was no one\r\nwhom the Mexicans considered SIMPATICO.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday evening after supper Thea told her mother that she was going\r\nover to Mrs. Tellamantez's to watch the Mexicans dance for a while, and\r\nthat Johnny would bring her home.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kronborg smiled. She noticed that Thea had put on a white dress and\r\nhad done her hair up with unusual care, and that she carried her best\r\nblue scarf. \"Maybe you'll take a turn yourself, eh? I wouldn't mind\r\nwatching them Mexicans. They're lovely dancers.\"\r\n\r\nThea made a feeble suggestion that her mother might go with her, but\r\nMrs. Kronborg was too wise for that. She knew that Thea would have a\r\nbetter time if she went alone, and she watched her daughter go out of\r\nthe gate and down the sidewalk that led to the depot.\r\n\r\nThea walked slowly. It was a soft, rosy evening. The sand hills were\r\nlavender. The sun had gone down a glowing copper disk, and the fleecy\r\nclouds in the east were a burning rose-color, flecked with gold. Thea\r\npassed the cottonwood grove and then the depot, where she left the\r\nsidewalk and took the sandy path toward Mexican Town. She could hear the\r\nscraping of violins being tuned, the tinkle of mandolins, and the growl\r\nof a double bass. Where had they got a double bass? She did not know\r\nthere was one in Moonstone. She found later that it was the property\r\nof one of Ramas's young cousins, who was taking it to Utah with him\r\nto cheer him at his \"job-a.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mexicans never wait until it is dark to begin to dance, and Thea had\r\nno difficulty in finding the new hall, because every other house in the\r\ntown was deserted. Even the babies had gone to the ball; a neighbor was\r\nalways willing to hold the baby while the mother danced. Mrs.\r\nTellamantez came out to meet Thea and led her in. Johnny bowed to her\r\nfrom the platform at the end of the room, where he was playing the\r\nmandolin along with two fiddles and the bass. The hall was a long low\r\nroom, with whitewashed walls, a fairly tight plank floor, wooden benches\r\nalong the sides, and a few bracket lamps screwed to the frame timbers.\r\nThere must have been fifty people there, counting the children. The\r\nMexican dances were very much family affairs. The fathers always danced\r\nagain and again with their little daughters, as well as with their\r\nwives. One of the girls came up to greet Thea, her dark cheeks glowing\r\nwith pleasure and cordiality, and introduced her brother, with whom she\r\nhad just been dancing. \"You better take him every time he asks you,\" she\r\nwhispered. \"He's the best dancer here, except Johnny.\"\r\n\r\nThea soon decided that the poorest dancer was herself. Even Mrs.\r\nTellamantez, who always held her shoulders so stiffly, danced better\r\nthan she did. The musicians did not remain long at their post. When one\r\nof them felt like dancing, he called some other boy to take his\r\ninstrument, put on his coat, and went down on the floor. Johnny, who\r\nwore a blousy white silk shirt, did not even put on his coat.\r\n\r\nThe dances the railroad men gave in Firemen's Hall were the only dances\r\nThea had ever been allowed to go to, and they were very different from\r\nthis. The boys played rough jokes and thought it smart to be clumsy and\r\nto run into each other on the floor. For the square dances there was\r\nalways the bawling voice of the caller, who was also the county\r\nauctioneer.\r\n\r\nThis Mexican dance was soft and quiet. There was no calling, the\r\nconversation was very low, the rhythm of the music was smooth and\r\nengaging, the men were graceful and courteous. Some of them Thea had\r\nnever before seen out of their working clothes, smeared with grease from\r\nthe round-house or clay from the brickyard. Sometimes, when the music\r\nhappened to be a popular Mexican waltz song, the dancers sang it softly\r\nas they moved. There were three little girls under twelve, in their\r\nfirst communion dresses, and one of them had an orange marigold in her\r\nblack hair, just over her ear. They danced with the men and with each\r\nother. There was an atmosphere of ease and friendly pleasure in the low,\r\ndimly lit room, and Thea could not help wondering whether the Mexicans\r\nhad no jealousies or neighborly grudges as the people in Moonstone had.\r\nThere was no constraint of any kind there to-night, but a kind of\r\nnatural harmony about their movements, their greetings, their low\r\nconversation, their smiles.\r\n\r\nRamas brought up his two young cousins, Silvo and Felipe, and presented\r\nthem. They were handsome, smiling youths, of eighteen and twenty, with\r\npale-gold skins, smooth cheeks, aquiline features, and wavy black hair,\r\nlike Johnny's. They were dressed alike, in black velvet jackets and soft\r\nsilk shirts, with opal shirt-buttons and flowing black ties looped\r\nthrough gold rings. They had charming manners, and low, guitar-like\r\nvoices. They knew almost no English, but a Mexican boy can pay a great\r\nmany compliments with a very limited vocabulary. The Ramas boys thought\r\nThea dazzlingly beautiful. They had never seen a Scandinavian girl\r\nbefore, and her hair and fair skin bewitched them. \"BLANCO Y ORO,\r\nSEMEJANTE LA PASCUA!\" (White and gold, like Easter!) they exclaimed to\r\neach other. Silvo, the younger, declared that he could never go on to\r\nUtah; that he and his double bass had reached their ultimate\r\ndestination. The elder was more crafty; he asked Miguel Ramas whether\r\nthere would be \"plenty more girls like that _A_ Salt Lake, maybee?\"\r\n\r\nSilvo, overhearing, gave his brother a contemptuous glance. \"Plenty more\r\nA PARAISO may-bee!\" he retorted. When they were not dancing with her,\r\ntheir eyes followed her, over the coiffures of their other partners.\r\nThat was not difficult; one blonde head moving among so many dark ones.\r\n\r\nThea had not meant to dance much, but the Ramas boys danced so well and\r\nwere so handsome and adoring that she yielded to their entreaties. When\r\nshe sat out a dance with them, they talked to her about their family at\r\nhome, and told her how their mother had once punned upon their name.\r\nRAMA, in Spanish, meant a branch, they explained. Once when they were\r\nlittle lads their mother took them along when she went to help the women\r\ndecorate the church for Easter. Some one asked her whether she had\r\nbrought any flowers, and she replied that she had brought her \"ramas.\"\r\nThis was evidently a cherished family story.\r\n\r\nWhen it was nearly midnight, Johnny announced that every one was going\r\nto his house to have \"some lil' icecream and some lil' MUSICA.\" He began\r\nto put out the lights and Mrs. Tellamantez led the way across the square\r\nto her CASA. The Ramas brothers escorted Thea, and as they stepped out\r\nof the door, Silvo exclaimed, \"HACE FRIO!\" and threw his velvet coat\r\nabout her shoulders.\r\n\r\nMost of the company followed Mrs. Tellamantez, and they sat about on the\r\ngravel in her little yard while she and Johnny and Mrs. Miguel Ramas\r\nserved the ice-cream. Thea sat on Felipe's coat, since Silvo's was\r\nalready about her shoulders. The youths lay down on the shining gravel\r\nbeside her, one on her right and one on her left. Johnny already called\r\nthem \"LOS ACOLITOS,\" the altar-boys. The talk all about them was low,\r\nand indolent. One of the girls was playing on Johnny's guitar, another\r\nwas picking lightly at a mandolin. The moonlight was so bright that one\r\ncould see every glance and smile, and the flash of their teeth. The\r\nmoonflowers over Mrs. Tellamantez's door were wide open and of an\r\nunearthly white. The moon itself looked like a great pale flower in the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nAfter all the ice-cream was gone, Johnny approached Thea, his guitar\r\nunder his arm, and the elder Ramas boy politely gave up his place.\r\nJohnny sat down, took a long breath, struck a fierce chord, and then\r\nhushed it with his other hand. \"Now we have some lil' SERENATA, eh? You\r\nwan' a try?\"\r\n\r\nWhen Thea began to sing, instant silence fell upon the company. She felt\r\nall those dark eyes fix themselves upon her intently. She could see them\r\nshine. The faces came out of the shadow like the white flowers over the\r\ndoor. Felipe leaned his head upon his hand. Silvo dropped on his back\r\nand lay looking at the moon, under the impression that he was still\r\nlooking at Thea. When she finished the first verse, Thea whispered to\r\nJohnny, \"Again, I can do it better than that.\"\r\n\r\nShe had sung for churches and funerals and teachers, but she had never\r\nbefore sung for a really musical people, and this was the first time she\r\nhad ever felt the response that such a people can give. They turned\r\nthemselves and all they had over to her. For the moment they cared about\r\nnothing in the world but what she was doing. Their faces confronted her,\r\nopen, eager, unprotected. She felt as if all these warm-blooded people\r\ndebouched into her. Mrs. Tellamantez's fateful resignation, Johnny's\r\nmadness, the adoration of the boy who lay still in the sand; in an\r\ninstant these things seemed to be within her instead of without, as if\r\nthey had come from her in the first place.\r\n\r\nWhen she finished, her listeners broke into excited murmur. The men\r\nbegan hunting feverishly for cigarettes. Famos Serranos the barytone\r\nbricklayer, touched Johnny's arm, gave him a questioning look, then\r\nheaved a deep sigh. Johnny dropped on his elbow, wiping his face and\r\nneck and hands with his handkerchief. \"SENORITA,\" he panted, \"if you\r\nsing like that once in the City of Mexico, they just-a go crazy. In the\r\nCity of Mexico they ain't-a sit like stumps when they hear that, not-a\r\nmuch! When they like, they just-a give you the town.\"\r\n\r\nThea laughed. She, too, was excited. \"Think so, Johnny? Come, sing\r\nsomething with me. EL PARRENO; I haven't sung that for a long time.\"\r\n\r\nJohnny laughed and hugged his guitar. \"You not-a forget him?\" He began\r\nteasing his strings. \"Come!\" He threw back his head, \"ANOCHE-E-E--\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"ANOCHE ME CONFESSE CON UN PADRE CARMELITE, Y ME DIO PENITENCIA QUE\r\nBESARAS TU BOQUITA.\"\r\n\r\n(Last night I made confession With a Carmelite father, And he gave me\r\nabsolution For the kisses you imprinted.)\r\n\r\n\r\nJohnny had almost every fault that a tenor can have. His voice was thin,\r\nunsteady, husky in the middle tones. But it was distinctly a voice, and\r\nsometimes he managed to get something very sweet out of it. Certainly it\r\nmade him happy to sing. Thea kept glancing down at him as he lay there\r\non his elbow. His eyes seemed twice as large as usual and had lights in\r\nthem like those the moonlight makes on black, running water. Thea\r\nremembered the old stories about his \"spells.\" She had never seen him\r\nwhen his madness was on him, but she felt something tonight at her elbow\r\nthat gave her an idea of what it might be like. For the first time she\r\nfully understood the cryptic explanation that Mrs. Tellamantez had made\r\nto Dr. Archie, long ago. There were the same shells along the walk; she\r\nbelieved she could pick out the very one. There was the same moon up\r\nyonder, and panting at her elbow was the same Johnny--fooled by the same\r\nold things!\r\n\r\nWhen they had finished, Famos, the barytone, murmured something to\r\nJohnny; who replied, \"Sure we can sing 'Trovatore.' We have no alto, but\r\nall the girls can sing alto and make some noise.\"\r\n\r\nThe women laughed. Mexican women of the poorer class do not sing like\r\nthe men. Perhaps they are too indolent. In the evening, when the men are\r\nsinging their throats dry on the doorstep, or around the camp-fire\r\nbeside the work-train, the women usually sit and comb their hair.\r\n\r\nWhile Johnny was gesticulating and telling everybody what to sing and\r\nhow to sing it, Thea put out her foot and touched the corpse of Silvo\r\nwith the toe of her slipper. \"Aren't you going to sing, Silvo?\" she\r\nasked teasingly.\r\n\r\nThe boy turned on his side and raised himself on his elbow for a moment.\r\n\"Not this night, SENORITA,\" he pleaded softly, \"not this night!\" He\r\ndropped back again, and lay with his cheek on his right arm, the hand\r\nlying passive on the sand above his head.\r\n\r\n\"How does he flatten himself into the ground like that?\" Thea asked\r\nherself. \"I wish I knew. It's very effective, somehow.\"\r\n\r\nAcross the gulch the Kohlers' little house slept among its trees, a dark\r\nspot on the white face of the desert. The windows of their upstairs\r\nbedroom were open, and Paulina had listened to the dance music for a\r\nlong while before she drowsed off. She was a light sleeper, and when she\r\nwoke again, after midnight, Johnny's concert was at its height. She lay\r\nstill until she could bear it no longer. Then she wakened Fritz and they\r\nwent over to the window and leaned out. They could hear clearly there.\r\n\r\n\"DIE THEA,\" whispered Mrs. Kohler; \"it must be. ACH, WUNDERSCHON!\"\r\n\r\nFritz was not so wide awake as his wife. He grunted and scratched on the\r\nfloor with his bare foot. They were listening to a Mexican part-song;\r\nthe tenor, then the soprano, then both together; the barytone joins\r\nthem, rages, is extinguished; the tenor expires in sobs, and the soprano\r\nfinishes alone. When the soprano's last note died away, Fritz nodded to\r\nhis wife. \"JA,\" he said; \"SCHON.\"\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a few moments. Then the guitar sounded fiercely,\r\nand several male voices began the sextette from \"Lucia.\" Johnny's reedy\r\ntenor they knew well, and the bricklayer's big, opaque barytone; the\r\nothers might be anybody over there--just Mexican voices. Then at the\r\nappointed, at the acute, moment, the soprano voice, like a fountain jet,\r\nshot up into the light. \"HORCH! HORCH!\" the old people whispered, both\r\nat once. How it leaped from among those dusky male voices! How it played\r\nin and about and around and over them, like a goldfish darting among\r\ncreek minnows, like a yellow butterfly soaring above a swarm of dark\r\nones. \"Ah,\" said Mrs. Kohler softly, \"the dear man; if he could hear her\r\nnow!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nMRS. KRONBORG had said that Thea was not to be disturbed on Sunday\r\nmorning, and she slept until noon. When she came downstairs the family\r\nwere just sitting down to dinner, Mr. Kronborg at one end of the long\r\ntable, Mrs. Kronborg at the other. Anna, stiff and ceremonious, in her\r\nsummer silk, sat at her father's right, and the boys were strung along\r\non either side of the table. There was a place left for Thea between her\r\nmother and Thor. During the silence which preceded the blessing, Thea\r\nfelt something uncomfortable in the air. Anna and her older brothers had\r\nlowered their eyes when she came in. Mrs. Kronborg nodded cheerfully,\r\nand after the blessing, as she began to pour the coffee, turned to her.\r\n\r\n\"I expect you had a good time at that dance, Thea. I hope you got your\r\nsleep out.\"\r\n\r\n\"High society, that,\" remarked Charley, giving the mashed potatoes a\r\nvicious swat. Anna's mouth and eyebrows became half-moons.\r\n\r\nThea looked across the table at the uncompromising countenances of her\r\nolder brothers. \"Why, what's the matter with the Mexicans?\" she asked,\r\nflushing. \"They don't trouble anybody, and they are kind to their\r\nfamilies and have good manners.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nice clean people; got some style about them. Do you really like that\r\nkind, Thea, or do you just pretend to? That's what I'd like to know.\"\r\nGus looked at her with pained inquiry. But he at least looked at her.\r\n\r\n\"They're just as clean as white people, and they have a perfect right to\r\ntheir own ways. Of course I like 'em. I don't pretend things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everybody according to their own taste,\" remarked Charley bitterly.\r\n\"Quit crumbing your bread up, Thor. Ain't you learned how to eat yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Children, children!\" said Mr. Kronborg nervously, looking up from the\r\nchicken he was dismembering. He glanced at his wife, whom he expected to\r\nmaintain harmony in the family.\r\n\r\n\"That's all right, Charley. Drop it there,\" said Mrs. Kronborg. \"No use\r\nspoiling your Sunday dinner with race prejudices. The Mexicans suit me\r\nand Thea very well. They are a useful people. Now you can just talk\r\nabout something else.\"\r\n\r\nConversation, however, did not flourish at that dinner. Everybody ate as\r\nfast as possible. Charley and Gus said they had engagements and left the\r\ntable as soon as they finished their apple pie. Anna sat primly and ate\r\nwith great elegance. When she spoke at all she spoke to her father,\r\nabout church matters, and always in a commiserating tone, as if he had\r\nmet with some misfortune. Mr. Kronborg, quite innocent of her\r\nintentions, replied kindly and absent-mindedly. After the dessert he\r\nwent to take his usual Sunday afternoon nap, and Mrs. Kronborg carried\r\nsome dinner to a sick neighbor. Thea and Anna began to clear the table.\r\n\r\n\"I should think you would show more consideration for father's position,\r\nThea,\" Anna began as soon as she and her sister were alone.\r\n\r\nThea gave her a sidelong glance. \"Why, what have I done to father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everybody at Sunday-School was talking about you going over there and\r\nsinging with the Mexicans all night, when you won't sing for the church.\r\nSomebody heard you, and told it all over town. Of course, we all get the\r\nblame for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything disgraceful about singing?\" Thea asked with a provoking yawn.\r\n\r\n\"I must say you choose your company! You always had that streak in you,\r\nThea. We all hoped that going away would improve you. Of course, it\r\nreflects on father when you are scarcely polite to the nice people here\r\nand make up to the rowdies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's my singing with the Mexicans you object to?\" Thea put down a\r\ntray full of dishes. \"Well, I like to sing over there, and I don't like\r\nto over here. I'll sing for them any time they ask me to. They know\r\nsomething about what I'm doing. They're a talented people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Talented!\" Anna made the word sound like escaping steam. \"I suppose you\r\nthink it's smart to come home and throw that at your family!\"\r\n\r\nThea picked up the tray. By this time she was as white as the Sunday\r\ntablecloth. \"Well,\" she replied in a cold, even tone, \"I'll have to\r\nthrow it at them sooner or later. It's just a question of when, and it\r\nmight as well be now as any time.\" She carried the tray blindly into the\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\nTillie, who was always listening and looking out for her, took the\r\ndishes from her with a furtive, frightened glance at her stony face.\r\nThea went slowly up the back stairs to her loft. Her legs seemed as\r\nheavy as lead as she climbed the stairs, and she felt as if everything\r\ninside her had solidified and grown hard.\r\n\r\nAfter shutting her door and locking it, she sat down on the edge of her\r\nbed. This place had always been her refuge, but there was a hostility in\r\nthe house now which this door could not shut out. This would be her last\r\nsummer in that room. Its services were over; its time was done. She rose\r\nand put her hand on the low ceiling. Two tears ran down her cheeks, as\r\nif they came from ice that melted slowly. She was not ready to leave her\r\nlittle shell. She was being pulled out too soon. She would never be able\r\nto think anywhere else as well as here. She would never sleep so well or\r\nhave such dreams in any other bed; even last night, such sweet,\r\nbreathless dreams--Thea hid her face in the pillow. Wherever she went\r\nshe would like to take that little bed with her. When she went away from\r\nit for good, she would leave something that she could never recover;\r\nmemories of pleasant excitement, of happy adventures in her mind; of\r\nwarm sleep on howling winter nights, and joyous awakenings on summer\r\nmornings. There were certain dreams that might refuse to come to her at\r\nall except in a little morning cave, facing the sun--where they came to\r\nher so powerfully, where they beat a triumph in her!\r\n\r\nThe room was hot as an oven. The sun was beating fiercely on the\r\nshingles behind the board ceiling. She undressed, and before she threw\r\nherself upon her bed in her chemise, she frowned at herself for a long\r\nwhile in her looking-glass. Yes, she and It must fight it out together.\r\nThe thing that looked at her out of her own eyes was the only friend she\r\ncould count on. Oh, she would make these people sorry enough! There\r\nwould come a time when they would want to make it up with her. But,\r\nnever again! She had no little vanities, only one big one, and she would\r\nnever forgive.\r\n\r\nHer mother was all right, but her mother was a part of the family, and\r\nshe was not. In the nature of things, her mother had to be on both\r\nsides. Thea felt that she had been betrayed. A truce had been broken\r\nbehind her back. She had never had much individual affection for any of\r\nher brothers except Thor, but she had never been disloyal, never felt\r\nscorn or held grudges. As a little girl she had always been good friends\r\nwith Gunner and Axel, whenever she had time to play. Even before she got\r\nher own room, when they were all sleeping and dressing together, like\r\nlittle cubs, and breakfasting in the kitchen, she had led an absorbing\r\npersonal life of her own. But she had a cub loyalty to the other cubs.\r\nShe thought them nice boys and tried to make them get their lessons. She\r\nonce fought a bully who \"picked on\" Axel at school. She never made fun\r\nof Anna's crimpings and curlings and beauty-rites.\r\n\r\nThea had always taken it for granted that her sister and brothers\r\nrecognized that she had special abilities, and that they were proud of\r\nit. She had done them the honor, she told herself bitterly, to believe\r\nthat though they had no particular endowments, THEY WERE OF HER KIND,\r\nand not of the Moonstone kind. Now they had all grown up and become\r\npersons. They faced each other as individuals, and she saw that Anna and\r\nGus and Charley were among the people whom she had always recognized as\r\nher natural enemies. Their ambitions and sacred proprieties were\r\nmeaningless to her. She had neglected to congratulate Charley upon\r\nhaving been promoted from the grocery department of Commings's store to\r\nthe drygoods department. Her mother had reproved her for this omission.\r\nAnd how was she to know, Thea asked herself, that Anna expected to be\r\nteased because Bert Rice now came and sat in the hammock with her every\r\nnight? No, it was all clear enough. Nothing that she would ever do in\r\nthe world would seem important to them, and nothing they would ever do\r\nwould seem important to her.\r\n\r\nThea lay thinking intently all through the stifling afternoon. Tillie\r\nwhispered something outside her door once, but she did not answer. She\r\nlay on her bed until the second church bell rang, and she saw the family\r\ngo trooping up the sidewalk on the opposite side of the street, Anna and\r\nher father in the lead. Anna seemed to have taken on a very story-book\r\nattitude toward her father; patronizing and condescending, it seemed to\r\nThea. The older boys were not in the family band. They now took their\r\ngirls to church. Tillie had stayed at home to get supper. Thea got up,\r\nwashed her hot face and arms, and put on the white organdie dress she\r\nhad worn last night; it was getting too small for her, and she might as\r\nwell wear it out. After she was dressed she unlocked her door and went\r\ncautiously downstairs. She felt as if chilling hostilities might be\r\nawaiting her in the trunk loft, on the stairway, almost anywhere. In the\r\ndining-room she found Tillie, sitting by the open window, reading the\r\ndramatic news in a Denver Sunday paper. Tillie kept a scrapbook in which\r\nshe pasted clippings about actors and actresses.\r\n\r\n\"Come look at this picture of Pauline Hall in tights, Thea,\" she called.\r\n\"Ain't she cute? It's too bad you didn't go to the theater more when you\r\nwas in Chicago; such a good chance! Didn't you even get to see Clara\r\nMorris or Modjeska?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I didn't have time. Besides, it costs money, Tillie,\" Thea replied\r\nwearily, glancing at the paper Tillie held out to her.\r\n\r\nTillie looked up at her niece. \"Don't you go and be upset about any of\r\nAnna's notions. She's one of these narrow kind. Your father and mother\r\ndon't pay any attention to what she says. Anna's fussy; she is with me,\r\nbut I don't mind her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't mind her. That's all right, Tillie. I guess I'll take a\r\nwalk.\"\r\n\r\nThea knew that Tillie hoped she would stay and talk to her for a while,\r\nand she would have liked to please her. But in a house as small as that\r\none, everything was too intimate and mixed up together. The family was\r\nthe family, an integral thing. One couldn't discuss Anna there. She felt\r\ndifferently toward the house and everything in it, as if the battered\r\nold furniture that seemed so kindly, and the old carpets on which she\r\nhad played, had been nourishing a secret grudge against her and were not\r\nto be trusted any more.\r\n\r\nShe went aimlessly out of the front gate, not knowing what to do with\r\nherself. Mexican Town, somehow, was spoiled for her just then, and she\r\nfelt that she would hide if she saw Silvo or Felipe coming toward her.\r\nShe walked down through the empty main street. All the stores were\r\nclosed, their blinds down. On the steps of the bank some idle boys were\r\nsitting, telling disgusting stories because there was nothing else to\r\ndo. Several of them had gone to school with Thea, but when she nodded to\r\nthem they hung their heads and did not speak. Thea's body was often\r\ncuriously expressive of what was going on in her mind, and to-night\r\nthere was something in her walk and carriage that made these boys feel\r\nthat she was \"stuck up.\" If she had stopped and talked to them, they\r\nwould have thawed out on the instant and would have been friendly and\r\ngrateful. But Thea was hurt afresh, and walked on, holding her chin\r\nhigher than ever. As she passed the Duke Block, she saw a light in Dr.\r\nArchie's office, and she went up the stairs and opened the door into his\r\nstudy. She found him with a pile of papers and accountbooks before him.\r\nHe pointed her to her old chair at the end of his desk and leaned back\r\nin his own, looking at her with satisfaction. How handsome she was\r\ngrowing!\r\n\r\n\"I'm still chasing the elusive metal, Thea,\"--he pointed to the papers\r\nbefore him,--\"I'm up to my neck in mines, and I'm going to be a rich man\r\nsome day.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will; awfully rich. That's the only thing that counts.\" She\r\nlooked restlessly about the consulting-room. \"To do any of the things one\r\nwants to do, one has to have lots and lots of money.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie was direct. \"What's the matter? Do you need some?\"\r\n\r\nThea shrugged. \"Oh, I can get along, in a little way.\" She looked\r\nintently out of the window at the arc streetlamp that was just beginning\r\nto sputter. \"But it's silly to live at all for little things,\" she added\r\nquietly. \"Living's too much trouble unless one can get something big out\r\nof it.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie rested his elbows on the arms of his chair, dropped his chin\r\non his clasped hands and looked at her. \"Living is no trouble for little\r\npeople, believe me!\" he exclaimed. \"What do you want to get out of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh--so many things!\" Thea shivered.\r\n\r\n\"But what? Money? You mentioned that. Well, you can make money, if you\r\ncare about that more than anything else.\" He nodded prophetically above\r\nhis interlacing fingers.\r\n\r\n\"But I don't. That's only one thing. Anyhow, I couldn't if I did.\" She\r\npulled her dress lower at the neck as if she were suffocating. \"I only\r\nwant impossible things,\" she said roughly. \"The others don't interest\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie watched her contemplatively, as if she were a beaker full of\r\nchemicals working. A few years ago, when she used to sit there, the\r\nlight from under his green lampshade used to fall full upon her broad\r\nface and yellow pigtails. Now her face was in the shadow and the line of\r\nlight fell below her bare throat, directly across her bosom. The\r\nshrunken white organdie rose and fell as if she were struggling to be\r\nfree and to break out of it altogether. He felt that her heart must be\r\nlaboring heavily in there, but he was afraid to touch her; he was,\r\nindeed. He had never seen her like this before. Her hair, piled high on\r\nher head, gave her a commanding look, and her eyes, that used to be so\r\ninquisitive, were stormy.\r\n\r\n\"Thea,\" he said slowly, \"I won't say that you can have everything you\r\nwant--that means having nothing, in reality. But if you decide what it\r\nis you want most, YOU CAN GET IT.\" His eye caught hers for a moment.\r\n\"Not everybody can, but you can. Only, if you want a big thing, you've\r\ngot to have nerve enough to cut out all that's easy, everything that's\r\nto be had cheap.\" Dr. Archie paused. He picked up a paper-cutter and,\r\nfeeling the edge of it softly with his fingers, he added slowly, as if\r\nto himself:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He either fears his fate too much, Or his deserts are small, Who dares\r\nnot put it to the touch To win...or lose it all.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThea's lips parted; she looked at him from under a frown, searching his\r\nface. \"Do you mean to break loose, too, and--do something?\" she asked\r\nin a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"I mean to get rich, if you call that doing anything. I've found what I\r\ncan do without. You make such bargains in your mind, first.\"\r\n\r\nThea sprang up and took the paper-cutter he had put down, twisting it in\r\nher hands. \"A long while first, sometimes,\" she said with a short laugh.\r\n\"But suppose one can never get out what they've got in them? Suppose\r\nthey make a mess of it in the end; then what?\" She threw the\r\npaper-cutter on the desk and took a step toward the doctor, until her\r\ndress touched him. She stood looking down at him. \"Oh, it's easy to\r\nfail!\" She was breathing through her mouth and her throat was throbbing\r\nwith excitement.\r\n\r\nAs he looked up at her, Dr. Archie's hands tightened on the arms of his\r\nchair. He had thought he knew Thea Kronborg pretty well, but he did not\r\nknow the girl who was standing there. She was beautiful, as his little\r\nSwede had never been, but she frightened him. Her pale cheeks, her\r\nparted lips, her flashing eyes, seemed suddenly to mean one thing--he\r\ndid not know what. A light seemed to break upon her from far away--or\r\nperhaps from far within. She seemed to grow taller, like a scarf drawn\r\nout long; looked as if she were pursued and fleeing, and--yes, she\r\nlooked tormented. \"It's easy to fail,\" he heard her say again, \"and if I\r\nfail, you'd better forget about me, for I'll be one of the worst women\r\nthat ever lived. I'll be an awful woman!\"\r\n\r\nIn the shadowy light above the lampshade he caught her glance again and\r\nheld it for a moment. Wild as her eyes were, that yellow gleam at the\r\nback of them was as hard as a diamond drill-point. He rose with a\r\nnervous laugh and dropped his hand lightly on her shoulder. \"No, you\r\nwon't. You'll be a splendid one!\"\r\n\r\nShe shook him off before he could say anything more, and went out of his\r\ndoor with a kind of bound. She left so quickly and so lightly that he\r\ncould not even hear her footstep in the hallway outside. Archie dropped\r\nback into his chair and sat motionless for a long while.\r\n\r\nSo it went; one loved a quaint little girl, cheerful, industrious,\r\nalways on the run and hustling through her tasks; and suddenly one lost\r\nher. He had thought he knew that child like the glove on his hand. But\r\nabout this tall girl who threw up her head and glittered like that all\r\nover, he knew nothing. She was goaded by desires, ambitions, revulsions\r\nthat were dark to him. One thing he knew: the old highroad of life, worn\r\nsafe and easy, hugging the sunny slopes, would scarcely hold her again.\r\n\r\nAfter that night Thea could have asked pretty much anything of him. He\r\ncould have refused her nothing. Years ago a crafty little bunch of hair\r\nand smiles had shown him what she wanted, and he had promptly married\r\nher. To-night a very different sort of girl--driven wild by doubts and\r\nyouth, by poverty and riches--had let him see the fierceness of her\r\nnature. She went out still distraught, not knowing or caring what she\r\nhad shown him. But to Archie knowledge of that sort was obligation. Oh,\r\nhe was the same old Howard Archie!\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Sunday in July was the turning-point; Thea's peace of mind did not\r\ncome back. She found it hard even to practice at home. There was\r\nsomething in the air there that froze her throat. In the morning, she\r\nwalked as far as she could walk. In the hot afternoons she lay on her\r\nbed in her nightgown, planning fiercely. She haunted the post-office.\r\nShe must have worn a path in the sidewalk that led to the post-office,\r\nthat summer. She was there the moment the mail-sacks came up from the\r\ndepot, morning and evening, and while the letters were being sorted and\r\ndistributed she paced up and down outside, under the cottonwood trees,\r\nlistening to the thump, thump, thump of Mr. Thompson's stamp. She hung\r\nupon any sort of word from Chicago; a card from Bowers, a letter from\r\nMrs. Harsanyi, from Mr. Larsen, from her landlady,--anything to reassure\r\nher that Chicago was still there. She began to feel the same\r\nrestlessness that had tortured her the last spring when she was teaching\r\nin Moonstone. Suppose she never got away again, after all? Suppose one\r\nbroke a leg and had to lie in bed at home for weeks, or had pneumonia\r\nand died there. The desert was so big and thirsty; if one's foot\r\nslipped, it could drink one up like a drop of water.\r\n\r\nThis time, when Thea left Moonstone to go back to Chicago, she went\r\nalone. As the train pulled out, she looked back at her mother and father\r\nand Thor. They were calm and cheerful; they did not know, they did not\r\nunderstand. Something pulled in her--and broke. She cried all the way to\r\nDenver, and that night, in her berth, she kept sobbing and waking\r\nherself. But when the sun rose in the morning, she was far away. It was\r\nall behind her, and she knew that she would never cry like that again.\r\nPeople live through such pain only once; pain comes again, but it finds\r\na tougher surface. Thea remembered how she had gone away the first time,\r\nwith what confidence in everything, and what pitiful ignorance. Such a\r\nsilly! She felt resentful toward that stupid, good-natured child. How\r\nmuch older she was now, and how much harder! She was going away to\r\nfight, and she was going away forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III. STUPID FACES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nSo many grinning, stupid faces! Thea was sitting by the window in\r\nBowers's studio, waiting for him to come back from lunch. On her knee\r\nwas the latest number of an illustrated musical journal in which\r\nmusicians great and little stridently advertised their wares. Every\r\nafternoon she played accompaniments for people who looked and smiled\r\nlike these. She was getting tired of the human countenance.\r\n\r\nThea had been in Chicago for two months. She had a small church position\r\nwhich partly paid her living expenses, and she paid for her singing\r\nlessons by playing Bowers's accompaniments every afternoon from two\r\nuntil six. She had been compelled to leave her old friends Mrs. Lorch\r\nand Mrs. Andersen, because the long ride from North Chicago to Bowers's\r\nstudio on Michigan Avenue took too much time--an hour in the morning,\r\nand at night, when the cars were crowded, an hour and a half. For the\r\nfirst month she had clung to her old room, but the bad air in the cars,\r\nat the end of a long day's work, fatigued her greatly and was bad for\r\nher voice. Since she left Mrs. Lorch, she had been staying at a\r\nstudents' club to which she was introduced by Miss Adler, Bowers's\r\nmorning accompanist, an intelligent Jewish girl from Evanston.\r\n\r\nThea took her lesson from Bowers every day from eleven-thirty until\r\ntwelve. Then she went out to lunch with an Italian grammar under her\r\narm, and came back to the studio to begin her work at two. In the\r\nafternoon Bowers coached professionals and taught his advanced pupils.\r\nIt was his theory that Thea ought to be able to learn a great deal by\r\nkeeping her ears open while she played for him.\r\n\r\nThe concert-going public of Chicago still remembers the long, sallow,\r\ndiscontented face of Madison Bowers. He seldom missed an evening\r\nconcert, and was usually to be seen lounging somewhere at the back of\r\nthe concert hall, reading a newspaper or review, and conspicuously\r\nignoring the efforts of the performers. At the end of a number he looked\r\nup from his paper long enough to sweep the applauding audience with a\r\ncontemptuous eye. His face was intelligent, with a narrow lower jaw, a\r\nthin nose, faded gray eyes, and a close-cut brown mustache. His hair was\r\niron-gray, thin and dead-looking. He went to concerts chiefly to satisfy\r\nhimself as to how badly things were done and how gullible the public\r\nwas. He hated the whole race of artists; the work they did, the wages\r\nthey got, and the way they spent their money. His father, old Hiram\r\nBowers, was still alive and at work, a genial old choirmaster in Boston,\r\nfull of enthusiasm at seventy. But Madison was of the colder stuff of\r\nhis grandfathers, a long line of New Hampshire farmers; hard workers,\r\nclose traders, with good minds, mean natures, and flinty eyes. As a boy\r\nMadison had a fine barytone voice, and his father made great sacrifices\r\nfor him, sending him to Germany at an early age and keeping him abroad\r\nat his studies for years. Madison worked under the best teachers, and\r\nafterward sang in England in oratorio. His cold nature and academic\r\nmethods were against him. His audiences were always aware of the\r\ncontempt he felt for them. A dozen poorer singers succeeded, but Bowers\r\ndid not.\r\n\r\nBowers had all the qualities which go to make a good teacher--except\r\ngenerosity and warmth. His intelligence was of a high order, his taste\r\nnever at fault. He seldom worked with a voice without improving it, and\r\nin teaching the delivery of oratorio he was without a rival. Singers came\r\nfrom far and near to study Bach and Handel with him. Even the fashionable\r\nsopranos and contraltos of Chicago, St. Paul, and St. Louis (they were\r\nusually ladies with very rich husbands, and Bowers called them the\r\n\"pampered jades of Asia\") humbly endured his sardonic humor for the sake\r\nof what he could do for them. He was not at all above helping a very\r\nlame singer across, if her husband's check-book warranted it. He had a\r\nwhole bag of tricks for stupid people, \"life-preservers,\" he called\r\nthem. \"Cheap repairs for a cheap 'un,\" he used to say, but the husbands\r\nnever found the repairs very cheap. Those were the days when lumbermen's\r\ndaughters and brewers' wives contended in song; studied in Germany and\r\nthen floated from SANGERFEST to SANGERFEST. Choral societies flourished\r\nin all the rich lake cities and river cities. The soloists came to\r\nChicago to coach with Bowers, and he often took long journeys to hear\r\nand instruct a chorus. He was intensely avaricious, and from these\r\nsemi-professionals he reaped a golden harvest. They fed his pockets and\r\nthey fed his ever-hungry contempt, his scorn of himself and his\r\naccomplices. The more money he made, the more parsimonious he became.\r\nHis wife was so shabby that she never went anywhere with him, which\r\nsuited him exactly. Because his clients were luxurious and extravagant,\r\nhe took a revengeful pleasure in having his shoes halfsoled a second\r\ntime, and in getting the last wear out of a broken collar. He had first\r\nbeen interested in Thea Kronborg because of her bluntness, her country\r\nroughness, and her manifest carefulness about money. The mention of\r\nHarsanyi's name always made him pull a wry face. For the first time Thea\r\nhad a friend who, in his own cool and guarded way, liked her for\r\nwhatever was least admirable in her.\r\n\r\nThea was still looking at the musical paper, her grammar unopened on the\r\nwindow-sill, when Bowers sauntered in a little before two o'clock. He\r\nwas smoking a cheap cigarette and wore the same soft felt hat he had\r\nworn all last winter. He never carried a cane or wore gloves.\r\n\r\nThea followed him from the reception-room into the studio. \"I may cut my\r\nlesson out to-morrow, Mr. Bowers. I have to hunt a new boarding-place.\"\r\n\r\nBowers looked up languidly from his desk where he had begun to go over a\r\npile of letters. \"What's the matter with the Studio Club? Been fighting\r\nwith them again?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Club's all right for people who like to live that way. I don't.\"\r\n\r\nBowers lifted his eyebrows. \"Why so tempery?\" he asked as he drew a\r\ncheck from an envelope postmarked \"Minneapolis.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't work with a lot of girls around. They're too familiar. I never\r\ncould get along with girls of my own age. It's all too chummy. Gets on\r\nmy nerves. I didn't come here to play kindergarten games.\" Thea began\r\nenergetically to arrange the scattered music on the piano.\r\n\r\nBowers grimaced good-humoredly at her over the three checks he was\r\npinning together. He liked to play at a rough game of banter with her.\r\nHe flattered himself that he had made her harsher than she was when she\r\nfirst came to him; that he had got off a little of the sugar-coating\r\nHarsanyi always put on his pupils.\r\n\r\n\"The art of making yourself agreeable never comes amiss, Miss Kronborg.\r\nI should say you rather need a little practice along that line. When you\r\ncome to marketing your wares in the world, a little smoothness goes\r\nfarther than a great deal of talent sometimes. If you happen to be\r\ncursed with a real talent, then you've got to be very smooth indeed, or\r\nyou'll never get your money back.\" Bowers snapped the elastic band\r\naround his bank-book.\r\n\r\nThea gave him a sharp, recognizing glance. \"Well, that's the money I'll\r\nhave to go without,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"Just what do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean the money people have to grin for. I used to know a railroad man\r\nwho said there was money in every profession that you couldn't take.\r\nHe'd tried a good many jobs,\" Thea added musingly; \"perhaps he was too\r\nparticular about the kind he could take, for he never picked up much. He\r\nwas proud, but I liked him for that.\"\r\n\r\nBowers rose and closed his desk. \"Mrs. Priest is late again. By the way,\r\nMiss Kronborg, remember not to frown when you are playing for Mrs.\r\nPriest. You did not remember yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean when she hits a tone with her breath like that? Why do you let\r\nher? You wouldn't let me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly would not. But that is a mannerism of Mrs. Priest's. The\r\npublic like it, and they pay a great deal of money for the pleasure of\r\nhearing her do it. There she is. Remember!\"\r\n\r\nBowers opened the door of the reception-room and a tall, imposing woman\r\nrustled in, bringing with her a glow of animation which pervaded the\r\nroom as if half a dozen persons, all talking gayly, had come in instead\r\nof one. She was large, handsome, expansive, uncontrolled; one felt this\r\nthe moment she crossed the threshold. She shone with care and\r\ncleanliness, mature vigor, unchallenged authority, gracious good-humor,\r\nand absolute confidence in her person, her powers, her position, and her\r\nway of life; a glowing, overwhelming self-satisfaction, only to be found\r\nwhere human society is young and strong and without yesterdays. Her face\r\nhad a kind of heavy, thoughtless beauty, like a pink peony just at the\r\npoint of beginning to fade. Her brown hair was waved in front and done\r\nup behind in a great twist, held by a tortoiseshell comb with gold\r\nfiligree. She wore a beautiful little green hat with three long green\r\nfeathers sticking straight up in front, a little cape made of velvet and\r\nfur with a yellow satin rose on it. Her gloves, her shoes, her veil,\r\nsomehow made themselves felt. She gave the impression of wearing a cargo\r\nof splendid merchandise.\r\n\r\nMrs. Priest nodded graciously to Thea, coquettishly to Bowers, and asked\r\nhim to untie her veil for her. She threw her splendid wrap on a chair,\r\nthe yellow lining out. Thea was already at the piano. Mrs. Priest stood\r\nbehind her.\r\n\r\n\"'Rejoice Greatly' first, please. And please don't hurry it in there,\"\r\nshe put her arm over Thea's shoulder, and indicated the passage by a\r\nsweep of her white glove. She threw out her chest, clasped her hands\r\nover her abdomen, lifted her chin, worked the muscles of her cheeks back\r\nand forth for a moment, and then began with conviction, \"Re-jo-oice!\r\nRe-jo-oice!\"\r\n\r\nBowers paced the room with his catlike tread. When he checked Mrs.\r\nPriest's vehemence at all, he handled her roughly; poked and hammered\r\nher massive person with cold satisfaction, almost as if he were taking\r\nout a grudge on this splendid creation. Such treatment the imposing lady\r\ndid not at all resent. She tried harder and harder, her eyes growing all\r\nthe while more lustrous and her lips redder. Thea played on as she was\r\ntold, ignoring the singer's struggles.\r\n\r\nWhen she first heard Mrs. Priest sing in church, Thea admired her. Since\r\nshe had found out how dull the goodnatured soprano really was, she felt\r\na deep contempt for her. She felt that Mrs. Priest ought to be reproved\r\nand even punished for her shortcomings; that she ought to be\r\nexposed,--at least to herself,--and not be permitted to live and shine\r\nin happy ignorance of what a poor thing it was she brought across so\r\nradiantly. Thea's cold looks of reproof were lost upon Mrs. Priest;\r\nalthough the lady did murmur one day when she took Bowers home in her\r\ncarriage, \"How handsome your afternoon girl would be if she did not have\r\nthat unfortunate squint; it gives her that vacant Swede look, like an\r\nanimal.\" That amused Bowers. He liked to watch the germination and\r\ngrowth of antipathies.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the first disappointments Thea had to face when she returned to\r\nChicago that fall, was the news that the Harsanyis were not coming back.\r\nThey had spent the summer in a camp in the Adirondacks and were moving\r\nto New York. An old teacher and friend of Harsanyi's, one of the\r\nbest-known piano teachers in New York, was about to retire because of\r\nfailing health and had arranged to turn his pupils over to Harsanyi.\r\nAndor was to give two recitals in New York in November, to devote\r\nhimself to his new students until spring, and then to go on a short\r\nconcert tour. The Harsanyis had taken a furnished apartment in New York,\r\nas they would not attempt to settle a place of their own until Andor's\r\nrecitals were over. The first of December, however, Thea received a note\r\nfrom Mrs. Harsanyi, asking her to call at the old studio, where she was\r\npacking their goods for shipment.\r\n\r\nThe morning after this invitation reached her, Thea climbed the stairs\r\nand knocked at the familiar door. Mrs. Harsanyi herself opened it, and\r\nembraced her visitor warmly. Taking Thea into the studio, which was\r\nlittered with excelsior and packing-cases, she stood holding her hand\r\nand looking at her in the strong light from the big window before she\r\nallowed her to sit down. Her quick eye saw many changes. The girl was\r\ntaller, her figure had become definite, her carriage positive. She had\r\ngot used to living in the body of a young woman, and she no longer tried\r\nto ignore it and behave as if she were a little girl. With that\r\nincreased independence of body there had come a change in her face; an\r\nindifference, something hard and skeptical. Her clothes, too, were\r\ndifferent, like the attire of a shopgirl who tries to follow the\r\nfashions; a purple suit, a piece of cheap fur, a three-cornered purple\r\nhat with a pompon sticking up in front. The queer country clothes she\r\nused to wear suited her much better, Mrs. Harsanyi thought. But such\r\ntrifles, after all, were accidental and remediable. She put her hand on\r\nthe girl's strong shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"How much the summer has done for you! Yes, you are a young lady at\r\nlast. Andor will be so glad to hear about you.\"\r\n\r\nThea looked about at the disorder of the familiar room. The pictures\r\nwere piled in a corner, the piano and the CHAISE LONGUE were gone. \"I\r\nsuppose I ought to be glad you have gone away,\" she said, \"but I'm not.\r\nIt's a fine thing for Mr. Harsanyi, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Harsanyi gave her a quick glance that said more than words. \"If you\r\nknew how long I have wanted to get him away from here, Miss Kronborg! He\r\nis never tired, never discouraged, now.\"\r\n\r\nThea sighed. \"I'm glad for that, then.\" Her eyes traveled over the faint\r\ndiscolorations on the walls where the pictures had hung. \"I may run away\r\nmyself. I don't know whether I can stand it here without you.\"\r\n\r\n\"We hope that you can come to New York to study before very long. We\r\nhave thought of that. And you must tell me how you are getting on with\r\nBowers. Andor will want to know all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess I get on more or less. But I don't like my work very well. It\r\nnever seems serious as my work with Mr. Harsanyi did. I play Bowers's\r\naccompaniments in the afternoons, you know. I thought I would learn a\r\ngood deal from the people who work with him, but I don't think I get\r\nmuch.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Harsanyi looked at her inquiringly. Thea took out a carefully\r\nfolded handkerchief from the bosom of her dress and began to draw the\r\ncorners apart. \"Singing doesn't seem to be a very brainy profession,\r\nMrs. Harsanyi,\" she said slowly. \"The people I see now are not a bit\r\nlike the ones I used to meet here. Mr. Harsanyi's pupils, even the dumb\r\nones, had more--well, more of everything, it seems to me. The people I\r\nhave to play accompaniments for are discouraging. The professionals,\r\nlike Katharine Priest and Miles Murdstone, are worst of all. If I have\r\nto play 'The Messiah' much longer for Mrs. Priest, I'll go out of my\r\nmind!\" Thea brought her foot down sharply on the bare floor.\r\n\r\nMrs. Harsanyi looked down at the foot in perplexity. \"You mustn't wear\r\nsuch high heels, my dear. They will spoil your walk and make you mince\r\nalong. Can't you at least learn to avoid what you dislike in these\r\nsingers? I was never able to care for Mrs. Priest's singing.\"\r\n\r\nThea was sitting with her chin lowered. Without moving her head she\r\nlooked up at Mrs. Harsanyi and smiled; a smile much too cold and\r\ndesperate to be seen on a young face, Mrs. Harsanyi felt. \"Mrs.\r\nHarsanyi, it seems to me that what I learn is just TO DISLIKE. I dislike\r\nso much and so hard that it tires me out. I've got no heart for\r\nanything.\" She threw up her head suddenly and sat in defiance, her hand\r\nclenched on the arm of the chair. \"Mr. Harsanyi couldn't stand these\r\npeople an hour, I know he couldn't. He'd put them right out of the\r\nwindow there, frizzes and feathers and all. Now, take that new soprano\r\nthey're all making such a fuss about, Jessie Darcey. She's going on tour\r\nwith a symphony orchestra and she's working up her repertory with\r\nBowers. She's singing some Schumann songs Mr. Harsanyi used to go over\r\nwith me. Well, I don't know what he WOULD do if he heard her.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if your own work goes well, and you know these people are wrong,\r\nwhy do you let them discourage you?\"\r\n\r\nThea shook her head. \"That's just what I don't understand myself. Only,\r\nafter I've heard them all afternoon, I come out frozen up. Somehow it\r\ntakes the shine off of everything. People want Jessie Darcey and the\r\nkind of thing she does; so what's the use?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Harsanyi smiled. \"That stile you must simply vault over. You must\r\nnot begin to fret about the successes of cheap people. After all,\r\nwhat have they to do with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if I had somebody like Mr. Harsanyi, perhaps I wouldn't fret\r\nabout them. He was the teacher for me. Please tell him so.\"\r\n\r\nThea rose and Mrs. Harsanyi took her hand again. \"I am sorry you have to\r\ngo through this time of discouragement. I wish Andor could talk to you,\r\nhe would understand it so well. But I feel like urging you to keep clear\r\nof Mrs. Priest and Jessie Darcey and all their works.\"\r\n\r\nThea laughed discordantly. \"No use urging me. I don't get on with them\r\nAT ALL. My spine gets like a steel rail when they come near me. I liked\r\nthem at first, you know. Their clothes and their manners were so fine,\r\nand Mrs. Priest IS handsome. But now I keep wanting to tell them how\r\nstupid they are. Seems like they ought to be informed, don't you think\r\nso?\" There was a flash of the shrewd grin that Mrs. Harsanyi remembered.\r\nThea pressed her hand. \"I must go now. I had to give my lesson hour this\r\nmorning to a Duluth woman who has come on to coach, and I must go and\r\nplay 'On Mighty Pens' for her. Please tell Mr. Harsanyi that I think\r\noratorio is a great chance for bluffers.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Harsanyi detained her. \"But he will want to know much more than\r\nthat about you. You are free at seven? Come back this evening, then, and\r\nwe will go to dinner somewhere, to some cheerful place. I think you need\r\na party.\"\r\n\r\nThea brightened. \"Oh, I do! I'll love to come; that will be like old\r\ntimes. You see,\" she lingered a moment, softening, \"I wouldn't mind if\r\nthere were only ONE of them I could really admire.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about Bowers?\" Mrs. Harsanyi asked as they were approaching the\r\nstairway.\r\n\r\n\"Well, there's nothing he loves like a good fakir, and nothing he hates\r\nlike a good artist. I always remember something Mr. Harsanyi said about\r\nhim. He said Bowers was the cold muffin that had been left on the\r\nplate.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Harsanyi stopped short at the head of the stairs and said\r\ndecidedly: \"I think Andor made a mistake. I can't believe that is the\r\nright atmosphere for you. It would hurt you more than most people. It's\r\nall wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Something's wrong,\" Thea called back as she clattered down the stairs\r\nin her high heels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nDURING that winter Thea lived in so many places that sometimes at night\r\nwhen she left Bowers's studio and emerged into the street she had to\r\nstop and think for a moment to remember where she was living now and\r\nwhat was the best way to get there.\r\n\r\nWhen she moved into a new place her eyes challenged the beds, the\r\ncarpets, the food, the mistress of the house. The boarding-houses were\r\nwretchedly conducted and Thea's complaints sometimes took an insulting\r\nform. She quarreled with one landlady after another and moved on. When\r\nshe moved into a new room, she was almost sure to hate it on sight and\r\nto begin planning to hunt another place before she unpacked her trunk.\r\nShe was moody and contemptuous toward her fellow boarders, except toward\r\nthe young men, whom she treated with a careless familiarity which they\r\nusually misunderstood. They liked her, however, and when she left the\r\nhouse after a storm, they helped her to move her things and came to see\r\nher after she got settled in a new place. But she moved so often that\r\nthey soon ceased to follow her. They could see no reason for keeping up\r\nwith a girl who, under her jocularity, was cold, self-centered, and\r\nunimpressionable. They soon felt that she did not admire them.\r\n\r\nThea used to waken up in the night and wonder why she was so unhappy.\r\nShe would have been amazed if she had known how much the people whom she\r\nmet in Bowers's studio had to do with her low spirits. She had never\r\nbeen conscious of those instinctive standards which are called ideals,\r\nand she did not know that she was suffering for them. She often found\r\nherself sneering when she was on a street-car, or when she was brushing\r\nout her hair before her mirror, as some inane remark or too familiar\r\nmannerism flitted across her mind.\r\n\r\nShe felt no creature kindness, no tolerant good-will for Mrs. Priest or\r\nJessie Darcey. After one of Jessie Darcey's concerts the glowing press\r\nnotices, and the admiring comments that floated about Bowers's studio,\r\ncaused Thea bitter unhappiness. It was not the torment of personal\r\njealousy. She had never thought of herself as even a possible rival of\r\nMiss Darcey. She was a poor music student, and Jessie Darcey was a\r\npopular and petted professional. Mrs. Priest, whatever one held against\r\nher, had a fine, big, showy voice and an impressive presence. She read\r\nindifferently, was inaccurate, and was always putting other people\r\nwrong, but she at least had the material out of which singers can be\r\nmade. But people seemed to like Jessie Darcey exactly because she could\r\nnot sing; because, as they put it, she was \"so natural and\r\nunprofessional.\" Her singing was pronounced \"artless,\" her voice\r\n\"birdlike.\" Miss Darcey was thin and awkward in person, with a sharp,\r\nsallow face. Thea noticed that her plainness was accounted to her\r\ncredit, and that people spoke of it affectionately. Miss Darcey was\r\nsinging everywhere just then; one could not help hearing about her. She\r\nwas backed by some of the packing-house people and by the Chicago\r\nNorthwestern Railroad. Only one critic raised his voice against her.\r\nThea went to several of Jessie Darcey's concerts. It was the first time\r\nshe had had an opportunity to observe the whims of the public which\r\nsingers live by interesting. She saw that people liked in Miss Darcey\r\nevery quality a singer ought not to have, and especially the nervous\r\ncomplacency that stamped her as a commonplace young woman. They seemed\r\nto have a warmer feeling for Jessie than for Mrs. Priest, an\r\naffectionate and cherishing regard. Chicago was not so very different\r\nfrom Moonstone, after all, and Jessie Darcey was only Lily Fisher under\r\nanother name.\r\n\r\nThea particularly hated to accompany for Miss Darcey because she sang\r\noff pitch and didn't mind it in the least. It was excruciating to sit\r\nthere day after day and hear her; there was something shameless and\r\nindecent about not singing true.\r\n\r\nOne morning Miss Darcey came by appointment to go over the programme for\r\nher Peoria concert. She was such a frail-looking girl that Thea ought to\r\nhave felt sorry for her. True, she had an arch, sprightly little manner,\r\nand a flash of salmon-pink on either brown cheek. But a narrow upper jaw\r\ngave her face a pinched look, and her eyelids were heavy and relaxed. By\r\nthe morning light, the purplish brown circles under her eyes were\r\npathetic enough, and foretold no long or brilliant future. A singer with\r\na poor digestion and low vitality; she needed no seer to cast her\r\nhoroscope. If Thea had ever taken the pains to study her, she would have\r\nseen that, under all her smiles and archness, poor Miss Darcey was\r\nreally frightened to death. She could not understand her success any\r\nmore than Thea could; she kept catching her breath and lifting her\r\neyebrows and trying to believe that it was true. Her loquacity was not\r\nnatural, she forced herself to it, and when she confided to you how many\r\ndefects she could overcome by her unusual command of head resonance, she\r\nwas not so much trying to persuade you as to persuade herself.\r\n\r\nWhen she took a note that was high for her, Miss Darcey always put her\r\nright hand out into the air, as if she were indicating height, or giving\r\nan exact measurement. Some early teacher had told her that she could\r\n\"place\" a tone more surely by the help of such a gesture, and she firmly\r\nbelieved that it was of great assistance to her. (Even when she was\r\nsinging in public, she kept her right hand down with difficulty,\r\nnervously clasping her white kid fingers together when she took a high\r\nnote. Thea could always see her elbows stiffen.) She unvaryingly\r\nexecuted this gesture with a smile of gracious confidence, as if she\r\nwere actually putting her finger on the tone: \"There it is, friends!\"\r\n\r\nThis morning, in Gounod's \"Ave Maria,\" as Miss Darcey approached her B\r\nnatural:--\r\n\r\nDANS--NOS--A--LAR--MES!\r\n\r\nOut went the hand, with the sure airy gesture, though it was little\r\nabove A she got with her voice, whatever she touched with her finger.\r\nOften Bowers let such things pass--with the right people--but this\r\nmorning he snapped his jaws together and muttered, \"God!\" Miss Darcey\r\ntried again, with the same gesture as of putting the crowning touch,\r\ntilting her head and smiling radiantly at Bowers, as if to say, \"It is\r\nfor you I do all this!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDANS--NOS A--LAR------MES!\r\n\r\nThis time she made B flat, and went on in the happy belief that she had\r\ndone well enough, when she suddenly found that her accompanist was not\r\ngoing on with her, and this put her out completely.\r\n\r\nShe turned to Thea, whose hands had fallen in her lap. \"Oh why did you\r\nstop just there! It IS too trying! Now we'd better go back to that other\r\nCRESCENDO and try it from there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon,\" Thea muttered. \"I thought you wanted to get that B\r\nnatural.\" She began again, as Miss Darcey indicated.\r\n\r\nAfter the singer was gone, Bowers walked up to Thea and asked languidly,\r\n\"Why do you hate Jessie so? Her little variations from pitch are between\r\nher and her public; they don't hurt you. Has she ever done anything to\r\nyou except be very agreeable?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she has done things to me,\" Thea retorted hotly.\r\n\r\nBowers looked interested. \"What, for example?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't explain, but I've got it in for her.\"\r\n\r\nBowers laughed. \"No doubt about that. I'll have to suggest that you\r\nconceal it a little more effectually. That is--necessary, Miss\r\nKronborg,\" he added, looking back over the shoulder of the overcoat he\r\nwas putting on.\r\n\r\nHe went out to lunch and Thea thought the subject closed. But late in\r\nthe afternoon, when he was taking his dyspepsia tablet and a glass of\r\nwater between lessons, he looked up and said in a voice ironically\r\ncoaxing:--\r\n\r\n\"Miss Kronborg, I wish you would tell me why you hate Jessie.\"\r\n\r\nTaken by surprise Thea put down the score she was reading and answered\r\nbefore she knew what she was saying, \"I hate her for the sake of what I\r\nused to think a singer might be.\"\r\n\r\nBowers balanced the tablet on the end of his long forefinger and\r\nwhistled softly. \"And how did you form your conception of what a singer\r\nought to be?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\" Thea flushed and spoke under her breath; \"but I suppose\r\nI got most of it from Harsanyi.\"\r\n\r\nBowers made no comment upon this reply, but opened the door for the next\r\npupil, who was waiting in the reception-room.\r\n\r\nIt was dark when Thea left the studio that night. She knew she had\r\noffended Bowers. Somehow she had hurt herself, too. She felt unequal to\r\nthe boarding-house table, the sneaking divinity student who sat next her\r\nand had tried to kiss her on the stairs last night. She went over to the\r\nwaterside of Michigan Avenue and walked along beside the lake. It was a\r\nclear, frosty winter night. The great empty space over the water was\r\nrestful and spoke of freedom. If she had any money at all, she would go\r\naway. The stars glittered over the wide black water. She looked up at\r\nthem wearily and shook her head. She believed that what she felt was\r\ndespair, but it was only one of the forms of hope. She felt, indeed, as\r\nif she were bidding the stars good-bye; but she was renewing a promise.\r\nThough their challenge is universal and eternal, the stars get no answer\r\nbut that,--the brief light flashed back to them from the eyes of the\r\nyoung who unaccountably aspire.\r\n\r\nThe rich, noisy, city, fat with food and drink, is a spent thing; its\r\nchief concern is its digestion and its little game of hide-and-seek with\r\nthe undertaker. Money and office and success are the consolations of\r\nimpotence. Fortune turns kind to such solid people and lets them suck\r\ntheir bone in peace. She flecks her whip upon flesh that is more alive,\r\nupon that stream of hungry boys and girls who tramp the streets of every\r\ncity, recognizable by their pride and discontent, who are the Future,\r\nand who possess the treasure of creative power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWHILE her living arrangements were so casual and fortuitous, Bowers's\r\nstudio was the one fixed thing in Thea's life. She went out from it to\r\nuncertainties, and hastened to it from nebulous confusion. She was more\r\ninfluenced by Bowers than she knew. Unconsciously she began to take on\r\nsomething of his dry contempt, and to share his grudge without\r\nunderstanding exactly what it was about. His cynicism seemed to her\r\nhonest, and the amiability of his pupils artificial. She admired his\r\ndrastic treatment of his dull pupils. The stupid deserved all they got,\r\nand more. Bowers knew that she thought him a very clever man.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon when Bowers came in from lunch Thea handed him a card on\r\nwhich he read the name, \"Mr. Philip Frederick Ottenburg.\"\r\n\r\n\"He said he would be in again to-morrow and that he wanted some time.\r\nWho is he? I like him better than the others.\"\r\n\r\nBowers nodded. \"So do I. He's not a singer. He's a beer prince: son of\r\nthe big brewer in St. Louis. He's been in Germany with his mother. I\r\ndidn't know he was back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he take lessons?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now and again. He sings rather well. He's at the head of the Chicago\r\nbranch of the Ottenburg business, but he can't stick to work and is\r\nalways running away. He has great ideas in beer, people tell me. He's\r\nwhat they call an imaginative business man; goes over to Bayreuth and\r\nseems to do nothing but give parties and spend money, and brings back\r\nmore good notions for the brewery than the fellows who sit tight dig out\r\nin five years. I was born too long ago to be much taken in by these\r\nchesty boys with flowered vests, but I like Fred, all the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I,\" said Thea positively.\r\n\r\nBowers made a sound between a cough and a laugh. \"Oh, he's a\r\nlady-killer, all right! The girls in here are always making eyes at him.\r\nYou won't be the first.\" He threw some sheets of music on the piano.\r\n\"Better look that over; accompaniment's a little tricky. It's for that\r\nnew woman from Detroit. And Mrs. Priest will be in this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nThea sighed. \"'I Know that my Redeemer Liveth'?\"\r\n\r\n\"The same. She starts on her concert tour next week, and we'll have a\r\nrest. Until then, I suppose we'll have to be going over her programme.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day Thea hurried through her luncheon at a German bakery and\r\ngot back to the studio at ten minutes past one. She felt sure that the\r\nyoung brewer would come early, before it was time for Bowers to arrive.\r\nHe had not said he would, but yesterday, when he opened the door to go,\r\nhe had glanced about the room and at her, and something in his eye had\r\nconveyed that suggestion.\r\n\r\nSure enough, at twenty minutes past one the door of the reception-room\r\nopened, and a tall, robust young man with a cane and an English hat and\r\nulster looked in expectantly. \"Ah--ha!\" he exclaimed, \"I thought if I\r\ncame early I might have good luck. And how are you to-day, Miss\r\nKronborg?\"\r\n\r\nThea was sitting in the window chair. At her left elbow there was a\r\ntable, and upon this table the young man sat down, holding his hat and\r\ncane in his hand, loosening his long coat so that it fell back from his\r\nshoulders. He was a gleaming, florid young fellow. His hair, thick and\r\nyellow, was cut very short, and he wore a closely trimmed beard, long\r\nenough on the chin to curl a little. Even his eyebrows were thick and\r\nyellow, like fleece. He had lively blue eyes--Thea looked up at them\r\nwith great interest as he sat chatting and swinging his foot\r\nrhythmically. He was easily familiar, and frankly so. Wherever people\r\nmet young Ottenburg, in his office, on shipboard, in a foreign hotel or\r\nrailway compartment, they always felt (and usually liked) that artless\r\npresumption which seemed to say, \"In this case we may waive formalities.\r\nWe really haven't time. This is to-day, but it will soon be to-morrow,\r\nand then we may be very different people, and in some other country.\" He\r\nhad a way of floating people out of dull or awkward situations, out of\r\ntheir own torpor or constraint or discouragement. It was a marked\r\npersonal talent, of almost incalculable value in the representative of a\r\ngreat business founded on social amenities. Thea had liked him yesterday\r\nfor the way in which he had picked her up out of herself and her German\r\ngrammar for a few exciting moments.\r\n\r\n\"By the way, will you tell me your first name, please? Thea? Oh, then\r\nyou ARE a Swede, sure enough! I thought so. Let me call you Miss Thea,\r\nafter the German fashion. You won't mind? Of course not!\" He usually\r\nmade his assumption of a special understanding seem a tribute to the\r\nother person and not to himself.\r\n\r\n\"How long have you been with Bowers here? Do you like the old grouch? So\r\ndo I. I've come to tell him about a new soprano I heard at Bayreuth.\r\nHe'll pretend not to care, but he does. Do you warble with him? Have you\r\nanything of a voice? Honest? You look it, you know. What are you going\r\nin for, something big? Opera?\"\r\n\r\nThea blushed crimson. \"Oh, I'm not going in for anything. I'm trying to\r\nlearn to sing at funerals.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg leaned forward. His eyes twinkled. \"I'll engage you to sing at\r\nmine. You can't fool me, Miss Thea. May I hear you take your lesson this\r\nafternoon?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you may not. I took it this morning.\"\r\n\r\nHe picked up a roll of music that lay behind him on the table. \"Is this\r\nyours? Let me see what you are doing.\"\r\n\r\nHe snapped back the clasp and began turning over the songs. \"All very\r\nfine, but tame. What's he got you at this Mozart stuff for? I shouldn't\r\nthink it would suit your voice. Oh, I can make a pretty good guess at\r\nwhat will suit you! This from 'Gioconda' is more in your line. What's\r\nthis Grieg? It looks interesting. TAK FOR DITT ROD. What does that\r\nmean?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Thanks for your Advice.' Don't you know it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; not at all. Let's try it.\" He rose, pushed open the door into the\r\nmusic-room, and motioned Thea to enter before him. She hung back.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't give you much of an idea of it. It's a big song.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg took her gently by the elbow and pushed her into the other\r\nroom. He sat down carelessly at the piano and looked over the music for\r\na moment. \"I think I can get you through it. But how stupid not to have\r\nthe German words. Can you really sing the Norwegian? What an infernal\r\nlanguage to sing. Translate the text for me.\" He handed her the music.\r\n\r\nThea looked at it, then at him, and shook her head. \"I can't. The truth\r\nis I don't know either English or Swedish very well, and Norwegian's\r\nstill worse,\" she said confidentially. She not infrequently refused to\r\ndo what she was asked to do, but it was not like her to explain her\r\nrefusal, even when she had a good reason.\r\n\r\n\"I understand. We immigrants never speak any language well. But you know\r\nwhat it means, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I do!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then don't frown at me like that, but tell me.\"\r\n\r\nThea continued to frown, but she also smiled. She was confused, but not\r\nembarrassed. She was not afraid of Ottenburg. He was not one of those\r\npeople who made her spine like a steel rail. On the contrary, he made\r\none venturesome.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it goes something like this: Thanks for your advice! But I prefer\r\nto steer my boat into the din of roaring breakers. Even if the journey\r\nis my last, I may find what I have never found before. Onward must I go,\r\nfor I yearn for the wild sea. I long to fight my way through the angry\r\nwaves, and to see how far, and how long I can make them carry me.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg took the music and began: \"Wait a moment. Is that too fast?\r\nHow do you take it? That right?\" He pulled up his cuffs and began the\r\naccompaniment again. He had become entirely serious, and he played with\r\nfine enthusiasm and with understanding.\r\n\r\nFred's talent was worth almost as much to old Otto Ottenburg as the\r\nsteady industry of his older sons. When Fred sang the Prize Song at an\r\ninterstate meet of the TURNVEREIN, ten thousand TURNERS went forth\r\npledged to Ottenburg beer.\r\n\r\nAs Thea finished the song Fred turned back to the first page, without\r\nlooking up from the music. \"Now, once more,\" he called. They began\r\nagain, and did not hear Bowers when he came in and stood in the doorway.\r\nHe stood still, blinking like an owl at their two heads shining in the\r\nsun. He could not see their faces, but there was something about his\r\ngirl's back that he had not noticed before: a very slight and yet very\r\nfree motion, from the toes up. Her whole back seemed plastic, seemed to\r\nbe moulding itself to the galloping rhythm of the song. Bowers perceived\r\nsuch things sometimes--unwillingly. He had known to-day that there was\r\nsomething afoot. The river of sound which had its source in his pupil\r\nhad caught him two flights down. He had stopped and listened with a kind\r\nof sneering admiration. From the door he watched her with a\r\nhalf-incredulous, half-malicious smile.\r\n\r\nWhen he had struck the keys for the last time, Ottenburg dropped his\r\nhands on his knees and looked up with a quick breath. \"I got you\r\nthrough. What a stunning song! Did I play it right?\"\r\n\r\nThea studied his excited face. There was a good deal of meaning in it,\r\nand there was a good deal in her own as she answered him. \"You suited\r\nme,\" she said ungrudgingly.\r\n\r\nAfter Ottenburg was gone, Thea noticed that Bowers was more agreeable\r\nthan usual. She had heard the young brewer ask Bowers to dine with him\r\nat his club that evening, and she saw that he looked forward to the\r\ndinner with pleasure. He dropped a remark to the effect that Fred knew\r\nas much about food and wines as any man in Chicago. He said this\r\nboastfully.\r\n\r\n\"If he's such a grand business man, how does he have time to run around\r\nlistening to singing-lessons?\" Thea asked suspiciously.\r\n\r\nAs she went home to her boarding-house through the February slush, she\r\nwished she were going to dine with them. At nine o'clock she looked up\r\nfrom her grammar to wonder what Bowers and Ottenburg were having to eat.\r\nAt that moment they were talking of her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHEA noticed that Bowers took rather more pains with her now that Fred\r\nOttenburg often dropped in at eleven-thirty to hear her lesson. After\r\nthe lesson the young man took Bowers off to lunch with him, and Bowers\r\nliked good food when another man paid for it. He encouraged Fred's\r\nvisits, and Thea soon saw that Fred knew exactly why.\r\n\r\nOne morning, after her lesson, Ottenburg turned to Bowers. \"If you'll\r\nlend me Miss Thea, I think I have an engagement for her. Mrs. Henry\r\nNathanmeyer is going to give three musical evenings in April, first\r\nthree Saturdays, and she has consulted me about soloists. For the first\r\nevening she has a young violinist, and she would be charmed to have Miss\r\nKronborg. She will pay fifty dollars. Not much, but Miss Thea would meet\r\nsome people there who might be useful. What do you say?\"\r\n\r\nBowers passed the question on to Thea. \"I guess you could use the fifty,\r\ncouldn't you, Miss Kronborg? You can easily work up some songs.\"\r\n\r\nThea was perplexed. \"I need the money awfully,\" she said frankly; \"but I\r\nhaven't got the right clothes for that sort of thing. I suppose I'd\r\nbetter try to get some.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg spoke up quickly, \"Oh, you'd make nothing out of it if you\r\nwent to buying evening clothes. I've thought of that. Mrs. Nathanmeyer\r\nhas a troop of daughters, a perfect seraglio, all ages and sizes. She'll\r\nbe glad to fit you out, if you aren't sensitive about wearing kosher\r\nclothes. Let me take you to see her, and you'll find that she'll arrange\r\nthat easily enough. I told her she must produce something nice, blue or\r\nyellow, and properly cut. I brought half a dozen Worth gowns through the\r\ncustoms for her two weeks ago, and she's not ungrateful. When can we go\r\nto see her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't any time free, except at night,\" Thea replied in some\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow evening, then? I shall call for you at eight. Bring all your\r\nsongs along; she will want us to give her a little rehearsal, perhaps.\r\nI'll play your accompaniments, if you've no objection. That will save\r\nmoney for you and for Mrs. Nathanmeyer. She needs it.\" Ottenburg\r\nchuckled as he took down the number of Thea's boarding-house.\r\n\r\nThe Nathanmeyers were so rich and great that even Thea had heard of\r\nthem, and this seemed a very remarkable opportunity. Ottenburg had\r\nbrought it about by merely lifting a finger, apparently. He was a beer\r\nprince sure enough, as Bowers had said.\r\n\r\nThe next evening at a quarter to eight Thea was dressed and waiting in\r\nthe boarding-house parlor. She was nervous and fidgety and found it\r\ndifficult to sit still on the hard, convex upholstery of the chairs. She\r\ntried them one after another, moving about the dimly lighted, musty\r\nroom, where the gas always leaked gently and sang in the burners. There\r\nwas no one in the parlor but the medical student, who was playing one of\r\nSousa's marches so vigorously that the china ornaments on the top of the\r\npiano rattled. In a few moments some of the pension-office girls would\r\ncome in and begin to two-step. Thea wished that Ottenburg would come and\r\nlet her escape. She glanced at herself in the long, somber mirror. She\r\nwas wearing her pale-blue broadcloth church dress, which was not\r\nunbecoming but was certainly too heavy to wear to anybody's house in the\r\nevening. Her slippers were run over at the heel and she had not had time\r\nto have them mended, and her white gloves were not so clean as they\r\nshould be. However, she knew that she would forget these annoying things\r\nas soon as Ottenburg came.\r\n\r\nMary, the Hungarian chambermaid, came to the door, stood between the\r\nplush portieres, beckoned to Thea, and made an inarticulate sound in her\r\nthroat. Thea jumped up and ran into the hall, where Ottenburg stood\r\nsmiling, his caped cloak open, his silk hat in his white-kid hand. The\r\nHungarian girl stood like a monument on her flat heels, staring at the\r\npink carnation in Ottenburg's coat. Her broad, pockmarked face wore the\r\nonly expression of which it was capable, a kind of animal wonder. As the\r\nyoung man followed Thea out, he glanced back over his shoulder through\r\nthe crack of the door; the Hun clapped her hands over her stomach,\r\nopened her mouth, and made another raucous sound in her throat.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't she awful?\" Thea exclaimed. \"I think she's half-witted. Can you\r\nunderstand her?\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg laughed as he helped her into the carriage. \"Oh, yes; I can\r\nunderstand her!\" He settled himself on the front seat opposite Thea.\r\n\"Now, I want to tell you about the people we are going to see. We may\r\nhave a musical public in this country some day, but as yet there are\r\nonly the Germans and the Jews. All the other people go to hear Jessie\r\nDarcey sing, 'O, Promise Me!' The Nathanmeyers are the finest kind of\r\nJews. If you do anything for Mrs. Henry Nathanmeyer, you must put\r\nyourself into her hands. Whatever she says about music, about clothes,\r\nabout life, will be correct. And you may feel at ease with her. She\r\nexpects nothing of people; she has lived in Chicago twenty years. If you\r\nwere to behave like the Magyar who was so interested in my buttonhole,\r\nshe would not be surprised. If you were to sing like Jessie Darcey, she\r\nwould not be surprised; but she would manage not to hear you again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would she? Well, that's the kind of people I want to find.\" Thea felt\r\nherself growing bolder.\r\n\r\n\"You will be all right with her so long as you do not try to be anything\r\nthat you are not. Her standards have nothing to do with Chicago. Her\r\nperceptions--or her grandmother's, which is the same thing--were keen\r\nwhen all this was an Indian village. So merely be yourself, and you will\r\nlike her. She will like you because the Jews always sense talent, and,\"\r\nhe added ironically, \"they admire certain qualities of feeling that are\r\nfound only in the white-skinned races.\"\r\n\r\nThea looked into the young man's face as the light of a street lamp\r\nflashed into the carriage. His somewhat academic manner amused her.\r\n\r\n\"What makes you take such an interest in singers?\" she asked curiously.\r\n\"You seem to have a perfect passion for hearing music-lessons. I wish I\r\ncould trade jobs with you!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not interested in singers.\" His tone was offended. \"I am interested\r\nin talent. There are only two interesting things in the world, anyhow;\r\nand talent is one of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the other?\" The question came meekly from the figure opposite\r\nhim. Another arc-light flashed in at the window.\r\n\r\nFred saw her face and broke into a laugh. \"Why, you're guying me, you\r\nlittle wretch! You won't let me behave properly.\" He dropped his gloved\r\nhand lightly on her knee, took it away and let it hang between his own.\r\n\"Do you know,\" he said confidentially, \"I believe I'm more in earnest\r\nabout all this than you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"About all what?\"\r\n\r\n\"All you've got in your throat there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I'm in earnest all right; only I never was much good at talking.\r\nJessie Darcey is the smooth talker. 'You notice the effect I get\r\nthere--' If she only got 'em, she'd be a wonder, you know!\"\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Nathanmeyer were alone in their great library. Their three\r\nunmarried daughters had departed in successive carriages, one to a\r\ndinner, one to a Nietszche club, one to a ball given for the girls\r\nemployed in the big department stores. When Ottenburg and Thea entered,\r\nHenry Nathanmeyer and his wife were sitting at a table at the farther\r\nend of the long room, with a reading-lamp and a tray of cigarettes and\r\ncordial-glasses between them. The overhead lights were too soft to bring\r\nout the colors of the big rugs, and none of the picture lights were on.\r\nOne could merely see that there were pictures there. Fred whispered that\r\nthey were Rousseaus and Corots, very fine ones which the old banker had\r\nbought long ago for next to nothing. In the hall Ottenburg had stopped\r\nThea before a painting of a woman eating grapes out of a paper bag, and\r\nhad told her gravely that there was the most beautiful Manet in the\r\nworld. He made her take off her hat and gloves in the hall, and looked\r\nher over a little before he took her in. But once they were in the\r\nlibrary he seemed perfectly satisfied with her and led her down the long\r\nroom to their hostess.\r\n\r\nMrs. Nathanmeyer was a heavy, powerful old Jewess, with a great\r\npompadour of white hair, a swarthy complexion, an eagle nose, and sharp,\r\nglittering eyes. She wore a black velvet dress with a long train, and a\r\ndiamond necklace and earrings. She took Thea to the other side of the\r\ntable and presented her to Mr. Nathanmeyer, who apologized for not\r\nrising, pointing to a slippered foot on a cushion; he said that he\r\nsuffered from gout. He had a very soft voice and spoke with an accent\r\nwhich would have been heavy if it had not been so caressing. He kept\r\nThea standing beside him for some time. He noticed that she stood\r\neasily, looked straight down into his face, and was not embarrassed.\r\nEven when Mrs. Nathanmeyer told Ottenburg to bring a chair for Thea, the\r\nold man did not release her hand, and she did not sit down. He admired\r\nher just as she was, as she happened to be standing, and she felt it. He\r\nwas much handsomer than his wife, Thea thought. His forehead was high,\r\nhis hair soft and white, his skin pink, a little puffy under his clear\r\nblue eyes. She noticed how warm and delicate his hands were, pleasant to\r\ntouch and beautiful to look at. Ottenburg had told her that Mr.\r\nNathanmeyer had a very fine collection of medals and cameos, and his\r\nfingers looked as if they had never touched anything but delicately cut\r\nsurfaces.\r\n\r\nHe asked Thea where Moonstone was; how many inhabitants it had; what her\r\nfather's business was; from what part of Sweden her grandfather came;\r\nand whether she spoke Swedish as a child. He was interested to hear that\r\nher mother's mother was still living, and that her grandfather had\r\nplayed the oboe. Thea felt at home standing there beside him; she felt\r\nthat he was very wise, and that he some way took one's life up and\r\nlooked it over kindly, as if it were a story. She was sorry when they\r\nleft him to go into the music-room.\r\n\r\nAs they reached the door of the music-room, Mrs. Nathanmeyer turned a\r\nswitch that threw on many lights. The room was even larger than the\r\nlibrary, all glittering surfaces, with two Steinway pianos.\r\n\r\nMrs. Nathanmeyer rang for her own maid. \"Selma will take you upstairs,\r\nMiss Kronborg, and you will find some dresses on the bed. Try several of\r\nthem, and take the one you like best. Selma will help you. She has a\r\ngreat deal of taste. When you are dressed, come down and let us go over\r\nsome of your songs with Mr. Ottenburg.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Thea went away with the maid, Ottenburg came up to Mrs.\r\nNathanmeyer and stood beside her, resting his hand on the high back of\r\nher chair.\r\n\r\n\"Well, GNADIGE FRAU, do you like her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so. I liked her when she talked to father. She will always get\r\non better with men.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg leaned over her chair. \"Prophetess! Do you see what I meant?\"\r\n\r\n\"About her beauty? She has great possibilities, but you can never tell\r\nabout those Northern women. They look so strong, but they are easily\r\nbattered. The face falls so early under those wide cheek-bones. A single\r\nidea--hate or greed, or even love--can tear them to shreds. She is\r\nnineteen? Well, in ten years she may have quite a regal beauty, or she\r\nmay have a heavy, discontented face, all dug out in channels. That will\r\ndepend upon the kind of ideas she lives with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or the kind of people?\" Ottenburg suggested.\r\n\r\nThe old Jewess folded her arms over her massive chest, drew back her\r\nshoulders, and looked up at the young man. \"With that hard glint in her\r\neye? The people won't matter much, I fancy. They will come and go. She\r\nis very much interested in herself--as she should be.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg frowned. \"Wait until you hear her sing. Her eyes are different\r\nthen. That gleam that comes in them is curious, isn't it? As you say,\r\nit's impersonal.\"\r\n\r\nThe object of this discussion came in, smiling. She had chosen neither\r\nthe blue nor the yellow gown, but a pale rose-color, with silver\r\nbutterflies. Mrs. Nathanmeyer lifted her lorgnette and studied her as\r\nshe approached. She caught the characteristic things at once: the free,\r\nstrong walk, the calm carriage of the head, the milky whiteness of the\r\ngirl's arms and shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that color is good for you,\" she said approvingly. \"The yellow one\r\nprobably killed your hair? Yes; this does very well indeed, so we need\r\nthink no more about it.\"\r\n\r\nThea glanced questioningly at Ottenburg. He smiled and bowed, seemed\r\nperfectly satisfied. He asked her to stand in the elbow of the piano, in\r\nfront of him, instead of behind him as she had been taught to do.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the hostess with feeling. \"That other position is\r\nbarbarous.\"\r\n\r\nThea sang an aria from 'Gioconda,' some songs by Schumann which she had\r\nstudied with Harsanyi, and the \"TAK FOR DIT ROD,\" which Ottenburg liked.\r\n\r\n\"That you must do again,\" he declared when they finished this song. \"You\r\ndid it much better the other day. You accented it more, like a dance or\r\na galop. How did you do it?\"\r\n\r\nThea laughed, glancing sidewise at Mrs. Nathanmeyer. \"You want it\r\nrough-house, do you? Bowers likes me to sing it more seriously, but it\r\nalways makes me think about a story my grandmother used to tell.\"\r\n\r\nFred pointed to the chair behind her. \"Won't you rest a moment and tell\r\nus about it? I thought you had some notion about it when you first sang\r\nit for me.\"\r\n\r\nThea sat down. \"In Norway my grandmother knew a girl who was awfully in\r\nlove with a young fellow. She went into service on a big dairy farm to\r\nmake enough money for her outfit. They were married at Christmastime,\r\nand everybody was glad, because they'd been sighing around about each\r\nother for so long. That very summer, the day before St. John's Day, her\r\nhusband caught her carrying on with another farm-hand. The next night\r\nall the farm people had a bonfire and a big dance up on the mountain,\r\nand everybody was dancing and singing. I guess they were all a little\r\ndrunk, for they got to seeing how near they could make the girls dance\r\nto the edge of the cliff. Ole--he was the girl's husband--seemed the\r\njolliest and the drunkest of anybody. He danced his wife nearer and\r\nnearer the edge of the rock, and his wife began to scream so that the\r\nothers stopped dancing and the music stopped; but Ole went right on\r\nsinging, and he danced her over the edge of the cliff and they fell\r\nhundreds of feet and were all smashed to pieces.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg turned back to the piano. \"That's the idea! Now, come Miss\r\nThea. Let it go!\"\r\n\r\nThea took her place. She laughed and drew herself up out of her corsets,\r\nthrew her shoulders high and let them drop again. She had never sung in\r\na low dress before, and she found it comfortable. Ottenburg jerked his\r\nhead and they began the song. The accompaniment sounded more than ever\r\nlike the thumping and scraping of heavy feet.\r\n\r\nWhen they stopped, they heard a sympathetic tapping at the end of the\r\nroom. Old Mr. Nathanmeyer had come to the door and was sitting back in\r\nthe shadow, just inside the library, applauding with his cane. Thea\r\nthrew him a bright smile. He continued to sit there, his slippered foot\r\non a low chair, his cane between his fingers, and she glanced at him\r\nfrom time to time. The doorway made a frame for him, and he looked like\r\na man in a picture, with the long, shadowy room behind him.\r\n\r\nMrs. Nathanmeyer summoned the maid again. \"Selma will pack that gown in\r\na box for you, and you can take it home in Mr. Ottenburg's carriage.\"\r\n\r\nThea turned to follow the maid, but hesitated. \"Shall I wear gloves?\"\r\nshe asked, turning again to Mrs. Nathanmeyer.\r\n\r\n\"No, I think not. Your arms are good, and you will feel freer without.\r\nYou will need light slippers, pink--or white, if you have them, will do\r\nquite as well.\"\r\n\r\nThea went upstairs with the maid and Mrs. Nathanmeyer rose, took\r\nOttenburg's arm, and walked toward her husband. \"That's the first real\r\nvoice I have heard in Chicago,\" she said decidedly. \"I don't count that\r\nstupid Priest woman. What do you say, father?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Nathanmeyer shook his white head and smiled softly, as if he were\r\nthinking about something very agreeable. \"SVENSK SOMMAR,\" he murmured.\r\n\"She is like a Swedish summer. I spent nearly a year there when I was a\r\nyoung man,\" he explained to Ottenburg.\r\n\r\nWhen Ottenburg got Thea and her big box into the carriage, it occurred\r\nto him that she must be hungry, after singing so much. When he asked\r\nher, she admitted that she was very hungry, indeed.\r\n\r\nHe took out his watch. \"Would you mind stopping somewhere with me? It's\r\nonly eleven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mind? Of course, I wouldn't mind. I wasn't brought up like that. I can\r\ntake care of myself.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg laughed. \"And I can take care of myself, so we can do lots of\r\njolly things together.\" He opened the carriage door and spoke to the\r\ndriver. \"I'm stuck on the way you sing that Grieg song,\" he declared.\r\n\r\nWhen Thea got into bed that night she told herself that this was the\r\nhappiest evening she had had in Chicago. She had enjoyed the\r\nNathanmeyers and their grand house, her new dress, and Ottenburg, her\r\nfirst real carriage ride, and the good supper when she was so hungry.\r\nAnd Ottenburg WAS jolly! He made you want to come back at him. You\r\nweren't always being caught up and mystified. When you started in with\r\nhim, you went; you cut the breeze, as Ray used to say. He had some go in\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip Frederick Ottenburg was the third son of the great brewer. His\r\nmother was Katarina Furst, the daughter and heiress of a brewing\r\nbusiness older and richer than Otto Ottenburg's. As a young woman she\r\nhad been a conspicuous figure in German-American society in New York,\r\nand not untouched by scandal. She was a handsome, headstrong girl, a\r\nrebellious and violent force in a provincial society. She was brutally\r\nsentimental and heavily romantic. Her free speech, her Continental\r\nideas, and her proclivity for championing new causes, even when she did\r\nnot know much about them, made her an object of suspicion. She was\r\nalways going abroad to seek out intellectual affinities, and was one of\r\nthe group of young women who followed Wagner about in his old age,\r\nkeeping at a respectful distance, but receiving now and then a gracious\r\nacknowledgment that he appreciated their homage. When the composer died,\r\nKatarina, then a matron with a family, took to her bed and saw no one\r\nfor a week.\r\n\r\nAfter having been engaged to an American actor, a Welsh socialist\r\nagitator, and a German army officer, Fraulein Furst at last placed\r\nherself and her great brewery interests into the trustworthy hands of\r\nOtto Ottenburg, who had been her suitor ever since he was a clerk,\r\nlearning his business in her father's office.\r\n\r\nHer first two sons were exactly like their father. Even as children they\r\nwere industrious, earnest little tradesmen. As Frau Ottenburg said, \"she\r\nhad to wait for her Fred, but she got him at last,\" the first man who\r\nhad altogether pleased her. Frederick entered Harvard when he was\r\neighteen. When his mother went to Boston to visit him, she not only got\r\nhim everything he wished for, but she made handsome and often\r\nembarrassing presents to all his friends. She gave dinners and supper\r\nparties for the Glee Club, made the crew break training, and was a\r\ngenerally disturbing influence. In his third year Fred left the\r\nuniversity because of a serious escapade which had somewhat hampered his\r\nlife ever since. He went at once into his father's business, where, in\r\nhis own way, he had made himself very useful.\r\n\r\nFred Ottenburg was now twenty-eight, and people could only say of him\r\nthat he had been less hurt by his mother's indulgence than most boys\r\nwould have been. He had never wanted anything that he could not have it,\r\nand he might have had a great many things that he had never wanted. He\r\nwas extravagant, but not prodigal. He turned most of the money his\r\nmother gave him into the business, and lived on his generous salary.\r\n\r\nFred had never been bored for a whole day in his life. When he was in\r\nChicago or St. Louis, he went to ballgames, prize-fights, and\r\nhorse-races. When he was in Germany, he went to concerts and to the\r\nopera. He belonged to a long list of sporting-clubs and hunting-clubs,\r\nand was a good boxer. He had so many natural interests that he had no\r\naffectations. At Harvard he kept away from the aesthetic circle that had\r\nalready discovered Francis Thompson. He liked no poetry but German\r\npoetry. Physical energy was the thing he was full to the brim of, and\r\nmusic was one of its natural forms of expression. He had a healthy love\r\nof sport and art, of eating and drinking. When he was in Germany, he\r\nscarcely knew where the soup ended and the symphony began.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nMARCH began badly for Thea. She had a cold during the first week, and\r\nafter she got through her church duties on Sunday she had to go to bed\r\nwith tonsilitis. She was still in the boarding-house at which young\r\nOttenburg had called when he took her to see Mrs. Nathanmeyer. She had\r\nstayed on there because her room, although it was inconvenient and very\r\nsmall, was at the corner of the house and got the sunlight.\r\n\r\nSince she left Mrs. Lorch, this was the first place where she had got\r\naway from a north light. Her rooms had all been as damp and mouldy as\r\nthey were dark, with deep foundations of dirt under the carpets, and\r\ndirty walls. In her present room there was no running water and no\r\nclothes closet, and she had to have the dresser moved out to make room\r\nfor her piano. But there were two windows, one on the south and one on\r\nthe west, a light wall-paper with morning-glory vines, and on the floor\r\na clean matting. The landlady had tried to make the room look cheerful,\r\nbecause it was hard to let. It was so small that Thea could keep it\r\nclean herself, after the Hun had done her worst. She hung her dresses on\r\nthe door under a sheet, used the washstand for a dresser, slept on a\r\ncot, and opened both the windows when she practiced. She felt less\r\nwalled in than she had in the other houses.\r\n\r\nWednesday was her third day in bed. The medical student who lived in the\r\nhouse had been in to see her, had left some tablets and a foamy gargle,\r\nand told her that she could probably go back to work on Monday. The\r\nlandlady stuck her head in once a day, but Thea did not encourage her\r\nvisits. The Hungarian chambermaid brought her soup and toast. She made a\r\nsloppy pretense of putting the room in order, but she was such a dirty\r\ncreature that Thea would not let her touch her cot; she got up every\r\nmorning and turned the mattress and made the bed herself. The exertion\r\nmade her feel miserably ill, but at least she could lie still\r\ncontentedly for a long while afterward. She hated the poisoned feeling\r\nin her throat, and no matter how often she gargled she felt unclean and\r\ndisgusting. Still, if she had to be ill, she was almost glad that she\r\nhad a contagious illness. Otherwise she would have been at the mercy of\r\nthe people in the house. She knew that they disliked her, yet now that\r\nshe was ill, they took it upon themselves to tap at her door, send her\r\nmessages, books, even a miserable flower or two. Thea knew that their\r\nsympathy was an expression of self-righteousness, and she hated them for\r\nit. The divinity student, who was always whispering soft things to her,\r\nsent her \"The Kreutzer Sonata.\"\r\n\r\nThe medical student had been kind to her: he knew that she did not want\r\nto pay a doctor. His gargle had helped her, and he gave her things to\r\nmake her sleep at night. But he had been a cheat, too. He had exceeded\r\nhis rights. She had no soreness in her chest, and had told him so\r\nclearly. All this thumping of her back, and listening to her breathing,\r\nwas done to satisfy personal curiosity. She had watched him with a\r\ncontemptuous smile. She was too sick to care; if it amused him--She made\r\nhim wash his hands before he touched her; he was never very clean. All\r\nthe same, it wounded her and made her feel that the world was a pretty\r\ndisgusting place. \"The Kreutzer Sonata\" did not make her feel any more\r\ncheerful. She threw it aside with hatred. She could not believe it was\r\nwritten by the same man who wrote the novel that had thrilled her.\r\n\r\nHer cot was beside the south window, and on Wednesday afternoon she lay\r\nthinking about the Harsanyis, about old Mr. Nathanmeyer, and about how\r\nshe was missing Fred Ottenburg's visits to the studio. That was much the\r\nworst thing about being sick. If she were going to the studio every day,\r\nshe might be having pleasant encounters with Fred. He was always running\r\naway, Bowers said, and he might be planning to go away as soon as Mrs.\r\nNathanmeyer's evenings were over. And here she was losing all this time!\r\n\r\nAfter a while she heard the Hun's clumsy trot in the hall, and then a\r\npound on the door. Mary came in, making her usual uncouth sounds,\r\ncarrying a long box and a big basket. Thea sat up in bed and tore off\r\nthe strings and paper. The basket was full of fruit, with a big Hawaiian\r\npineapple in the middle, and in the box there were layers of pink roses\r\nwith long, woody stems and dark-green leaves. They filled the room with\r\na cool smell that made another air to breathe. Mary stood with her apron\r\nfull of paper and cardboard. When she saw Thea take an envelope out from\r\nunder the flowers, she uttered an exclamation, pointed to the roses, and\r\nthen to the bosom of her own dress, on the left side. Thea laughed and\r\nnodded. She understood that Mary associated the color with Ottenburg's\r\nBOUTONNIERE. She pointed to the water pitcher,--she had nothing else big\r\nenough to hold the flowers,--and made Mary put it on the window sill\r\nbeside her.\r\n\r\nAfter Mary was gone Thea locked the door. When the landlady knocked, she\r\npretended that she was asleep. She lay still all afternoon and with\r\ndrowsy eyes watched the roses open. They were the first hothouse flowers\r\nshe had ever had. The cool fragrance they released was soothing, and as\r\nthe pink petals curled back, they were the only things between her and\r\nthe gray sky. She lay on her side, putting the room and the\r\nboarding-house behind her. Fred knew where all the pleasant things in\r\nthe world were, she reflected, and knew the road to them. He had keys to\r\nall the nice places in his pocket, and seemed to jingle them from time\r\nto time. And then, he was young; and her friends had always been old.\r\nHer mind went back over them. They had all been teachers; wonderfully\r\nkind, but still teachers. Ray Kennedy, she knew, had wanted to marry\r\nher, but he was the most protecting and teacher-like of them all. She\r\nmoved impatiently in her cot and threw her braids away from her hot\r\nneck, over her pillow. \"I don't want him for a teacher,\" she thought,\r\nfrowning petulantly out of the window. \"I've had such a string of them.\r\nI want him for a sweetheart.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\"THEA,\" said Fred Ottenburg one drizzly afternoon in April, while they\r\nsat waiting for their tea at a restaurant in the Pullman Building,\r\noverlooking the lake, \"what are you going to do this summer?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. Work, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"With Bowers, you mean? Even Bowers goes fishing for a month. Chicago's\r\nno place to work, in the summer. Haven't you made any plans?\"\r\n\r\nThea shrugged her shoulders. \"No use having any plans when you haven't\r\nany money. They are unbecoming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you going home?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \"No. It won't be comfortable there till I've got\r\nsomething to show for myself. I'm not getting on at all, you know. This\r\nyear has been mostly wasted.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're stale; that's what's the matter with you. And just now you're\r\ndead tired. You'll talk more rationally after you've had some tea. Rest\r\nyour throat until it comes.\" They were sitting by a window. As Ottenburg\r\nlooked at her in the gray light, he remembered what Mrs. Nathanmeyer had\r\nsaid about the Swedish face \"breaking early.\" Thea was as gray as the\r\nweather. Her skin looked sick. Her hair, too, though on a damp day it\r\ncurled charmingly about her face, looked pale.\r\n\r\nFred beckoned the waiter and increased his order for food. Thea did not\r\nhear him. She was staring out of the window, down at the roof of the Art\r\nInstitute and the green lions, dripping in the rain. The lake was all\r\nrolling mist, with a soft shimmer of robin's-egg blue in the gray. A\r\nlumber boat, with two very tall masts, was emerging gaunt and black out\r\nof the fog. When the tea came Thea ate hungrily, and Fred watched her.\r\nHe thought her eyes became a little less bleak. The kettle sang\r\ncheerfully over the spirit lamp, and she seemed to concentrate her\r\nattention upon that pleasant sound. She kept looking toward it\r\nlistlessly and indulgently, in a way that gave him a realization of her\r\nloneliness. Fred lit a cigarette and smoked thoughtfully. He and Thea\r\nwere alone in the quiet, dusky room full of white tables. In those days\r\nChicago people never stopped for tea. \"Come,\" he said at last, \"what\r\nwould you do this summer, if you could do whatever you wished?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd go a long way from here! West, I think. Maybe I could get some of\r\nmy spring back. All this cold, cloudy weather,\"--she looked out at the\r\nlake and shivered,--\"I don't know, it does things to me,\" she ended\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\nFred nodded. \"I know. You've been going down ever since you had\r\ntonsilitis. I've seen it. What you need is to sit in the sun and bake\r\nfor three months. You've got the right idea. I remember once when we\r\nwere having dinner somewhere you kept asking me about the Cliff-Dweller\r\nruins. Do they still interest you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course they do. I've always wanted to go down there--long before I\r\never got in for this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I told you, but my father owns a whole canyon full of\r\nCliff-Dweller ruins. He has a big worthless ranch down in Arizona, near\r\na Navajo reservation, and there's a canyon on the place they call\r\nPanther Canyon, chock full of that sort of thing. I often go down there\r\nto hunt. Henry Biltmer and his wife live there and keep a tidy place.\r\nHe's an old German who worked in the brewery until he lost his health.\r\nNow he runs a few cattle. Henry likes to do me a favor. I've done a few\r\nfor him.\" Fred drowned his cigarette in his saucer and studied Thea's\r\nexpression, which was wistful and intent, envious and admiring. He\r\ncontinued with satisfaction: \"If you went down there and stayed with\r\nthem for two or three months, they wouldn't let you pay anything. I\r\nmight send Henry a new gun, but even I couldn't offer him money for\r\nputting up a friend of mine. I'll get you transportation. It would make\r\na new girl of you. Let me write to Henry, and you pack your trunk.\r\nThat's all that's necessary. No red tape about it. What do you say,\r\nThea?\"\r\n\r\nShe bit her lip, and sighed as if she were waking up.\r\n\r\nFred crumpled his napkin impatiently. \"Well, isn't it easy enough?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the trouble; it's TOO easy. Doesn't sound probable. I'm not used\r\nto getting things for nothing.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg laughed. \"Oh, if that's all, I'll show you how to begin. You\r\nwon't get this for nothing, quite. I'll ask you to let me stop off and\r\nsee you on my way to California. Perhaps by that time you will be glad\r\nto see me. Better let me break the news to Bowers. I can manage him. He\r\nneeds a little transportation himself now and then. You must get\r\ncorduroy riding-things and leather leggings. There are a few snakes\r\nabout. Why do you keep frowning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't exactly see why you take the trouble. What do you get out\r\nof it? You haven't liked me so well the last two or three weeks.\"\r\n\r\nFred dropped his third cigarette and looked at his watch. \"If you don't\r\nsee that, it's because you need a tonic. I'll show you what I'll get out\r\nof it. Now I'm going to get a cab and take you home. You are too tired\r\nto walk a step. You'd better get to bed as soon as you get there. Of\r\ncourse, I don't like you so well when you're half anaesthetized all the\r\ntime. What have you been doing to yourself?\"\r\n\r\nThea rose. \"I don't know. Being bored eats the heart out of me, I\r\nguess.\" She walked meekly in front of him to the elevator. Fred noticed\r\nfor the hundredth time how vehemently her body proclaimed her state of\r\nfeeling. He remembered how remarkably brilliant and beautiful she had\r\nbeen when she sang at Mrs. Nathanmeyer's: flushed and gleaming, round\r\nand supple, something that couldn't be dimmed or downed. And now she\r\nseemed a moving figure of discouragement. The very waiters glanced at\r\nher apprehensively. It was not that she made a fuss, but her back was\r\nmost extraordinarily vocal. One never needed to see her face to know\r\nwhat she was full of that day. Yet she was certainly not mercurial. Her\r\nflesh seemed to take a mood and to \"set,\" like plaster. As he put her\r\ninto the cab, Fred reflected once more that he \"gave her up.\" He would\r\nattack her when his lance was brighter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV. THE ANCIENT PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE San Francisco Mountain lies in Northern Arizona, above Flagstaff,\r\nand its blue slopes and snowy summit entice the eye for a hundred miles\r\nacross the desert. About its base lie the pine forests of the Navajos,\r\nwhere the great red-trunked trees live out their peaceful centuries in\r\nthat sparkling air. The PINONS and scrub begin only where the forest\r\nends, where the country breaks into open, stony clearings and the\r\nsurface of the earth cracks into deep canyons. The great pines stand at\r\na considerable distance from each other. Each tree grows alone, murmurs\r\nalone, thinks alone. They do not intrude upon each other. The Navajos\r\nare not much in the habit of giving or of asking help. Their language is\r\nnot a communicative one, and they never attempt an interchange of\r\npersonality in speech. Over their forests there is the same inexorable\r\nreserve. Each tree has its exalted power to bear.\r\n\r\nThat was the first thing Thea Kronborg felt about the forest, as she\r\ndrove through it one May morning in Henry Biltmer's democrat wagon--and\r\nit was the first great forest she had ever seen. She had got off the\r\ntrain at Flagstaff that morning, rolled off into the high, chill air\r\nwhen all the pines on the mountain were fired by sunrise, so that she\r\nseemed to fall from sleep directly into the forest.\r\n\r\nOld Biltmer followed a faint wagon trail which ran southeast, and which,\r\nas they traveled, continually dipped lower, falling away from the high\r\nplateau on the slope of which Flagstaff sits. The white peak of the\r\nmountain, the snow gorges above the timber, now disappeared from time to\r\ntime as the road dropped and dropped, and the forest closed behind the\r\nwagon. More than the mountain disappeared as the forest closed thus.\r\nThea seemed to be taking very little through the wood with her. The\r\npersonality of which she was so tired seemed to let go of her. The high,\r\nsparkling air drank it up like blotting-paper. It was lost in the\r\nthrilling blue of the new sky and the song of the thin wind in the\r\nPINONS. The old, fretted lines which marked one off, which defined\r\nher,--made her Thea Kronborg, Bowers's accompanist, a soprano with a\r\nfaulty middle voice,--were all erased.\r\n\r\nSo far she had failed. Her two years in Chicago had not resulted in\r\nanything. She had failed with Harsanyi, and she had made no great\r\nprogress with her voice. She had come to believe that whatever Bowers\r\nhad taught her was of secondary importance, and that in the essential\r\nthings she had made no advance. Her student life closed behind her, like\r\nthe forest, and she doubted whether she could go back to it if she\r\ntried. Probably she would teach music in little country towns all her\r\nlife. Failure was not so tragic as she would have supposed; she was\r\ntired enough not to care.\r\n\r\nShe was getting back to the earliest sources of gladness that she could\r\nremember. She had loved the sun, and the brilliant solitudes of sand and\r\nsun, long before these other things had come along to fasten themselves\r\nupon her and torment her. That night, when she clambered into her big\r\nGerman feather bed, she felt completely released from the enslaving\r\ndesire to get on in the world. Darkness had once again the sweet wonder\r\nthat it had in childhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHEA'S life at the Ottenburg ranch was simple and full of light, like\r\nthe days themselves. She awoke every morning when the first fierce\r\nshafts of sunlight darted through the curtainless windows of her room at\r\nthe ranch house. After breakfast she took her lunch-basket and went down\r\nto the canyon. Usually she did not return until sunset.\r\n\r\nPanther Canyon was like a thousand others--one of those abrupt fissures\r\nwith which the earth in the Southwest is riddled; so abrupt that you\r\nmight walk over the edge of any one of them on a dark night and never\r\nknow what had happened to you. This canyon headed on the Ottenburg\r\nranch, about a mile from the ranch house, and it was accessible only at\r\nits head. The canyon walls, for the first two hundred feet below the\r\nsurface, were perpendicular cliffs, striped with even-running strata of\r\nrock. From there on to the bottom the sides were less abrupt, were\r\nshelving, and lightly fringed with PINONS and dwarf cedars. The effect\r\nwas that of a gentler canyon within a wilder one. The dead city lay at\r\nthe point where the perpendicular outer wall ceased and the V-shaped\r\ninner gorge began. There a stratum of rock, softer than those above, had\r\nbeen hollowed out by the action of time until it was like a deep groove\r\nrunning along the sides of the canyon. In this hollow (like a great fold\r\nin the rock) the Ancient People had built their houses of yellowish\r\nstone and mortar. The over-hanging cliff above made a roof two hundred\r\nfeet thick. The hard stratum below was an everlasting floor. The houses\r\nstood along in a row, like the buildings in a city block, or like a\r\nbarracks.\r\n\r\nIn both walls of the canyon the same streak of soft rock had been washed\r\nout, and the long horizontal groove had been built up with houses. The\r\ndead city had thus two streets, one set in either cliff, facing each\r\nother across the ravine, with a river of blue air between them.\r\n\r\nThe canyon twisted and wound like a snake, and these two streets went on\r\nfor four miles or more, interrupted by the abrupt turnings of the gorge,\r\nbut beginning again within each turn. The canyon had a dozen of these\r\nfalse endings near its head. Beyond, the windings were larger and less\r\nperceptible, and it went on for a hundred miles, too narrow,\r\nprecipitous, and terrible for man to follow it. The Cliff Dwellers liked\r\nwide canyons, where the great cliffs caught the sun. Panther Canyon had\r\nbeen deserted for hundreds of years when the first Spanish missionaries\r\ncame into Arizona, but the masonry of the houses was still wonderfully\r\nfirm; had crumbled only where a landslide or a rolling boulder had torn\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAll the houses in the canyon were clean with the cleanness of sun-baked,\r\nwind-swept places, and they all smelled of the tough little cedars that\r\ntwisted themselves into the very doorways. One of these rock-rooms Thea\r\ntook for her own. Fred had told her how to make it comfortable. The day\r\nafter she came old Henry brought over on one of the pack-ponies a roll\r\nof Navajo blankets that belonged to Fred, and Thea lined her cave with\r\nthem. The room was not more than eight by ten feet, and she could touch\r\nthe stone roof with her finger-tips. This was her old idea: a nest in a\r\nhigh cliff, full of sun. All morning long the sun beat upon her cliff,\r\nwhile the ruins on the opposite side of the canyon were in shadow. In\r\nthe afternoon, when she had the shade of two hundred feet of rock wall,\r\nthe ruins on the other side of the gulf stood out in the blazing\r\nsunlight. Before her door ran the narrow, winding path that had been the\r\nstreet of the Ancient People. The yucca and niggerhead cactus grew\r\neverywhere. From her doorstep she looked out on the ocher-colored slope\r\nthat ran down several hundred feet to the stream, and this hot rock was\r\nsparsely grown with dwarf trees. Their colors were so pale that the\r\nshadows of the little trees on the rock stood out sharper than the trees\r\nthemselves. When Thea first came, the chokecherry bushes were in\r\nblossom, and the scent of them was almost sickeningly sweet after a\r\nshower. At the very bottom of the canyon, along the stream, there was a\r\nthread of bright, flickering, golden-green,--cottonwood seedlings. They\r\nmade a living, chattering screen behind which she took her bath every\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThea went down to the stream by the Indian water trail. She had found a\r\nbathing-pool with a sand bottom, where the creek was damned by fallen\r\ntrees. The climb back was long and steep, and when she reached her\r\nlittle house in the cliff she always felt fresh delight in its comfort\r\nand inaccessibility. By the time she got there, the woolly red-and-gray\r\nblankets were saturated with sunlight, and she sometimes fell asleep as\r\nsoon as she stretched her body on their warm surfaces. She used to\r\nwonder at her own inactivity. She could lie there hour after hour in the\r\nsun and listen to the strident whir of the big locusts, and to the\r\nlight, ironical laughter of the quaking asps. All her life she had been\r\nhurrying and sputtering, as if she had been born behind time and had\r\nbeen trying to catch up. Now, she reflected, as she drew herself out\r\nlong upon the rugs, it was as if she were waiting for something to catch\r\nup with her. She had got to a place where she was out of the stream of\r\nmeaningless activity and undirected effort.\r\n\r\nHere she could lie for half a day undistracted, holding pleasant and\r\nincomplete conceptions in her mind--almost in her hands. They were\r\nscarcely clear enough to be called ideas. They had something to do with\r\nfragrance and color and sound, but almost nothing to do with words. She\r\nwas singing very little now, but a song would go through her head all\r\nmorning, as a spring keeps welling up, and it was like a pleasant\r\nsensation indefinitely prolonged. It was much more like a sensation than\r\nlike an idea, or an act of remembering. Music had never come to her in\r\nthat sensuous form before. It had always been a thing to be struggled\r\nwith, had always brought anxiety and exaltation and chagrin--never\r\ncontent and indolence. Thea began to wonder whether people could not\r\nutterly lose the power to work, as they can lose their voice or their\r\nmemory. She had always been a little drudge, hurrying from one task to\r\nanother--as if it mattered! And now her power to think seemed converted\r\ninto a power of sustained sensation. She could become a mere receptacle\r\nfor heat, or become a color, like the bright lizards that darted about\r\non the hot stones outside her door; or she could become a continuous\r\nrepetition of sound, like the cicadas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE faculty of observation was never highly developed in Thea Kronborg.\r\nA great deal escaped her eye as she passed through the world. But the\r\nthings which were for her, she saw; she experienced them physically and\r\nremembered them as if they had once been a part of herself. The roses\r\nshe used to see in the florists' shops in Chicago were merely roses. But\r\nwhen she thought of the moonflowers that grew over Mrs. Tellamantez's\r\ndoor, it was as if she had been that vine and had opened up in white\r\nflowers every night. There were memories of light on the sand hills, of\r\nmasses of prickly-pear blossoms she had found in the desert in early\r\nchildhood, of the late afternoon sun pouring through the grape leaves\r\nand the mint bed in Mrs. Kohler's garden, which she would never lose.\r\nThese recollections were a part of her mind and personality. In Chicago\r\nshe had got almost nothing that went into her subconscious self and took\r\nroot there. But here, in Panther Canyon, there were again things which\r\nseemed destined for her.\r\n\r\nPanther Canyon was the home of innumerable swallows. They built nests in\r\nthe wall far above the hollow groove in which Thea's own rock chamber\r\nlay. They seldom ventured above the rim of the canyon, to the flat,\r\nwind-swept tableland. Their world was the blue air-river between the\r\ncanyon walls. In that blue gulf the arrow-shaped birds swam all day\r\nlong, with only an occasional movement of the wings. The only sad thing\r\nabout them was their timidity; the way in which they lived their lives\r\nbetween the echoing cliffs and never dared to rise out of the shadow of\r\nthe canyon walls. As they swam past her door, Thea often felt how easy\r\nit would be to dream one's life out in some cleft in the world.\r\n\r\nFrom the ancient dwelling there came always a dignified, unobtrusive\r\nsadness; now stronger, now fainter,--like the aromatic smell which the\r\ndwarf cedars gave out in the sun,--but always present, a part of the air\r\none breathed. At night, when Thea dreamed about the canyon,--or in the\r\nearly morning when she hurried toward it, anticipating it,--her\r\nconception of it was of yellow rocks baking in sunlight, the swallows,\r\nthe cedar smell, and that peculiar sadness--a voice out of the past, not\r\nvery loud, that went on saying a few simple things to the solitude\r\neternally.\r\n\r\nStanding up in her lodge, Thea could with her thumb nail dislodge flakes\r\nof carbon from the rock roof--the cooking-smoke of the Ancient People.\r\nThey were that near! A timid, nest-building folk, like the swallows. How\r\noften Thea remembered Ray Kennedy's moralizing about the cliff cities.\r\nHe used to say that he never felt the hardness of the human struggle or\r\nthe sadness of history as he felt it among those ruins. He used to say,\r\ntoo, that it made one feel an obligation to do one's best. On the first\r\nday that Thea climbed the water trail she began to have intuitions about\r\nthe women who had worn the path, and who had spent so great a part of\r\ntheir lives going up and down it. She found herself trying to walk as\r\nthey must have walked, with a feeling in her feet and knees and loins\r\nwhich she had never known before,--which must have come up to her out of\r\nthe accustomed dust of that rocky trail. She could feel the weight of an\r\nIndian baby hanging to her back as she climbed.\r\n\r\nThe empty houses, among which she wandered in the afternoon, the\r\nblanketed one in which she lay all morning, were haunted by certain\r\nfears and desires; feelings about warmth and cold and water and physical\r\nstrength. It seemed to Thea that a certain understanding of those old\r\npeople came up to her out of the rock shelf on which she lay; that\r\ncertain feelings were transmitted to her, suggestions that were simple,\r\ninsistent, and monotonous, like the beating of Indian drums. They were\r\nnot expressible in words, but seemed rather to translate themselves into\r\nattitudes of body, into degrees of muscular tension or relaxation; the\r\nnaked strength of youth, sharp as the sunshafts; the crouching\r\ntimorousness of age, the sullenness of women who waited for their\r\ncaptors. At the first turning of the canyon there was a half-ruined\r\ntower of yellow masonry, a watch-tower upon which the young men used to\r\nentice eagles and snare them with nets. Sometimes for a whole morning\r\nThea could see the coppery breast and shoulders of an Indian youth there\r\nagainst the sky; see him throw the net, and watch the struggle with the\r\neagle.\r\n\r\nOld Henry Biltmer, at the ranch, had been a great deal among the Pueblo\r\nIndians who are the descendants of the Cliff-Dwellers. After supper he\r\nused to sit and smoke his pipe by the kitchen stove and talk to Thea\r\nabout them. He had never found any one before who was interested in his\r\nruins. Every Sunday the old man prowled about in the canyon, and he had\r\ncome to know a good deal more about it than he could account for. He had\r\ngathered up a whole chestful of Cliff-Dweller relics which he meant to\r\ntake back to Germany with him some day. He taught Thea how to find\r\nthings among the ruins: grinding-stones, and drills and needles made of\r\nturkey-bones. There were fragments of pottery everywhere. Old Henry\r\nexplained to her that the Ancient People had developed masonry and\r\npottery far beyond any other crafts. After they had made houses for\r\nthemselves, the next thing was to house the precious water. He explained\r\nto her how all their customs and ceremonies and their religion went back\r\nto water. The men provided the food, but water was the care of the\r\nwomen. The stupid women carried water for most of their lives; the\r\ncleverer ones made the vessels to hold it. Their pottery was their most\r\ndirect appeal to water, the envelope and sheath of the precious element\r\nitself. The strongest Indian need was expressed in those graceful jars,\r\nfashioned slowly by hand, without the aid of a wheel.\r\n\r\nWhen Thea took her bath at the bottom of the canyon, in the sunny pool\r\nbehind the screen of cottonwoods, she sometimes felt as if the water\r\nmust have sovereign qualities, from having been the object of so much\r\nservice and desire. That stream was the only living thing left of the\r\ndrama that had been played out in the canyon centuries ago. In the\r\nrapid, restless heart of it, flowing swifter than the rest, there was a\r\ncontinuity of life that reached back into the old time. The glittering\r\nthread of current had a kind of lightly worn, loosely knit personality,\r\ngraceful and laughing. Thea's bath came to have a ceremonial gravity.\r\nThe atmosphere of the canyon was ritualistic.\r\n\r\nOne morning, as she was standing upright in the pool, splashing water\r\nbetween her shoulder-blades with a big sponge, something flashed through\r\nher mind that made her draw herself up and stand still until the water\r\nhad quite dried upon her flushed skin. The stream and the broken\r\npottery: what was any art but an effort to make a sheath, a mould in\r\nwhich to imprison for a moment the shining, elusive element which is\r\nlife itself,--life hurrying past us and running away, too strong to\r\nstop, too sweet to lose? The Indian women had held it in their jars. In\r\nthe sculpture she had seen in the Art Institute, it had been caught in a\r\nflash of arrested motion. In singing, one made a vessel of one's throat\r\nand nostrils and held it on one's breath, caught the stream in a scale\r\nof natural intervals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHEA had a superstitious feeling about the potsherds, and liked better\r\nto leave them in the dwellings where she found them. If she took a few\r\nbits back to her own lodge and hid them under the blankets, she did it\r\nguiltily, as if she were being watched. She was a guest in these houses,\r\nand ought to behave as such. Nearly every afternoon she went to the\r\nchambers which contained the most interesting fragments of pottery, sat\r\nand looked at them for a while. Some of them were beautifully decorated.\r\nThis care, expended upon vessels that could not hold food or water any\r\nbetter for the additional labor put upon them, made her heart go out to\r\nthose ancient potters. They had not only expressed their desire, but\r\nthey had expressed it as beautifully as they could. Food, fire, water,\r\nand something else--even here, in this crack in the world, so far back\r\nin the night of the past! Down here at the beginning that painful thing\r\nwas already stirring; the seed of sorrow, and of so much delight.\r\n\r\nThere were jars done in a delicate overlay, like pine cones; and there\r\nwere many patterns in a low relief, like basket-work. Some of the\r\npottery was decorated in color, red and brown, black and white, in\r\ngraceful geometrical patterns. One day, on a fragment of a shallow bowl,\r\nshe found a crested serpent's head, painted in red on terra-cotta. Again\r\nshe found half a bowl with a broad band of white cliff-houses painted on\r\na black ground. They were scarcely conventionalized at all; there they\r\nwere in the black border, just as they stood in the rock before her. It\r\nbrought her centuries nearer to these people to find that they saw their\r\nhouses exactly as she saw them.\r\n\r\nYes, Ray Kennedy was right. All these things made one feel that one\r\nought to do one's best, and help to fulfill some desire of the dust that\r\nslept there. A dream had been dreamed there long ago, in the night of\r\nages, and the wind had whispered some promise to the sadness of the\r\nsavage. In their own way, those people had felt the beginnings of what\r\nwas to come. These potsherds were like fetters that bound one to a long\r\nchain of human endeavor.\r\n\r\nNot only did the world seem older and richer to Thea now, but she\r\nherself seemed older. She had never been alone for so long before, or\r\nthought so much. Nothing had ever engrossed her so deeply as the daily\r\ncontemplation of that line of pale-yellow houses tucked into the wrinkle\r\nof the cliff. Moonstone and Chicago had become vague. Here everything\r\nwas simple and definite, as things had been in childhood. Her mind was\r\nlike a ragbag into which she had been frantically thrusting whatever she\r\ncould grab. And here she must throw this lumber away. The things that\r\nwere really hers separated themselves from the rest. Her ideas were\r\nsimplified, became sharper and clearer. She felt united and strong.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Thea had been at the Ottenburg ranch for two months, she got a\r\nletter from Fred announcing that he \"might be along at almost any time\r\nnow.\" The letter came at night, and the next morning she took it down\r\ninto the canyon with her. She was delighted that he was coming soon. She\r\nhad never felt so grateful to any one, and she wanted to tell him\r\neverything that had happened to her since she had been there--more than\r\nhad happened in all her life before. Certainly she liked Fred better\r\nthan any one else in the world. There was Harsanyi, of course--but\r\nHarsanyi was always tired. Just now, and here, she wanted some one who\r\nhad never been tired, who could catch an idea and run with it.\r\n\r\nShe was ashamed to think what an apprehensive drudge she must always\r\nhave seemed to Fred, and she wondered why he had concerned himself about\r\nher at all. Perhaps she would never be so happy or so good-looking\r\nagain, and she would like Fred to see her, for once, at her best. She\r\nhad not been singing much, but she knew that her voice was more\r\ninteresting than it had ever been before. She had begun to understand\r\nthat--with her, at least--voice was, first of all, vitality; a lightness\r\nin the body and a driving power in the blood. If she had that, she could\r\nsing. When she felt so keenly alive, lying on that insensible shelf of\r\nstone, when her body bounded like a rubber ball away from its hardness,\r\nthen she could sing. This, too, she could explain to Fred. He would know\r\nwhat she meant.\r\n\r\nAnother week passed. Thea did the same things as before, felt the same\r\ninfluences, went over the same ideas; but there was a livelier movement\r\nin her thoughts, and a freshening of sensation, like the brightness\r\nwhich came over the underbrush after a shower. A persistent\r\naffirmation--or denial--was going on in her, like the tapping of the\r\nwoodpecker in the one tall pine tree across the chasm. Musical phrases\r\ndrove each other rapidly through her mind, and the song of the cicada\r\nwas now too long and too sharp. Everything seemed suddenly to take the\r\nform of a desire for action.\r\n\r\nIt was while she was in this abstracted state, waiting for the clock to\r\nstrike, that Thea at last made up her mind what she was going to try to\r\ndo in the world, and that she was going to Germany to study without\r\nfurther loss of time. Only by the merest chance had she ever got to\r\nPanther Canyon. There was certainly no kindly Providence that directed\r\none's life; and one's parents did not in the least care what became of\r\none, so long as one did not misbehave and endanger their comfort. One's\r\nlife was at the mercy of blind chance. She had better take it in her own\r\nhands and lose everything than meekly draw the plough under the rod of\r\nparental guidance. She had seen it when she was at home last\r\nsummer,--the hostility of comfortable, self-satisfied people toward any\r\nserious effort. Even to her father it seemed indecorous. Whenever she\r\nspoke seriously, he looked apologetic. Yet she had clung fast to\r\nwhatever was left of Moonstone in her mind. No more of that! The\r\nCliff-Dwellers had lengthened her past. She had older and higher\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nONE Sunday afternoon late in July old Henry Biltmer was rheumatically\r\ndescending into the head of the canyon. The Sunday before had been one\r\nof those cloudy days--fortunately rare--when the life goes out of that\r\ncountry and it becomes a gray ghost, an empty, shivering uncertainty.\r\nHenry had spent the day in the barn; his canyon was a reality only when\r\nit was flooded with the light of its great lamp, when the yellow rocks\r\ncast purple shadows, and the resin was fairly cooking in the corkscrew\r\ncedars. The yuccas were in blossom now. Out of each clump of sharp\r\nbayonet leaves rose a tall stalk hung with greenish-white bells with\r\nthick, fleshy petals. The niggerhead cactus was thrusting its crimson\r\nblooms up out of every crevice in the rocks.\r\n\r\nHenry had come out on the pretext of hunting a spade and pick-axe that\r\nyoung Ottenburg had borrowed, but he was keeping his eyes open. He was\r\nreally very curious about the new occupants of the canyon, and what they\r\nfound to do there all day long. He let his eye travel along the gulf for\r\na mile or so to the first turning, where the fissure zigzagged out and\r\nthen receded behind a stone promontory on which stood the yellowish,\r\ncrumbling ruin of the old watch-tower.\r\n\r\nFrom the base of this tower, which now threw its shadow forward, bits of\r\nrock kept flying out into the open gulf--skating upon the air until they\r\nlost their momentum, then falling like chips until they rang upon the\r\nledges at the bottom of the gorge or splashed into the stream. Biltmer\r\nshaded his eyes with his hand. There on the promontory, against the\r\ncream-colored cliff, were two figures nimbly moving in the light, both\r\nslender and agile, entirely absorbed in their game. They looked like two\r\nboys. Both were hatless and both wore white shirts.\r\n\r\nHenry forgot his pick-axe and followed the trail before the cliff-houses\r\ntoward the tower. Behind the tower, as he well knew, were heaps of\r\nstones, large and small, piled against the face of the cliff. He had\r\nalways believed that the Indian watchmen piled them there for\r\nammunition. Thea and Fred had come upon these missiles and were throwing\r\nthem for distance. As Biltmer approached he could hear them laughing,\r\nand he caught Thea's voice, high and excited, with a ring of vexation in\r\nit. Fred was teaching her to throw a heavy stone like a discus. When it\r\nwas Fred's turn, he sent a triangular-shaped stone out into the air with\r\nconsiderable skill. Thea watched it enviously, standing in a\r\nhalf-defiant posture, her sleeves rolled above her elbows and her face\r\nflushed with heat and excitement. After Fred's third missile had rung\r\nupon the rocks below, she snatched up a stone and stepped impatiently\r\nout on the ledge in front of him. He caught her by the elbows and pulled\r\nher back.\r\n\r\n\"Not so close, you silly! You'll spin yourself off in a minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"You went that close. There's your heel-mark,\" she retorted.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I know how. That makes a difference.\" He drew a mark in the dust\r\nwith his toe. \"There, that's right. Don't step over that. Pivot yourself\r\non your spine, and make a half turn. When you've swung your length, let\r\nit go.\"\r\n\r\nThea settled the flat piece of rock between her wrist and fingers, faced\r\nthe cliff wall, stretched her arm in position, whirled round on her left\r\nfoot to the full stretch of her body, and let the missile spin out over\r\nthe gulf. She hung expectantly in the air, forgetting to draw back her\r\narm, her eyes following the stone as if it carried her fortunes with it.\r\nHer comrade watched her; there weren't many girls who could show a line\r\nlike that from the toe to the thigh, from the shoulder to the tip of the\r\noutstretched hand. The stone spent itself and began to fall. Thea drew\r\nback and struck her knee furiously with her palm.\r\n\r\n\"There it goes again! Not nearly so far as yours. What IS the matter\r\nwith me? Give me another.\" She faced the cliff and whirled again. The\r\nstone spun out, not quite so far as before.\r\n\r\nOttenburg laughed. \"Why do you keep on working AFTER you've thrown it?\r\nYou can't help it along then.\"\r\n\r\nWithout replying, Thea stooped and selected another stone, took a deep\r\nbreath and made another turn. Fred watched the disk, exclaiming, \"Good\r\ngirl! You got past the pine that time. That's a good throw.\"\r\n\r\nShe took out her handkerchief and wiped her glowing face and throat,\r\npausing to feel her right shoulder with her left hand.\r\n\r\n\"Ah--ha, you've made yourself sore, haven't you? What did I tell you?\r\nYou go at things too hard. I'll tell you what I'm going to do, Thea,\"\r\nFred dusted his hands and began tucking in the blouse of his shirt, \"I'm\r\ngoing to make some single-sticks and teach you to fence. You'd be all\r\nright there. You're light and quick and you've got lots of drive in you.\r\nI'd like to have you come at me with foils; you'd look so fierce,\" he\r\nchuckled.\r\n\r\nShe turned away from him and stubbornly sent out another stone, hanging\r\nin the air after its flight. Her fury amused Fred, who took all games\r\nlightly and played them well. She was breathing hard, and little beads\r\nof moisture had gathered on her upper lip. He slipped his arm about her.\r\n\"If you will look as pretty as that--\" he bent his head and kissed her.\r\nThea was startled, gave him an angry push, drove at him with her free\r\nhand in a manner quite hostile. Fred was on his mettle in an instant. He\r\npinned both her arms down and kissed her resolutely.\r\n\r\nWhen he released her, she turned away and spoke over her shoulder. \"That\r\nwas mean of you, but I suppose I deserved what I got.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say you did deserve it,\" Fred panted, \"turning savage on me\r\nlike that! I should say you did deserve it!\"\r\n\r\nHe saw her shoulders harden. \"Well, I just said I deserved it, didn't I?\r\nWhat more do you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want you to tell me why you flew at me like that! You weren't\r\nplaying; you looked as if you'd like to murder me.\"\r\n\r\nShe brushed back her hair impatiently. \"I didn't mean anything, really.\r\nYou interrupted me when I was watching the stone. I can't jump from one\r\nthing to another. I pushed you without thinking.\"\r\n\r\nFred thought her back expressed contrition. He went up to her, stood\r\nbehind her with his chin above her shoulder, and said something in her\r\near. Thea laughed and turned toward him. They left the stone-pile\r\ncarelessly, as if they had never been interested in it, rounded the\r\nyellow tower, and disappeared into the second turn of the canyon, where\r\nthe dead city, interrupted by the jutting promontory, began again.\r\n\r\nOld Biltmer had been somewhat embarrassed by the turn the game had\r\ntaken. He had not heard their conversation, but the pantomime against\r\nthe rocks was clear enough. When the two young people disappeared, their\r\nhost retreated rapidly toward the head of the canyon.\r\n\r\n\"I guess that young lady can take care of herself,\" he chuckled. \"Young\r\nFred, though, he has quite a way with them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nDAY was breaking over Panther Canyon. The gulf was cold and full of\r\nheavy, purplish twilight. The wood smoke which drifted from one of the\r\ncliff-houses hung in a blue scarf across the chasm, until the draft\r\ncaught it and whirled it away. Thea was crouching in the doorway of her\r\nrock house, while Ottenburg looked after the crackling fire in the next\r\ncave. He was waiting for it to burn down to coals before he put the\r\ncoffee on to boil.\r\n\r\nThey had left the ranch house that morning a little after three o'clock,\r\nhaving packed their camp equipment the day before, and had crossed the\r\nopen pasture land with their lantern while the stars were still bright.\r\nDuring the descent into the canyon by lantern-light, they were chilled\r\nthrough their coats and sweaters. The lantern crept slowly along the\r\nrock trail, where the heavy air seemed to offer resistance. The voice of\r\nthe stream at the bottom of the gorge was hollow and threatening, much\r\nlouder and deeper than it ever was by day--another voice altogether. The\r\nsullenness of the place seemed to say that the world could get on very\r\nwell without people, red or white; that under the human world there was\r\na geological world, conducting its silent, immense operations which were\r\nindifferent to man. Thea had often seen the desert sunrise,--a\r\nlighthearted affair, where the sun springs out of bed and the world is\r\ngolden in an instant. But this canyon seemed to waken like an old man,\r\nwith rheum and stiffness of the joints, with heaviness, and a dull,\r\nmalignant mind. She crouched against the wall while the stars faded, and\r\nthought what courage the early races must have had to endure so much for\r\nthe little they got out of life.\r\n\r\nAt last a kind of hopefulness broke in the air. In a moment the\r\npine trees up on the edge of the rim were flashing with coppery\r\nfire. The thin red clouds which hung above their pointed tops began to\r\nboil and move rapidly, weaving in and out like smoke. The swallows\r\ndarted out of their rock houses as at a signal, and flew upward, toward\r\nthe rim. Little brown birds began to chirp in the bushes along the\r\nwatercourse down at the bottom of the ravine, where everything was still\r\ndusky and pale. At first the golden light seemed to hang like a wave\r\nupon the rim of the canyon; the trees and bushes up there, which one\r\nscarcely noticed at noon, stood out magnified by the slanting rays.\r\nLong, thin streaks of light began to reach quiveringly down into the\r\ncanyon. The red sun rose rapidly above the tops of the blazing pines,\r\nand its glow burst into the gulf, about the very doorstep on which Thea\r\nsat. It bored into the wet, dark underbrush. The dripping cherry bushes,\r\nthe pale aspens, and the frosty PINONS were glittering and trembling,\r\nswimming in the liquid gold. All the pale, dusty little herbs of the\r\nbean family, never seen by any one but a botanist, became for a moment\r\nindividual and important, their silky leaves quite beautiful with dew\r\nand light. The arch of sky overhead, heavy as lead a little while\r\nbefore, lifted, became more and more transparent, and one could look up\r\ninto depths of pearly blue.\r\n\r\nThe savor of coffee and bacon mingled with the smell of wet cedars\r\ndrying, and Fred called to Thea that he was ready for her. They sat down\r\nin the doorway of his kitchen, with the warmth of the live coals behind\r\nthem and the sunlight on their faces, and began their breakfast, Mrs.\r\nBiltmer's thick coffee cups and the cream bottle between them, the\r\ncoffee-pot and frying-pan conveniently keeping hot among the embers.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you were going back on the whole proposition, Thea, when you\r\nwere crawling along with that lantern. I couldn't get a word out of\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. I was cold and hungry, and I didn't believe there was going to\r\nbe any morning, anyway. Didn't you feel queer, at all?\"\r\n\r\nFred squinted above his smoking cup. \"Well, I am never strong for\r\ngetting up before the sun. The world looks unfurnished. When I first lit\r\nthe fire and had a square look at you, I thought I'd got the wrong girl.\r\nPale, grim--you were a sight!\"\r\n\r\nThea leaned back into the shadow of the rock room and warmed her hands\r\nover the coals. \"It was dismal enough. How warm these walls are, all the\r\nway round; and your breakfast is so good. I'm all right now, Fred.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you're all right now.\" Fred lit a cigarette and looked at her\r\ncritically as her head emerged into the sun again. \"You get up every\r\nmorning just a little bit handsomer than you were the day before. I'd\r\nlove you just as much if you were not turning into one of the loveliest\r\nwomen I've ever seen; but you are, and that's a fact to be reckoned\r\nwith.\" He watched her across the thin line of smoke he blew from his\r\nlips. \"What are you going to do with all that beauty and all that\r\ntalent, Miss Kronborg?\"\r\n\r\nShe turned away to the fire again. \"I don't know what you're talking\r\nabout,\" she muttered with an awkwardness which did not conceal her\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nOttenburg laughed softly. \"Oh, yes, you do! Nobody better! You're a\r\nclose one, but you give yourself away sometimes, like everybody else. Do\r\nyou know, I've decided that you never do a single thing without an\r\nulterior motive.\" He threw away his cigarette, took out his\r\ntobacco-pouch and began to fill his pipe. \"You ride and fence and walk\r\nand climb, but I know that all the while you're getting somewhere in\r\nyour mind. All these things are instruments; and I, too, am an\r\ninstrument.\" He looked up in time to intercept a quick, startled glance\r\nfrom Thea. \"Oh, I don't mind,\" he chuckled; \"not a bit. Every woman,\r\nevery interesting woman, has ulterior motives, many of 'em less\r\ncreditable than yours. It's your constancy that amuses me. You must have\r\nbeen doing it ever since you were two feet high.\"\r\n\r\nThea looked slowly up at her companion's good-humored face. His eyes,\r\nsometimes too restless and sympathetic in town, had grown steadier and\r\nclearer in the open air. His short curly beard and yellow hair had\r\nreddened in the sun and wind. The pleasant vigor of his person was\r\nalways delightful to her, something to signal to and laugh with in a\r\nworld of negative people. With Fred she was never becalmed. There was\r\nalways life in the air, always something coming and going, a rhythm of\r\nfeeling and action,--stronger than the natural accord of youth. As she\r\nlooked at him, leaning against the sunny wall, she felt a desire to be\r\nfrank with him. She was not willfully holding anything back. But, on the\r\nother hand, she could not force things that held themselves back. \"Yes,\r\nit was like that when I was little,\" she said at last. \"I had to be\r\nclose, as you call it, or go under. But I didn't know I had been like\r\nthat since you came. I've had nothing to be close about. I haven't\r\nthought about anything but having a good time with you. I've just\r\ndrifted.\"\r\n\r\nFred blew a trail of smoke out into the breeze and looked knowing. \"Yes,\r\nyou drift like a rifle ball, my dear. It's your--your direction that I\r\nlike best of all. Most fellows wouldn't, you know. I'm unusual.\"\r\n\r\nThey both laughed, but Thea frowned questioningly. \"Why wouldn't most\r\nfellows? Other fellows have liked me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, serious fellows. You told me yourself they were all old, or\r\nsolemn. But jolly fellows want to be the whole target. They would say\r\nyou were all brain and muscle; that you have no feeling.\"\r\n\r\nShe glanced at him sidewise. \"Oh, they would, would they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course they would,\" Fred continued blandly. \"Jolly fellows have no\r\nimagination. They want to be the animating force. When they are not\r\naround, they want a girl to be--extinct,\" he waved his hand. \"Old\r\nfellows like Mr. Nathanmeyer understand your kind; but among the young\r\nones, you are rather lucky to have found me. Even I wasn't always so\r\nwise. I've had my time of thinking it would not bore me to be the Apollo\r\nof a homey flat, and I've paid out a trifle to learn better. All those\r\nthings get very tedious unless they are hooked up with an idea of some\r\nsort. It's because we DON'T come out here only to look at each other and\r\ndrink coffee that it's so pleasant to--look at each other.\" Fred drew\r\non his pipe for a while, studying Thea's abstraction. She was staring up\r\nat the far wall of the canyon with a troubled expression that drew her\r\neyes narrow and her mouth hard. Her hands lay in her lap, one over the\r\nother, the fingers interlacing. \"Suppose,\" Fred came out at\r\nlength,--\"suppose I were to offer you what most of the young men I know\r\nwould offer a girl they'd been sitting up nights about: a comfortable\r\nflat in Chicago, a summer camp up in the woods, musical evenings, and a\r\nfamily to bring up. Would it look attractive to you?\"\r\n\r\nThea sat up straight and stared at him in alarm, glared into his eyes.\r\n\"Perfectly hideous!\" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nFred dropped back against the old stonework and laughed deep in his\r\nchest. \"Well, don't be frightened. I won't offer them. You're not a\r\nnest-building bird. You know I always liked your song, 'Me for the jolt\r\nof the breakers!' I understand.\"\r\n\r\nShe rose impatiently and walked to the edge of the cliff. \"It's not that\r\nso much. It's waking up every morning with the feeling that your life is\r\nyour own, and your strength is your own, and your talent is your own;\r\nthat you're all there, and there's no sag in you.\" She stood for a\r\nmoment as if she were tortured by uncertainty, then turned suddenly back\r\nto him. \"Don't talk about these things any more now,\" she entreated. \"It\r\nisn't that I want to keep anything from you. The trouble is that I've\r\ngot nothing to keep--except (you know as well as I) that feeling. I told\r\nyou about it in Chicago once. But it always makes me unhappy to talk\r\nabout it. It will spoil the day. Will you go for a climb with me?\" She\r\nheld out her hands with a smile so eager that it made Ottenburg feel how\r\nmuch she needed to get away from herself.\r\n\r\nHe sprang up and caught the hands she put out so cordially, and stood\r\nswinging them back and forth. \"I won't tease you. A word's enough to me.\r\nBut I love it, all the same. Understand?\" He pressed her hands and\r\ndropped them. \"Now, where are you going to drag me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want you to drag me. Over there, to the other houses. They are more\r\ninteresting than these.\" She pointed across the gorge to the row of\r\nwhite houses in the other cliff. \"The trail is broken away, but I got up\r\nthere once. It's possible. You have to go to the bottom of the canyon,\r\ncross the creek, and then go up hand-over-hand.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg, lounging against the sunny wall, his hands in the pockets of\r\nhis jacket, looked across at the distant dwellings. \"It's an awful\r\nclimb,\" he sighed, \"when I could be perfectly happy here with my pipe.\r\nHowever--\" He took up his stick and hat and followed Thea down the water\r\ntrail. \"Do you climb this path every day? You surely earn your bath. I\r\nwent down and had a look at your pool the other afternoon. Neat place,\r\nwith all those little cottonwoods. Must be very becoming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Think so?\" Thea said over her shoulder, as she swung round a turn.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and so do you, evidently. I'm becoming expert at reading your\r\nmeaning in your back. I'm behind you so much on these single-foot\r\ntrails. You don't wear stays, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't, anywhere, if I were you. They will make you less elastic.\r\nThe side muscles get flabby. If you go in for opera, there's a fortune\r\nin a flexible body. Most of the German singers are clumsy, even when\r\nthey're well set up.\"\r\n\r\nThea switched a PINON branch back at him. \"Oh, I'll never get fat! That\r\nI can promise you.\"\r\n\r\nFred smiled, looking after her. \"Keep that promise, no matter how many\r\nothers you break,\" he drawled.\r\n\r\nThe upward climb, after they had crossed the stream, was at first a\r\nbreathless scramble through underbrush. When they reached the big\r\nboulders, Ottenburg went first because he had the longer leg-reach, and\r\ngave Thea a hand when the step was quite beyond her, swinging her up\r\nuntil she could get a foothold. At last they reached a little platform\r\namong the rocks, with only a hundred feet of jagged, sloping wall\r\nbetween them and the cliff-houses.\r\n\r\nOttenburg lay down under a pine tree and declared that he was going to\r\nhave a pipe before he went any farther. \"It's a good thing to know when\r\nto stop, Thea,\" he said meaningly.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to stop now until I get there,\" Thea insisted. \"I'll go\r\non alone.\"\r\n\r\nFred settled his shoulder against the tree-trunk. \"Go on if you like,\r\nbut I'm here to enjoy myself. If you meet a rattler on the way, have it\r\nout with him.\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, fanning herself with her felt hat. \"I never have met\r\none.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's reasoning for you,\" Fred murmured languidly.\r\n\r\nThea turned away resolutely and began to go up the wall, using an\r\nirregular cleft in the rock for a path. The cliff, which looked almost\r\nperpendicular from the bottom, was really made up of ledges and\r\nboulders, and behind these she soon disappeared. For a long while Fred\r\nsmoked with half-closed eyes, smiling to himself now and again.\r\nOccasionally he lifted an eyebrow as he heard the rattle of small stones\r\namong the rocks above. \"In a temper,\" he concluded; \"do her good.\" Then\r\nhe subsided into warm drowsiness and listened to the locusts in the\r\nyuccas, and the tap-tap of the old woodpecker that was never weary of\r\nassaulting the big pine.\r\n\r\nFred had finished his pipe and was wondering whether he wanted another,\r\nwhen he heard a call from the cliff far above him. Looking up, he saw\r\nThea standing on the edge of a projecting crag. She waved to him and\r\nthrew her arm over her head, as if she were snapping her fingers in the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nAs he saw her there between the sky and the gulf, with that great wash\r\nof air and the morning light about her, Fred recalled the brilliant\r\nfigure at Mrs. Nathanmeyer's. Thea was one of those people who emerge,\r\nunexpectedly, larger than we are accustomed to see them. Even at this\r\ndistance one got the impression of muscular energy and audacity,--a kind\r\nof brilliancy of motion,--of a personality that carried across big\r\nspaces and expanded among big things. Lying still, with his hands under\r\nhis head, Ottenburg rhetorically addressed the figure in the air. \"You\r\nare the sort that used to run wild in Germany, dressed in their hair and\r\na piece of skin. Soldiers caught 'em in nets. Old Nathanmeyer,\" he\r\nmused, \"would like a peep at her now. Knowing old fellow. Always buying\r\nthose Zorn etchings of peasant girls bathing. No sag in them either.\r\nMust be the cold climate.\" He sat up. \"She'll begin to pitch rocks on me\r\nif I don't move.\" In response to another impatient gesture from the\r\ncrag, he rose and began swinging slowly up the trail.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the afternoon of that long day. Thea was lying on a blanket in\r\nthe door of her rock house. She and Ottenburg had come back from their\r\nclimb and had lunch, and he had gone off for a nap in one of the\r\ncliff-houses farther down the path. He was sleeping peacefully, his coat\r\nunder his head and his face turned toward the wall.\r\n\r\nThea, too, was drowsy, and lay looking through halfclosed eyes up at the\r\nblazing blue arch over the rim of the canyon. She was thinking of\r\nnothing at all. Her mind, like her body, was full of warmth, lassitude,\r\nphysical content. Suddenly an eagle, tawny and of great size, sailed\r\nover the cleft in which she lay, across the arch of sky. He dropped for\r\na moment into the gulf between the walls, then wheeled, and mounted\r\nuntil his plumage was so steeped in light that he looked like a golden\r\nbird. He swept on, following the course of the canyon a little way and\r\nthen disappearing beyond the rim. Thea sprang to her feet as if she had\r\nbeen thrown up from the rock by volcanic action. She stood rigid on the\r\nedge of the stone shelf, straining her eyes after that strong, tawny\r\nflight. O eagle of eagles! Endeavor, achievement, desire, glorious\r\nstriving of human art! From a cleft in the heart of the world she\r\nsaluted it...It had come all the way; when men lived in caves, it was\r\nthere. A vanished race; but along the trails, in the stream, under the\r\nspreading cactus, there still glittered in the sun the bits of their\r\nfrail clay vessels, fragments of their desire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nFROM the day of Fred's arrival, he and Thea were unceasingly active.\r\nThey took long rides into the Navajo pine forests, bought turquoises and\r\nsilver bracelets from the wandering Indian herdsmen, and rode twenty\r\nmiles to Flagstaff upon the slightest pretext. Thea had never felt this\r\npleasant excitement about any man before, and she found herself trying\r\nvery hard to please young Ottenburg. She was never tired, never dull.\r\nThere was a zest about waking up in the morning and dressing, about\r\nwalking, riding, even about sleep.\r\n\r\nOne morning when Thea came out from her room at seven o'clock, she found\r\nHenry and Fred on the porch, looking up at the sky. The day was already\r\nhot and there was no breeze. The sun was shining, but heavy brown clouds\r\nwere hanging in the west, like the smoke of a forest fire. She and Fred\r\nhad meant to ride to Flagstaff that morning, but Biltmer advised against\r\nit, foretelling a storm. After breakfast they lingered about the house,\r\nwaiting for the weather to make up its mind. Fred had brought his\r\nguitar, and as they had the dining-room to themselves, he made Thea go\r\nover some songs with him. They got interested and kept it up until Mrs.\r\nBiltmer came to set the table for dinner. Ottenburg knew some of the\r\nMexican things Spanish Johnny used to sing. Thea had never before\r\nhappened to tell him about Spanish Johnny, and he seemed more interested\r\nin Johnny than in Dr. Archie or Wunsch.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner they were too restless to endure the ranch house any\r\nlonger, and ran away to the canyon to practice with single-sticks. Fred\r\ncarried a slicker and a sweater, and he made Thea wear one of the rubber\r\nhats that hung in Biltmer's gun-room. As they crossed the pasture land\r\nthe clumsy slicker kept catching in the lacings of his leggings.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you drop that thing?\" Thea asked. \"I won't mind a shower.\r\nI've been wet before.\"\r\n\r\n\"No use taking chances.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the canyon they were unable to watch the sky, since only a strip of\r\nthe zenith was visible. The flat ledge about the watch-tower was the\r\nonly level spot large enough for single-stick exercise, and they were\r\nstill practicing there when, at about four o'clock, a tremendous roll of\r\nthunder echoed between the cliffs and the atmosphere suddenly became\r\nthick.\r\n\r\nFred thrust the sticks in a cleft in the rock. \"We're in for it, Thea.\r\nBetter make for your cave where there are blankets.\" He caught her elbow\r\nand hurried her along the path before the cliff-houses. They made the\r\nhalf-mile at a quick trot, and as they ran the rocks and the sky and the\r\nair between the cliffs turned a turbid green, like the color in a moss\r\nagate. When they reached the blanketed rock room, they looked at each\r\nother and laughed. Their faces had taken on a greenish pallor. Thea's\r\nhair, even, was green.\r\n\r\n\"Dark as pitch in here,\" Fred exclaimed as they hurried over the old\r\nrock doorstep. \"But it's warm. The rocks hold the heat. It's going to be\r\nterribly cold outside, all right.\" He was interrupted by a deafening\r\npeal of thunder. \"Lord, what an echo! Lucky you don't mind. It's worth\r\nwatching out there. We needn't come in yet.\"\r\n\r\nThe green light grew murkier and murkier. The smaller vegetation was\r\nblotted out. The yuccas, the cedars, and PINONS stood dark and rigid,\r\nlike bronze. The swallows flew up with sharp, terrified twitterings.\r\nEven the quaking asps were still. While Fred and Thea watched from the\r\ndoorway, the light changed to purple. Clouds of dark vapor, like\r\nchlorine gas, began to float down from the head of the canyon and hung\r\nbetween them and the cliff-houses in the opposite wall. Before they knew\r\nit, the wall itself had disappeared. The air was positively\r\nvenomous-looking, and grew colder every minute. The thunder seemed to\r\ncrash against one cliff, then against the other, and to go shrieking off\r\ninto the inner canyon.\r\n\r\nThe moment the rain broke, it beat the vapors down. In the gulf before\r\nthem the water fell in spouts, and dashed from the high cliffs overhead.\r\nIt tore aspens and chokecherry bushes out of the ground and left the\r\nyuccas hanging by their tough roots. Only the little cedars stood black\r\nand unmoved in the torrents that fell from so far above. The rock\r\nchamber was full of fine spray from the streams of water that shot over\r\nthe doorway. Thea crept to the back wall and rolled herself in a\r\nblanket, and Fred threw the heavier blankets over her. The wool of the\r\nNavajo sheep was soon kindled by the warmth of her body, and was\r\nimpenetrable to dampness. Her hair, where it hung below the rubber hat,\r\ngathered the moisture like a sponge. Fred put on the slicker, tied the\r\nsweater about his neck, and settled himself cross-legged beside her. The\r\nchamber was so dark that, although he could see the outline of her head\r\nand shoulders, he could not see her face. He struck a wax match to light\r\nhis pipe. As he sheltered it between his hands, it sizzled and\r\nsputtered, throwing a yellow flicker over Thea and her blankets.\r\n\r\n\"You look like a gypsy,\" he said as he dropped the match. \"Any one you'd\r\nrather be shut up with than me? No? Sure about that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I am. Aren't you cold?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not especially.\" Fred smoked in silence, listening to the roar of the\r\nwater outside. \"We may not get away from here right away,\" he remarked.\r\n\r\n\"I shan't mind. Shall you?\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed grimly and pulled on his pipe. \"Do you know where you're at,\r\nMiss Thea Kronborg?\" he said at last. \"You've got me going pretty hard,\r\nI suppose you know. I've had a lot of sweethearts, but I've never been\r\nso much--engrossed before. What are you going to do about it?\" He heard\r\nnothing from the blankets. \"Are you going to play fair, or is it about\r\nmy cue to cut away?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll play fair. I don't see why you want to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want me around for?--to play with?\"\r\n\r\nThea struggled up among the blankets. \"I want you for everything. I\r\ndon't know whether I'm what people call in love with you or not. In\r\nMoonstone that meant sitting in a hammock with somebody. I don't want to\r\nsit in a hammock with you, but I want to do almost everything else. Oh,\r\nhundreds of things!\"\r\n\r\n\"If I run away, will you go with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I'll have to think about that. Maybe I would.\" She freed\r\nherself from her wrappings and stood up. \"It's not raining so hard now.\r\nHadn't we better start this minute? It will be night before we get to\r\nBiltmer's.\"\r\n\r\nFred struck another match. \"It's seven. I don't know how much of the\r\npath may be washed away. I don't even know whether I ought to let you\r\ntry it without a lantern.\"\r\n\r\nThea went to the doorway and looked out. \"There's nothing else to do.\r\nThe sweater and the slicker will keep me dry, and this will be my chance\r\nto find out whether these shoes are really water-tight. They cost a\r\nweek's salary.\" She retreated to the back of the cave. \"It's getting\r\nblacker every minute.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg took a brandy flask from his coat pocket. \"Better have some of\r\nthis before we start. Can you take it without water?\"\r\n\r\nThea lifted it obediently to her lips. She put on the sweater and Fred\r\nhelped her to get the clumsy slicker on over it. He buttoned it and\r\nfastened the high collar. She could feel that his hands were hurried and\r\nclumsy. The coat was too big, and he took off his necktie and belted it\r\nin at the waist. While she tucked her hair more securely under the\r\nrubber hat he stood in front of her, between her and the gray doorway,\r\nwithout moving.\r\n\r\n\"Are you ready to go?\" she asked carelessly.\r\n\r\n\"If you are,\" he spoke quietly, without moving, except to bend his head\r\nforward a little.\r\n\r\nThea laughed and put her hands on his shoulders. \"You know how to handle\r\nme, don't you?\" she whispered. For the first time, she kissed him\r\nwithout constraint or embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\"Thea, Thea, Thea!\" Fred whispered her name three times, shaking her a\r\nlittle as if to waken her. It was too dark to see, but he could feel\r\nthat she was smiling.\r\n\r\nWhen she kissed him she had not hidden her face on his shoulder,--she\r\nhad risen a little on her toes, and stood straight and free. In that\r\nmoment when he came close to her actual personality, he felt in her the\r\nsame expansion that he had noticed at Mrs. Nathanmeyer's. She became\r\nfreer and stronger under impulses. When she rose to meet him like that,\r\nhe felt her flash into everything that she had ever suggested to him, as\r\nif she filled out her own shadow.\r\n\r\nShe pushed him away and shot past him out into the rain. \"Now for it,\r\nFred,\" she called back exultantly. The rain was pouring steadily down\r\nthrough the dying gray twilight, and muddy streams were spouting and\r\nfoaming over the cliff.\r\n\r\nFred caught her and held her back. \"Keep behind me, Thea. I don't know\r\nabout the path. It may be gone altogether. Can't tell what there is\r\nunder this water.\"\r\n\r\nBut the path was older than the white man's Arizona. The rush of water\r\nhad washed away the dust and stones that lay on the surface, but the\r\nrock skeleton of the Indian trail was there, ready for the foot. Where\r\nthe streams poured down through gullies, there was always a cedar or a\r\nPINON to cling to. By wading and slipping and climbing, they got along.\r\nAs they neared the head of the canyon, where the path lifted and rose in\r\nsteep loops to the surface of the plateau, the climb was more difficult.\r\nThe earth above had broken away and washed down over the trail, bringing\r\nrocks and bushes and even young trees with it. The last ghost of\r\ndaylight was dying and there was no time to lose. The canyon behind them\r\nwas already black.\r\n\r\n\"We've got to go right through the top of this pine tree, Thea. No time\r\nto hunt a way around. Give me your hand.\" After they had crashed through\r\nthe mass of branches, Fred stopped abruptly. \"Gosh, what a hole! Can you\r\njump it? Wait a minute.\"\r\n\r\nHe cleared the washout, slipped on the wet rock at the farther side, and\r\ncaught himself just in time to escape a tumble. \"If I could only find\r\nsomething to hold to, I could give you a hand. It's so cursed dark, and\r\nthere are no trees here where they're needed. Here's something; it's a\r\nroot. It will hold all right.\" He braced himself on the rock, gripped\r\nthe crooked root with one hand and swung himself across toward Thea,\r\nholding out his arm. \"Good jump! I must say you don't lose your nerve in\r\na tight place. Can you keep at it a little longer? We're almost out.\r\nHave to make that next ledge. Put your foot on my knee and catch\r\nsomething to pull by.\"\r\n\r\nThea went up over his shoulder. \"It's hard ground up here,\" she panted.\r\n\"Did I wrench your arm when I slipped then? It was a cactus I grabbed,\r\nand it startled me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, one more pull and we're on the level.\"\r\n\r\nThey emerged gasping upon the black plateau. In the last five minutes\r\nthe darkness had solidified and it seemed as if the skies were pouring\r\nblack water. They could not see where the sky ended or the plain began.\r\nThe light at the ranch house burned a steady spark through the rain.\r\nFred drew Thea's arm through his and they struck off toward the light.\r\nThey could not see each other, and the rain at their backs seemed to\r\ndrive them along. They kept laughing as they stumbled over tufts of\r\ngrass or stepped into slippery pools. They were delighted with each\r\nother and with the adventure which lay behind them.\r\n\r\n\"I can't even see the whites of your eyes, Thea. But I'd know who was\r\nhere stepping out with me, anywhere. Part coyote you are, by the feel of\r\nyou. When you make up your mind to jump, you jump! My gracious, what's\r\nthe matter with your hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cactus spines. Didn't I tell you when I grabbed the cactus? I thought\r\nit was a root. Are we going straight?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. Somewhere near it, I think. I'm very comfortable, aren't\r\nyou? You're warm, except your cheeks. How funny they are when they're\r\nwet. Still, you always feel like you. I like this. I could walk to\r\nFlagstaff. It's fun, not being able to see anything. I feel surer of you\r\nwhen I can't see you. Will you run away with me?\"\r\n\r\nThea laughed. \"I won't run far to-night. I'll think about it. Look,\r\nFred, there's somebody coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Henry, with his lantern. Good enough! Halloo! Hallo--o--o!\" Fred\r\nshouted.\r\n\r\nThe moving light bobbed toward them. In half an hour Thea was in her big\r\nfeather bed, drinking hot lentil soup, and almost before the soup was\r\nswallowed she was asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nON the first day of September Fred Ottenburg and Thea Kronborg left\r\nFlagstaff by the east-bound express. As the bright morning advanced,\r\nthey sat alone on the rear platform of the observation car, watching the\r\nyellow miles unfold and disappear. With complete content they saw the\r\nbrilliant, empty country flash by. They were tired of the desert and the\r\ndead races, of a world without change or ideas. Fred said he was glad to\r\nsit back and let the Santa Fe do the work for a while.\r\n\r\n\"And where are we going, anyhow?\" he added.\r\n\r\n\"To Chicago, I suppose. Where else would we be going?\" Thea hunted for a\r\nhandkerchief in her handbag.\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't sure, so I had the trunks checked to Albuquerque. We can\r\nrecheck there to Chicago, if you like. Why Chicago? You'll never go back\r\nto Bowers. Why wouldn't this be a good time to make a run for it? We\r\ncould take the southern branch at Albuquerque, down to El Paso, and then\r\nover into Mexico. We are exceptionally free. Nobody waiting for us\r\nanywhere.\"\r\n\r\nThea sighted along the steel rails that quivered in the light behind\r\nthem. \"I don't see why I couldn't marry you in Chicago, as well as any\r\nplace,\" she brought out with some embarrassment.\r\n\r\nFred took the handbag out of her nervous clasp and swung it about on his\r\nfinger. \"You've no particular love for that spot, have you? Besides, as\r\nI've told you, my family would make a row. They are an excitable lot.\r\nThey discuss and argue everlastingly. The only way I can ever put\r\nanything through is to go ahead, and convince them afterward.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I understand. I don't mind that. I don't want to marry your\r\nfamily. I'm sure you wouldn't want to marry mine. But I don't see why we\r\nhave to go so far.\"\r\n\r\n\"When we get to Winslow, you look about the freight yards and you'll\r\nprobably see several yellow cars with my name on them. That's why, my\r\ndear. When your visiting-card is on every beer bottle, you can't do\r\nthings quietly. Things get into the papers.\" As he watched her troubled\r\nexpression, he grew anxious. He leaned forward on his camp-chair, and\r\nkept twirling the handbag between his knees. \"Here's a suggestion,\r\nThea,\" he said presently. \"Dismiss it if you don't like it: suppose we\r\ngo down to Mexico on the chance. You've never seen anything like Mexico\r\nCity; it will be a lark for you, anyhow. If you change your mind, and\r\ndon't want to marry me, you can go back to Chicago, and I'll take a\r\nsteamer from Vera Cruz and go up to New York. When I get to Chicago,\r\nyou'll be at work, and nobody will ever be the wiser. No reason why we\r\nshouldn't both travel in Mexico, is there? You'll be traveling alone.\r\nI'll merely tell you the right places to stop, and come to take you\r\ndriving. I won't put any pressure on you. Have I ever?\" He swung the bag\r\ntoward her and looked up under her hat.\r\n\r\n\"No, you haven't,\" she murmured. She was thinking that her own position\r\nmight be less difficult if he had used what he called pressure. He\r\nclearly wished her to take the responsibility.\r\n\r\n\"You have your own future in the back of your mind all the time,\" Fred\r\nbegan, \"and I have it in mine. I'm not going to try to carry you off, as\r\nI might another girl. If you wanted to quit me, I couldn't hold you, no\r\nmatter how many times you had married me. I don't want to overpersuade\r\nyou. But I'd like mighty well to get you down to that jolly old city,\r\nwhere everything would please you, and give myself a chance. Then, if\r\nyou thought you could have a better time with me than without me, I'd\r\ntry to grab you before you changed your mind. You are not a sentimental\r\nperson.\"\r\n\r\nThea drew her veil down over her face. \"I think I am, a little; about\r\nyou,\" she said quietly. Fred's irony somehow hurt her.\r\n\r\n\"What's at the bottom of your mind, Thea?\" he asked hurriedly. \"I can't\r\ntell. Why do you consider it at all, if you're not sure? Why are you\r\nhere with me now?\"\r\n\r\nHer face was half-averted. He was thinking that it looked older and more\r\nfirm--almost hard--under a veil.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it possible to do things without having any very clear reason?\"\r\nshe asked slowly. \"I have no plan in the back of my mind. Now that I'm\r\nwith you, I want to be with you; that's all. I can't settle down to\r\nbeing alone again. I am here to-day because I want to be with you\r\nto-day.\" She paused. \"One thing, though; if I gave you my word, I'd keep\r\nit. And you could hold me, though you don't seem to think so. Maybe I'm\r\nnot sentimental, but I'm not very light, either. If I went off with you\r\nlike this, it wouldn't be to amuse myself.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg's eyes fell. His lips worked nervously for a moment. \"Do you\r\nmean that you really care for me, Thea Kronborg?\" he asked unsteadily.\r\n\r\n\"I guess so. It's like anything else. It takes hold of you and you've\r\ngot to go through with it, even if you're afraid. I was afraid to leave\r\nMoonstone, and afraid to leave Harsanyi. But I had to go through with\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"And are you afraid now?\" Fred asked slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; more than I've ever been. But I don't think I could go back. The\r\npast closes up behind one, somehow. One would rather have a new kind of\r\nmisery. The old kind seems like death or unconsciousness. You can't\r\nforce your life back into that mould again. No, one can't go back.\" She\r\nrose and stood by the back grating of the platform, her hand on the\r\nbrass rail.\r\n\r\nFred went to her side. She pushed up her veil and turned her most\r\nglowing face to him. Her eyes were wet and there were tears on her\r\nlashes, but she was smiling the rare, whole-hearted smile he had seen\r\nonce or twice before. He looked at her shining eyes, her parted lips,\r\nher chin a little lifted. It was as if they were colored by a sunrise he\r\ncould not see. He put his hand over hers and clasped it with a strength\r\nshe felt. Her eyelashes trembled, her mouth softened, but her eyes were\r\nstill brilliant.\r\n\r\n\"Will you always be like you were down there, if I go with you?\" she\r\nasked under her breath.\r\n\r\nHis fingers tightened on hers. \"By God, I will!\" he muttered.\r\n\r\n\"That's the only promise I'll ask you for. Now go away for a while and\r\nlet me think about it. Come back at lunchtime and I'll tell you. Will\r\nthat do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything will do, Thea, if you'll only let me keep an eye on you. The\r\nrest of the world doesn't interest me much. You've got me in deep.\"\r\n\r\nFred dropped her hand and turned away. As he glanced back from the front\r\nend of the observation car, he saw that she was still standing there,\r\nand any one would have known that she was brooding over something. The\r\nearnestness of her head and shoulders had a certain nobility. He stood\r\nlooking at her for a moment.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the forward smoking-car, Fred took a seat at the end,\r\nwhere he could shut the other passengers from his sight. He put on his\r\ntraveling-cap and sat down wearily, keeping his head near the window.\r\n\"In any case, I shall help her more than I shall hurt her,\" he kept\r\nsaying to himself. He admitted that this was not the only motive which\r\nimpelled him, but it was one of them. \"I'll make it my business in life\r\nto get her on. There's nothing else I care about so much as seeing her\r\nhave her chance. She hasn't touched her real force yet. She isn't even\r\naware of it. Lord, don't I know something about them? There isn't one of\r\nthem that has such a depth to draw from. She'll be one of the great\r\nartists of our time. Playing accompaniments for that cheese-faced sneak!\r\nI'll get her off to Germany this winter, or take her. She hasn't got any\r\ntime to waste now. I'll make it up to her, all right.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg certainly meant to make it up to her, in so far as he could.\r\nHis feeling was as generous as strong human feelings are likely to be.\r\nThe only trouble was, that he was married already, and had been since he\r\nwas twenty.\r\n\r\nHis older friends in Chicago, people who had been friends of his family,\r\nknew of the unfortunate state of his personal affairs; but they were\r\npeople whom in the natural course of things Thea Kronborg would scarcely\r\nmeet. Mrs. Frederick Ottenburg lived in California, at Santa Barbara,\r\nwhere her health was supposed to be better than elsewhere, and her\r\nhusband lived in Chicago. He visited his wife every winter to reinforce\r\nher position, and his devoted mother, although her hatred for her\r\ndaughter-inlaw was scarcely approachable in words, went to Santa Barbara\r\nevery year to make things look better and to relieve her son.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Frederick Ottenburg was beginning his junior year at Harvard, he\r\ngot a letter from Dick Brisbane, a Kansas City boy he knew, telling him\r\nthat his FIANCEE, Miss Edith Beers, was going to New York to buy her\r\ntrousseau. She would be at the Holland House, with her aunt and a girl\r\nfrom Kansas City who was to be a bridesmaid, for two weeks or more. If\r\nOttenburg happened to be going down to New York, would he call upon Miss\r\nBeers and \"show her a good time\"?\r\n\r\nFred did happen to be going to New York. He was going down from New\r\nHaven, after the Thanksgiving game. He called on Miss Beers and found\r\nher, as he that night telegraphed Brisbane, a \"ripping beauty, no\r\nmistake.\" He took her and her aunt and her uninteresting friend to the\r\ntheater and to the opera, and he asked them to lunch with him at the\r\nWaldorf. He took no little pains in arranging the luncheon with the head\r\nwaiter. Miss Beers was the sort of girl with whom a young man liked to\r\nseem experienced. She was dark and slender and fiery. She was witty and\r\nslangy; said daring things and carried them off with NONCHALANCE. Her\r\nchildish extravagance and contempt for all the serious facts of life\r\ncould be charged to her father's generosity and his long packing-house\r\npurse. Freaks that would have been vulgar and ostentatious in a more\r\nsimpleminded girl, in Miss Beers seemed whimsical and picturesque. She\r\ndarted about in magnificent furs and pumps and close-clinging gowns,\r\nthough that was the day of full skirts. Her hats were large and floppy.\r\nWhen she wriggled out of her moleskin coat at luncheon, she looked like\r\na slim black weasel. Her satin dress was a mere sheath, so conspicuous\r\nby its severity and scantness that every one in the dining-room stared.\r\nShe ate nothing but alligator-pear salad and hothouse grapes, drank a\r\nlittle champagne, and took cognac in her coffee. She ridiculed, in the\r\nraciest slang, the singers they had heard at the opera the night before,\r\nand when her aunt pretended to reprove her, she murmured indifferently,\r\n\"What's the matter with you, old sport?\" She rattled on with a subdued\r\nloquaciousness, always keeping her voice low and monotonous, always\r\nlooking out of the corner of her eye and speaking, as it were, in\r\nasides, out of the corner of her mouth. She was scornful of\r\neverything,--which became her eyebrows. Her face was mobile and\r\ndiscontented, her eyes quick and black. There was a sort of smouldering\r\nfire about her, young Ottenburg thought. She entertained him\r\nprodigiously.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon Miss Beers said she was going uptown to be fitted, and\r\nthat she would go alone because her aunt made her nervous. When Fred\r\nheld her coat for her, she murmured, \"Thank you, Alphonse,\" as if she\r\nwere addressing the waiter. As she stepped into a hansom, with a long\r\nstretch of thin silk stocking, she said negligently, over her fur\r\ncollar, \"Better let me take you along and drop you somewhere.\" He sprang\r\nin after her, and she told the driver to go to the Park.\r\n\r\nIt was a bright winter day, and bitterly cold. Miss Beers asked Fred to\r\ntell her about the game at New Haven, and when he did so paid no\r\nattention to what he said. She sank back into the hansom and held her\r\nmuff before her face, lowering it occasionally to utter laconic remarks\r\nabout the people in the carriages they passed, interrupting Fred's\r\nnarrative in a disconcerting manner. As they entered the Park he\r\nhappened to glance under her wide black hat at her black eyes and\r\nhair--the muff hid everything else--and discovered that she was crying.\r\nTo his solicitous inquiry she replied that it \"was enough to make you\r\ndamp, to go and try on dresses to marry a man you weren't keen about.\"\r\n\r\nFurther explanations followed. She had thought she was \"perfectly\r\ncracked\" about Brisbane, until she met Fred at the Holland House three\r\ndays ago. Then she knew she would scratch Brisbane's eyes out if she\r\nmarried him. What was she going to do?\r\n\r\nFred told the driver to keep going. What did she want to do? Well, she\r\ndidn't know. One had to marry somebody, after all the machinery had been\r\nput in motion. Perhaps she might as well scratch Brisbane as anybody\r\nelse; for scratch she would, if she didn't get what she wanted.\r\n\r\nOf course, Fred agreed, one had to marry somebody. And certainly this\r\ngirl beat anything he had ever been up against before. Again he told the\r\ndriver to go ahead. Did she mean that she would think of marrying him,\r\nby any chance? Of course she did, Alphonse. Hadn't he seen that all over\r\nher face three days ago? If he hadn't, he was a snowball.\r\n\r\nBy this time Fred was beginning to feel sorry for the driver. Miss\r\nBeers, however, was compassionless. After a few more turns, Fred\r\nsuggested tea at the Casino. He was very cold himself, and remembering\r\nthe shining silk hose and pumps, he wondered that the girl was not\r\nfrozen. As they got out of the hansom, he slipped the driver a bill and\r\ntold him to have something hot while he waited.\r\n\r\nAt the tea-table, in a snug glass enclosure, with the steam sputtering\r\nin the pipes beside them and a brilliant winter sunset without, they\r\ndeveloped their plan. Miss Beers had with her plenty of money, destined\r\nfor tradesmen, which she was quite willing to divert into other\r\nchannels--the first excitement of buying a trousseau had worn off,\r\nanyway. It was very much like any other shopping. Fred had his allowance\r\nand a few hundred he had won on the game. She would meet him to-morrow\r\nmorning at the Jersey ferry. They could take one of the west-bound\r\nPennsylvania trains and go--anywhere, some place where the laws weren't\r\ntoo fussy.--Fred had not even thought about the laws!--It would be all\r\nright with her father; he knew Fred's family.\r\n\r\nNow that they were engaged, she thought she would like to drive a little\r\nmore. They were jerked about in the cab for another hour through the\r\ndeserted Park. Miss Beers, having removed her hat, reclined upon Fred's\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nThe next morning they left Jersey City by the latest fast train out.\r\nThey had some misadventures, crossed several States before they found a\r\njustice obliging enough to marry two persons whose names automatically\r\ninstigated inquiry. The bride's family were rather pleased with her\r\noriginality; besides, any one of the Ottenburg boys was clearly a better\r\nmatch than young Brisbane. With Otto Ottenburg, however, the affair went\r\ndown hard, and to his wife, the once proud Katarina Furst, such a\r\ndisappointment was almost unbearable. Her sons had always been clay in\r\nher hands, and now the GELIEBTER SOHN had escaped her.\r\n\r\nBeers, the packer, gave his daughter a house in St. Louis, and Fred went\r\ninto his father's business. At the end of a year, he was mutely\r\nappealing to his mother for sympathy. At the end of two, he was drinking\r\nand in open rebellion. He had learned to detest his wife. Her\r\nwastefulness and cruelty revolted him. The ignorance and the fatuous\r\nconceit which lay behind her grimacing mask of slang and ridicule\r\nhumiliated him so deeply that he became absolutely reckless. Her grace\r\nwas only an uneasy wriggle, her audacity was the result of insolence and\r\nenvy, and her wit was restless spite. As her personal mannerisms grew\r\nmore and more odious to him, he began to dull his perceptions with\r\nchampagne. He had it for tea, he drank it with dinner, and during the\r\nevening he took enough to insure that he would be well insulated when he\r\ngot home. This behavior spread alarm among his friends. It was\r\nscandalous, and it did not occur among brewers. He was violating the\r\nNOBLESSE OBLIGE of his guild. His father and his father's partners\r\nlooked alarmed.\r\n\r\nWhen Fred's mother went to him and with clasped hands entreated an\r\nexplanation, he told her that the only trouble was that he couldn't hold\r\nenough wine to make life endurable, so he was going to get out from\r\nunder and enlist in the navy. He didn't want anything but the shirt on\r\nhis back and clean salt air. His mother could look out; he was going to\r\nmake a scandal.\r\n\r\nMrs. Otto Ottenburg went to Kansas City to see Mr. Beers, and had the\r\nsatisfaction of telling him that he had brought up his daughter like a\r\nsavage, EINE UNGEBILDETE. All the Ottenburgs and all the Beers, and many\r\nof their friends, were drawn into the quarrel. It was to public opinion,\r\nhowever and not to his mother's activities, that Fred owed his partial\r\nescape from bondage. The cosmopolitan brewing world of St. Louis had\r\nconservative standards. The Ottenburgs' friends were not predisposed in\r\nfavor of the plunging Kansas City set, and they disliked young Fred's\r\nwife from the day that she was brought among them. They found her\r\nignorant and ill-bred and insufferably impertinent. When they became\r\naware of how matters were going between her and Fred, they omitted no\r\nopportunity to snub her. Young Fred had always been popular, and St.\r\nLouis people took up his cause with warmth. Even the younger men, among\r\nwhom Mrs. Fred tried to draft a following, at first avoided and then\r\nignored her. Her defeat was so conspicuous, her life became such a\r\ndesert, that she at last consented to accept the house in Santa Barbara\r\nwhich Mrs. Otto Ottenburg had long owned and cherished. This villa, with\r\nits luxuriant gardens, was the price of Fred's furlough. His mother was\r\nonly too glad to offer it in his behalf. As soon as his wife was\r\nestablished in California, Fred was transferred from St. Louis to\r\nChicago.\r\n\r\nA divorce was the one thing Edith would never, never, give him. She told\r\nhim so, and she told his family so, and her father stood behind her. She\r\nwould enter into no arrangement that might eventually lead to divorce.\r\nShe had insulted her husband before guests and servants, had scratched\r\nhis face, thrown hand-mirrors and hairbrushes and nail-scissors at him\r\noften enough, but she knew that Fred was hardly the fellow who would go\r\ninto court and offer that sort of evidence. In her behavior with other\r\nmen she was discreet.\r\n\r\nAfter Fred went to Chicago, his mother visited him often, and dropped a\r\nword to her old friends there, who were already kindly disposed toward\r\nthe young man. They gossiped as little as was compatible with the\r\ninterest they felt, undertook to make life agreeable for Fred, and told\r\nhis story only where they felt it would do good: to girls who seemed to\r\nfind the young brewer attractive. So far, he had behaved well, and had\r\nkept out of entanglements.\r\n\r\nSince he was transferred to Chicago, Fred had been abroad several times,\r\nand had fallen more and more into the way of going about among young\r\nartists,--people with whom personal relations were incidental. With\r\nwomen, and even girls, who had careers to follow, a young man might have\r\npleasant friendships without being regarded as a prospective suitor or\r\nlover. Among artists his position was not irregular, because with them\r\nhis marriageableness was not an issue. His tastes, his enthusiasm, and\r\nhis agreeable personality made him welcome.\r\n\r\nWith Thea Kronborg he had allowed himself more liberty than he usually\r\ndid in his friendships or gallantries with young artists, because she\r\nseemed to him distinctly not the marrying kind. She impressed him as\r\nequipped to be an artist, and to be nothing else; already directed,\r\nconcentrated, formed as to mental habit. He was generous and\r\nsympathetic, and she was lonely and needed friendship; needed\r\ncheerfulness. She had not much power of reaching out toward useful\r\npeople or useful experiences, did not see opportunities. She had no tact\r\nabout going after good positions or enlisting the interest of\r\ninfluential persons. She antagonized people rather than conciliated\r\nthem. He discovered at once that she had a merry side, a robust humor\r\nthat was deep and hearty, like her laugh, but it slept most of the time\r\nunder her own doubts and the dullness of her life. She had not what is\r\ncalled a \"sense of humor.\" That is, she had no intellectual humor; no\r\npower to enjoy the absurdities of people, no relish of their\r\npretentiousness and inconsistencies--which only depressed her. But her\r\njoviality, Fred felt, was an asset, and ought to be developed. He\r\ndiscovered that she was more receptive and more effective under a\r\npleasant stimulus than she was under the gray grind which she considered\r\nher salvation. She was still Methodist enough to believe that if a thing\r\nwere hard and irksome, it must be good for her. And yet, whatever she\r\ndid well was spontaneous. Under the least glow of excitement, as at Mrs.\r\nNathanmeyer's, he had seen the apprehensive, frowning drudge of Bowers's\r\nstudio flash into a resourceful and consciously beautiful woman.\r\n\r\nHis interest in Thea was serious, almost from the first, and so sincere\r\nthat he felt no distrust of himself. He believed that he knew a great\r\ndeal more about her possibilities than Bowers knew, and he liked to\r\nthink that he had given her a stronger hold on life. She had never seen\r\nherself or known herself as she did at Mrs. Nathanmeyer's musical\r\nevenings. She had been a different girl ever since. He had not\r\nanticipated that she would grow more fond of him than his immediate\r\nusefulness warranted. He thought he knew the ways of artists, and, as he\r\nsaid, she must have been \"at it from her cradle.\" He had imagined,\r\nperhaps, but never really believed, that he would find her waiting for\r\nhim sometime as he found her waiting on the day he reached the Biltmer\r\nranch. Once he found her so--well, he did not pretend to be anything\r\nmore or less than a reasonably well-intentioned young man. A lovesick\r\ngirl or a flirtatious woman he could have handled easily enough. But a\r\npersonality like that, unconsciously revealing itself for the first time\r\nunder the exaltation of a personal feeling,--what could one do but watch\r\nit? As he used to say to himself, in reckless moments back there in the\r\ncanyon, \"You can't put out a sunrise.\" He had to watch it, and then he\r\nhad to share it.\r\n\r\nBesides, was he really going to do her any harm? The Lord knew he would\r\nmarry her if he could! Marriage would be an incident, not an end with\r\nher; he was sure of that. If it were not he, it would be some one else;\r\nsome one who would be a weight about her neck, probably; who would hold\r\nher back and beat her down and divert her from the first plunge for\r\nwhich he felt she was gathering all her energies. He meant to help her,\r\nand he could not think of another man who would. He went over his\r\nunmarried friends, East and West, and he could not think of one who\r\nwould know what she was driving at--or care. The clever ones were\r\nselfish, the kindly ones were stupid.\r\n\r\n\"Damn it, if she's going to fall in love with somebody, it had better be\r\nme than any of the others--of the sort she'd find. Get her tied up with\r\nsome conceited ass who'd try to make her over, train her like a puppy!\r\nGive one of 'em a big nature like that, and he'd be horrified. He\r\nwouldn't show his face in the clubs until he'd gone after her and combed\r\nher down to conform to some fool idea in his own head--put there by some\r\nother woman, too, his first sweetheart or his grandmother or a maiden\r\naunt. At least, I understand her. I know what she needs and where she's\r\nbound, and I mean to see that she has a fighting chance.\"\r\n\r\nHis own conduct looked crooked, he admitted; but he asked himself\r\nwhether, between men and women, all ways were not more or less crooked.\r\nHe believed those which are called straight were the most dangerous of\r\nall. They seemed to him, for the most part, to lie between windowless\r\nstone walls, and their rectitude had been achieved at the expense of\r\nlight and air. In their unquestioned regularity lurked every sort of\r\nhuman cruelty and meanness, and every kind of humiliation and suffering.\r\nHe would rather have any woman he cared for wounded than crushed. He\r\nwould deceive her not once, he told himself fiercely, but a hundred\r\ntimes, to keep her free.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Fred went back to the observation car at one o'clock, after the\r\nluncheon call, it was empty, and he found Thea alone on the platform.\r\nShe put out her hand, and met his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"It's as I said. Things have closed behind me. I can't go back, so I am\r\ngoing on--to Mexico?\" She lifted her face with an eager, questioning\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nFred met it with a sinking heart. Had he really hoped she would give him\r\nanother answer? He would have given pretty much anything--But there,\r\nthat did no good. He could give only what he had. Things were never\r\ncomplete in this world; you had to snatch at them as they came or go\r\nwithout. Nobody could look into her face and draw back, nobody who had\r\nany courage. She had courage enough for anything--look at her mouth and\r\nchin and eyes! Where did it come from, that light? How could a face, a\r\nfamiliar face, become so the picture of hope, be painted with the very\r\ncolors of youth's exaltation? She was right; she was not one of those\r\nwho draw back. Some people get on by avoiding dangers, others by riding\r\nthrough them.\r\n\r\nThey stood by the railing looking back at the sand levels, both feeling\r\nthat the train was steaming ahead very fast. Fred's mind was a confusion\r\nof images and ideas. Only two things were clear to him: the force of her\r\ndetermination, and the belief that, handicapped as he was, he could do\r\nbetter by her than another man would do. He knew he would always\r\nremember her, standing there with that expectant, forward-looking smile,\r\nenough to turn the future into summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V. DR. ARCHIE'S VENTURE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nDR. HOWARD ARCHIE had come down to Denver for a meeting of the\r\nstockholders in the San Felipe silver mine. It was not absolutely\r\nnecessary for him to come, but he had no very pressing cases at home.\r\nWinter was closing down in Moonstone, and he dreaded the dullness of it.\r\nOn the 10th day of January, therefore, he was registered at the Brown\r\nPalace Hotel. On the morning of the 11th he came down to breakfast to\r\nfind the streets white and the air thick with snow. A wild northwester\r\nwas blowing down from the mountains, one of those beautiful storms that\r\nwrap Denver in dry, furry snow, and make the city a loadstone to\r\nthousands of men in the mountains and on the plains. The brakemen out on\r\ntheir box-cars, the miners up in their diggings, the lonely homesteaders\r\nin the sand hills of Yucca and Kit Carson Counties, begin to think of\r\nDenver, muffled in snow, full of food and drink and good cheer, and to\r\nyearn for her with that admiration which makes her, more than other\r\nAmerican cities, an object of sentiment.\r\n\r\nHoward Archie was glad he had got in before the storm came. He felt as\r\ncheerful as if he had received a legacy that morning, and he greeted the\r\nclerk with even greater friendliness than usual when he stopped at the\r\ndesk for his mail. In the dining-room he found several old friends\r\nseated here and there before substantial breakfasts: cattlemen and\r\nmining engineers from odd corners of the State, all looking fresh and\r\nwell pleased with themselves. He had a word with one and another before\r\nhe sat down at the little table by a window, where the Austrian head\r\nwaiter stood attentively behind a chair. After his breakfast was put\r\nbefore him, the doctor began to run over his letters. There was one\r\ndirected in Thea Kronborg's handwriting, forwarded from Moonstone. He\r\nsaw with astonishment, as he put another lump of sugar into his cup,\r\nthat this letter bore a New York postmark. He had known that Thea was in\r\nMexico, traveling with some Chicago people, but New York, to a Denver\r\nman, seems much farther away than Mexico City. He put the letter behind\r\nhis plate, upright against the stem of his water goblet, and looked at\r\nit thoughtfully while he drank his second cup of coffee. He had been a\r\nlittle anxious about Thea; she had not written to him for a long while.\r\n\r\nAs he never got good coffee at home, the doctor always drank three cups\r\nfor breakfast when he was in Denver. Oscar knew just when to bring him a\r\nsecond pot, fresh and smoking. \"And more cream, Oscar, please. You know\r\nI like lots of cream,\" the doctor murmured, as he opened the square\r\nenvelope, marked in the upper right-hand corner, \"Everett House, Union\r\nSquare.\" The text of the letter was as follows:--\r\n\r\nDEAR DOCTOR ARCHIE:--\r\n\r\nI have not written to you for a long time, but it has not been\r\nunintentional. I could not write you frankly, and so I would not write\r\nat all. I can be frank with you now, but not by letter. It is a great\r\ndeal to ask, but I wonder if you could come to New York to help me out?\r\nI have got into difficulties, and I need your advice. I need your\r\nfriendship. I am afraid I must even ask you to lend me money, if you can\r\nwithout serious inconvenience. I have to go to Germany to study, and it\r\ncan't be put off any longer. My voice is ready. Needless to say, I don't\r\nwant any word of this to reach my family. They are the last people I\r\nwould turn to, though I love my mother dearly. If you can come, please\r\ntelegraph me at this hotel. Don't despair of me. I'll make it up to you\r\nyet.\r\n\r\nYour old friend,\r\n\r\nTHEA KRONBORG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis in a bold, jagged handwriting with a Gothic turn to the\r\nletters,--something between a highly sophisticated hand and a very\r\nunsophisticated one,--not in the least smooth or flowing.\r\n\r\nThe doctor bit off the end of a cigar nervously and read the letter\r\nthrough again, fumbling distractedly in his pockets for matches, while\r\nthe waiter kept trying to call his attention to the box he had just\r\nplaced before him. At last Oscar came out, as if the idea had just\r\nstruck him, \"Matches, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, thank you.\" The doctor slipped a coin into his palm and rose,\r\ncrumpling Thea's letter in his hand and thrusting the others into his\r\npocket unopened. He went back to the desk in the lobby and beckoned to\r\nthe clerk, upon whose kindness he threw himself apologetically.\r\n\r\n\"Harry, I've got to pull out unexpectedly. Call up the Burlington, will\r\nyou, and ask them to route me to New York the quickest way, and to let\r\nus know. Ask for the hour I'll get in. I have to wire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, Dr. Archie. Have it for you in a minute.\" The young man's\r\npallid, clean-scraped face was all sympathetic interest as he reached\r\nfor the telephone. Dr. Archie put out his hand and stopped him.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute. Tell me, first, is Captain Harris down yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. The Captain hasn't come down yet this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll wait here for him. If I don't happen to catch him, nail him and\r\nget me. Thank you, Harry.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor spoke gratefully and turned away. He began to pace the lobby,\r\nhis hands behind him, watching the bronze elevator doors like a hawk. At\r\nlast Captain Harris issued from one of them, tall and imposing, wearing\r\na Stetson and fierce mustaches, a fur coat on his arm, a solitaire\r\nglittering upon his little finger and another in his black satin ascot.\r\nHe was one of the grand old bluffers of those good old days. As gullible\r\nas a schoolboy, he had managed, with his sharp eye and knowing air and\r\ntwisted blond mustaches, to pass himself off for an astute financier,\r\nand the Denver papers respectfully referred to him as the Rothschild of\r\nCripple Creek.\r\n\r\nDr. Archie stopped the Captain on his way to breakfast. \"Must see you a\r\nminute, Captain. Can't wait. Want to sell you some shares in the San\r\nFelipe. Got to raise money.\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain grandly bestowed his hat upon an eager porter who had\r\nalready lifted his fur coat tenderly from his arm and stood nursing it.\r\nIn removing his hat, the Captain exposed a bald, flushed dome, thatched\r\nabout the ears with yellowish gray hair. \"Bad time to sell, doctor. You\r\nwant to hold on to San Felipe, and buy more. What have you got to\r\nraise?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, not a great sum. Five or six thousand. I've been buying up close\r\nand have run short.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see, I see. Well, doctor, you'll have to let me get through that\r\ndoor. I was out last night, and I'm going to get my bacon, if you lose\r\nyour mine.\" He clapped Archie on the shoulder and pushed him along in\r\nfront of him. \"Come ahead with me, and we'll talk business.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie attended the Captain and waited while he gave his order,\r\ntaking the seat the old promoter indicated.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir,\" the Captain turned to him, \"you don't want to sell anything.\r\nYou must be under the impression that I'm one of these damned New\r\nEngland sharks that get their pound of flesh off the widow and orphan.\r\nIf you're a little short, sign a note and I'll write a check. That's the\r\nway gentlemen do business. If you want to put up some San Felipe as\r\ncollateral, let her go, but I shan't touch a share of it. Pens and ink,\r\nplease, Oscar,\"--he lifted a large forefinger to the Austrian.\r\n\r\nThe Captain took out his checkbook and a book of blank notes, and\r\nadjusted his nose-nippers. He wrote a few words in one book and Archie\r\nwrote a few in the other. Then they each tore across perforations and\r\nexchanged slips of paper.\r\n\r\n\"That's the way. Saves office rent,\" the Captain commented with\r\nsatisfaction, returning the books to his pocket. \"And now, Archie, where\r\nare you off to?\"\r\n\r\n\"Got to go East to-night. A deal waiting for me in New York.\" Dr. Archie\r\nrose.\r\n\r\nThe Captain's face brightened as he saw Oscar approaching with a tray,\r\nand he began tucking the corner of his napkin inside his collar, over\r\nhis ascot. \"Don't let them unload anything on you back there, doctor,\"\r\nhe said genially, \"and don't let them relieve you of anything, either.\r\nDon't let them get any Cripple stuff off you. We can manage our own\r\nsilver out here, and we're going to take it out by the ton, sir!\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor left the dining-room, and after another consultation with the\r\nclerk, he wrote his first telegram to Thea:--\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Thea Kronborg,\r\nEverett House, New York.\r\n\r\nWill call at your hotel eleven o'clock Friday morning. Glad to come.\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nARCHIE\r\n\r\n\r\nHe stood and heard the message actually clicked off on the wire, with\r\nthe feeling that she was hearing the click at the other end. Then he sat\r\ndown in the lobby and wrote a note to his wife and one to the other\r\ndoctor in Moonstone. When he at last issued out into the storm, it was\r\nwith a feeling of elation rather than of anxiety. Whatever was wrong, he\r\ncould make it right. Her letter had practically said so.\r\n\r\nHe tramped about the snowy streets, from the bank to the Union Station,\r\nwhere he shoved his money under the grating of the ticket window as if\r\nhe could not get rid of it fast enough. He had never been in New York,\r\nnever been farther east than Buffalo. \"That's rather a shame,\" he\r\nreflected boyishly as he put the long tickets in his pocket, \"for a man\r\nnearly forty years old.\" However, he thought as he walked up toward the\r\nclub, he was on the whole glad that his first trip had a human interest,\r\nthat he was going for something, and because he was wanted. He loved\r\nholidays. He felt as if he were going to Germany himself. \"Queer,\"--he\r\nwent over it with the snow blowing in his face,--\"but that sort of thing\r\nis more interesting than mines and making your daily bread. It's worth\r\npaying out to be in on it,--for a fellow like me. And when it's\r\nThea--Oh, I back her!\" he laughed aloud as he burst in at the door of\r\nthe Athletic Club, powdered with snow.\r\n\r\nArchie sat down before the New York papers and ran over the\r\nadvertisements of hotels, but he was too restless to read. Probably he\r\nhad better get a new overcoat, and he was not sure about the shape of\r\nhis collars. \"I don't want to look different to her from everybody else\r\nthere,\" he mused. \"I guess I'll go down and have Van look me over. He'll\r\nput me right.\"\r\n\r\nSo he plunged out into the snow again and started for his tailor's. When\r\nhe passed a florist's shop he stopped and looked in at the window,\r\nsmiling; how naturally pleasant things recalled one another. At the\r\ntailor's he kept whistling, \"Flow gently, Sweet Afton,\" while Van Dusen\r\nadvised him, until that resourceful tailor and haberdasher exclaimed,\r\n\"You must have a date back there, doctor; you behave like a bridegroom,\"\r\nand made him remember that he wasn't one.\r\n\r\nBefore he let him go, Van put his finger on the Masonic pin in his\r\nclient's lapel. \"Mustn't wear that, doctor. Very bad form back there.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nFRED OTTENBURG, smartly dressed for the afternoon, with a long black\r\ncoat and gaiters was sitting in the dusty parlor of the Everett House.\r\nHis manner was not in accord with his personal freshness, the good lines\r\nof his clothes, and the shining smoothness of his hair. His attitude was\r\none of deep dejection, and his face, though it had the cool,\r\nunimpeachable fairness possible only to a very blond young man, was by\r\nno means happy. A page shuffled into the room and looked about. When he\r\nmade out the dark figure in a shadowy corner, tracing over the carpet\r\npattern with a cane, he droned, \"The lady says you can come up, sir.\"\r\n\r\nFred picked up his hat and gloves and followed the creature, who seemed\r\nan aged boy in uniform, through dark corridors that smelled of old\r\ncarpets. The page knocked at the door of Thea's sitting-room, and then\r\nwandered away. Thea came to the door with a telegram in her hand. She\r\nasked Ottenburg to come in and pointed to one of the clumsy,\r\nsullen-looking chairs that were as thick as they were high. The room was\r\nbrown with time, dark in spite of two windows that opened on Union\r\nSquare, with dull curtains and carpet, and heavy, respectable-looking\r\nfurniture in somber colors. The place was saved from utter dismalness by\r\na coal fire under the black marble mantelpiece,--brilliantly reflected\r\nin a long mirror that hung between the two windows. This was the first\r\ntime Fred had seen the room, and he took it in quickly, as he put down\r\nhis hat and gloves.\r\n\r\nThea seated herself at the walnut writing-desk, still holding the slip\r\nof yellow paper. \"Dr. Archie is coming,\" she said. \"He will be here\r\nFriday morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's good, at any rate,\" her visitor replied with a determined\r\neffort at cheerfulness. Then, turning to the fire, he added blankly, \"If\r\nyou want him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I want him. I would never have asked such a thing of him if I\r\nhadn't wanted him a great deal. It's a very expensive trip.\" Thea spoke\r\nseverely. Then she went on, in a milder tone. \"He doesn't say anything\r\nabout the money, but I think his coming means that he can let me have\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nFred was standing before the mantel, rubbing his hands together\r\nnervously. \"Probably. You are still determined to call on him?\" He sat\r\ndown tentatively in the chair Thea had indicated. \"I don't see why you\r\nwon't borrow from me, and let him sign with you, for instance. That\r\nwould constitute a perfectly regular business transaction. I could bring\r\nsuit against either of you for my money.\"\r\n\r\nThea turned toward him from the desk. \"We won't take that up again,\r\nFred. I should have a different feeling about it if I went on your\r\nmoney. In a way I shall feel freer on Dr. Archie's, and in another way I\r\nshall feel more bound. I shall try even harder.\" She paused. \"He is\r\nalmost like my father,\" she added irrelevantly.\r\n\r\n\"Still, he isn't, you know,\" Fred persisted. \"It wouldn't be anything\r\nnew. I've loaned money to students before, and got it back, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I know you're generous,\" Thea hurried over it, \"but this will be\r\nthe best way. He will be here on Friday did I tell you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you mentioned it. That's rather soon. May I smoke?\" he took out\r\na small cigarette case. \"I suppose you'll be off next week?\" he asked as\r\nhe struck a match.\r\n\r\n\"Just as soon as I can,\" she replied with a restless movement of her\r\narms, as if her dark-blue dress were too tight for her. \"It seems as if\r\nI'd been here forever.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" the young man mused, \"we got in only four days ago. Facts\r\nreally don't count for much, do they? It's all in the way people feel:\r\neven in little things.\"\r\n\r\nThea winced, but she did not answer him. She put the telegram back in\r\nits envelope and placed it carefully in one of the pigeonholes of the\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" Fred brought out with effort, \"that your friend is in your\r\nconfidence?\"\r\n\r\n\"He always has been. I shall have to tell him about myself. I wish I\r\ncould without dragging you in.\"\r\n\r\nFred shook himself. \"Don't bother about where you drag me, please,\" he\r\nput in, flushing. \"I don't give--\" he subsided suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid,\" Thea went on gravely, \"that he won't understand. He'll be\r\nhard on you.\"\r\n\r\nFred studied the white ash of his cigarette before he flicked it off.\r\n\"You mean he'll see me as even worse than I am. Yes, I suppose I shall\r\nlook very low to him: a fifthrate scoundrel. But that only matters in so\r\nfar as it hurts his feelings.\"\r\n\r\nThea sighed. \"We'll both look pretty low. And after all, we must really\r\nbe just about as we shall look to him.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg started up and threw his cigarette into the grate. \"That I\r\ndeny. Have you ever been really frank with this preceptor of your\r\nchildhood, even when you WERE a child? Think a minute, have you? Of\r\ncourse not! From your cradle, as I once told you, you've been 'doing it'\r\non the side, living your own life, admitting to yourself things that\r\nwould horrify him. You've always deceived him to the extent of letting\r\nhim think you different from what you are. He couldn't understand then,\r\nhe can't understand now. So why not spare yourself and him?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \"Of course, I've had my own thoughts. Maybe he has\r\nhad his, too. But I've never done anything before that he would much\r\nmind. I must put myself right with him,--as right as I can,--to begin\r\nover. He'll make allowances for me. He always has. But I'm afraid he\r\nwon't for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave that to him and me. I take it you want me to see him?\" Fred sat\r\ndown again and began absently to trace the carpet pattern with his cane.\r\n\"At the worst,\" he spoke wanderingly, \"I thought you'd perhaps let me go\r\nin on the business end of it and invest along with you. You'd put in\r\nyour talent and ambition and hard work, and I'd put in the money\r\nand--well, nobody's good wishes are to be scorned, not even mine. Then,\r\nwhen the thing panned out big, we could share together. Your doctor\r\nfriend hasn't cared half so much about your future as I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's cared a good deal. He doesn't know as much about such things as\r\nyou do. Of course you've been a great deal more help to me than any one\r\nelse ever has,\" Thea said quietly. The black clock on the mantel began\r\nto strike. She listened to the five strokes and then said, \"I'd have\r\nliked your helping me eight months ago. But now, you'd simply be keeping\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"You weren't ready for it eight months ago.\" Fred leaned back at last in\r\nhis chair. \"You simply weren't ready for it. You were too tired. You\r\nwere too timid. Your whole tone was too low. You couldn't rise from a\r\nchair like that,\"--she had started up apprehensively and gone toward the\r\nwindow.--\"You were fumbling and awkward. Since then you've come into\r\nyour personality. You were always locking horns with it before. You were\r\na sullen little drudge eight months ago, afraid of being caught at\r\neither looking or moving like yourself. Nobody could tell anything about\r\nyou. A voice is not an instrument that's found ready-made. A voice is\r\npersonality. It can be as big as a circus and as common as\r\ndirt.--There's good money in that kind, too, but I don't happen to be\r\ninterested in them.--Nobody could tell much about what you might be able\r\nto do, last winter. I divined more than anybody else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know you did.\" Thea walked over to the oldfashioned mantel and\r\nheld her hands down to the glow of the fire. \"I owe so much to you, and\r\nthat's what makes things hard. That's why I have to get away from you\r\naltogether. I depend on you for so many things. Oh, I did even last\r\nwinter, in Chicago!\" She knelt down by the grate and held her hands\r\ncloser to the coals. \"And one thing leads to another.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg watched her as she bent toward the fire. His glance brightened\r\na little. \"Anyhow, you couldn't look as you do now, before you knew me.\r\nYou WERE clumsy. And whatever you do now, you do splendidly. And you\r\ncan't cry enough to spoil your face for more than ten minutes. It comes\r\nright back, in spite of you. It's only since you've known me that you've\r\nlet yourself be beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nWithout rising she turned her face away. Fred went on impetuously. \"Oh,\r\nyou can turn it away from me, Thea; you can take it away from me! All\r\nthe same--\" his spurt died and he fell back. \"How can you turn on me so,\r\nafter all!\" he sighed.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't. But when you arranged with yourself to take me in like that,\r\nyou couldn't have been thinking very kindly of me. I can't understand\r\nhow you carried it through, when I was so easy, and all the\r\ncircumstances were so easy.\"\r\n\r\nHer crouching position by the fire became threatening. Fred got up, and\r\nThea also rose.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said, \"I can't make you see that now. Some time later, perhaps,\r\nyou will understand better. For one thing, I honestly could not imagine\r\nthat words, names, meant so much to you.\" Fred was talking with the\r\ndesperation of a man who has put himself in the wrong and who yet feels\r\nthat there was an idea of truth in his conduct. \"Suppose that you had\r\nmarried your brakeman and lived with him year after year, caring for him\r\neven less than you do for your doctor, or for Harsanyi. I suppose you\r\nwould have felt quite all right about it, because that relation has a\r\nname in good standing. To me, that seems--sickening!\" He took a rapid\r\nturn about the room and then as Thea remained standing, he rolled one of\r\nthe elephantine chairs up to the hearth for her.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down and listen to me for a moment, Thea.\" He began pacing from the\r\nhearthrug to the window and back again, while she sat down compliantly.\r\n\"Don't you know most of the people in the world are not individuals at\r\nall? They never have an individual idea or experience. A lot of girls go\r\nto boarding-school together, come out the same season, dance at the same\r\nparties, are married off in groups, have their babies at about the same\r\ntime, send their children to school together, and so the human crop\r\nrenews itself. Such women know as much about the reality of the forms\r\nthey go through as they know about the wars they learn the dates of.\r\nThey get their most personal experiences out of novels and plays.\r\nEverything is second-hand with them. Why, you COULDN'T live like that.\"\r\n\r\nThea sat looking toward the mantel, her eyes half closed, her chin\r\nlevel, her head set as if she were enduring something. Her hands, very\r\nwhite, lay passive on her dark gown. From the window corner Fred looked\r\nat them and at her. He shook his head and flashed an angry, tormented\r\nlook out into the blue twilight over the Square, through which muffled\r\ncries and calls and the clang of car bells came up from the street. He\r\nturned again and began to pace the floor, his hands in his pockets.\r\n\r\n\"Say what you will, Thea Kronborg, you are not that sort of person. You\r\nwill never sit alone with a pacifier and a novel. You won't subsist on\r\nwhat the old ladies have put into the bottle for you. You will always\r\nbreak through into the realities. That was the first thing Harsanyi\r\nfound out about you; that you couldn't be kept on the outside. If you'd\r\nlived in Moonstone all your life and got on with the discreet brakeman,\r\nyou'd have had just the same nature. Your children would have been the\r\nrealities then, probably. If they'd been commonplace, you'd have killed\r\nthem with driving. You'd have managed some way to live twenty times as\r\nmuch as the people around you.\"\r\n\r\nFred paused. He sought along the shadowy ceiling and heavy mouldings for\r\nwords. When he began again, his voice was lower, and at first he spoke\r\nwith less conviction, though again it grew on him. \"Now I knew all\r\nthis--oh, knew it better than I can ever make you understand! You've\r\nbeen running a handicap. You had no time to lose. I wanted you to have\r\nwhat you need and to get on fast--get through with me, if need be; I\r\ncounted on that. You've no time to sit round and analyze your conduct or\r\nyour feelings. Other women give their whole lives to it. They've nothing\r\nelse to do. Helping a man to get his divorce is a career for them; just\r\nthe sort of intellectual exercise they like.\"\r\n\r\nFred dived fiercely into his pockets as if he would rip them out and\r\nscatter their contents to the winds. Stopping before her, he took a deep\r\nbreath and went on again, this time slowly. \"All that sort of thing is\r\nforeign to you. You'd be nowhere at it. You haven't that kind of mind.\r\nThe grammatical niceties of conduct are dark to you. You're simple--and\r\npoetic.\" Fred's voice seemed to be wandering about in the thickening\r\ndusk. \"You won't play much. You won't, perhaps, love many times.\" He\r\npaused. \"And you did love me, you know. Your railroad friend would have\r\nunderstood me. I COULD have thrown you back. The reverse was there,--it\r\nstared me in the face,--but I couldn't pull it. I let you drive ahead.\"\r\nHe threw out his hands. What Thea noticed, oddly enough, was the flash\r\nof the firelight on his cuff link. He turned again. \"And you'll always\r\ndrive ahead,\" he muttered. \"It's your way.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence. Fred had dropped into a chair. He seemed,\r\nafter such an explosion, not to have a word left in him. Thea put her\r\nhand to the back of her neck and pressed it, as if the muscles there\r\nwere aching.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" she said at last, \"I at least overlook more in you than I do in\r\nmyself. I am always excusing you to myself. I don't do much else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why, in Heaven's name, won't you let me be your friend? You make a\r\nscoundrel of me, borrowing money from another man to get out of my\r\nclutches.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I borrow from him, it's to study. Anything I took from you would be\r\ndifferent. As I said before, you'd be keeping me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Keeping! I like your language. It's pure Moonstone, Thea,--like your\r\npoint of view. I wonder how long you'll be a Methodist.\" He turned away\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've never said I wasn't Moonstone, have I? I am, and that's why\r\nI want Dr. Archie. I can't see anything so funny about Moonstone, you\r\nknow.\" She pushed her chair back a little from the hearth and clasped\r\nher hands over her knee, still looking thoughtfully into the red coals.\r\n\"We always come back to the same thing, Fred. The name, as you call it,\r\nmakes a difference to me how I feel about myself. You would have acted\r\nvery differently with a girl of your own kind, and that's why I can't\r\ntake anything from you now. You've made everything impossible. Being\r\nmarried is one thing and not being married is the other thing, and\r\nthat's all there is to it. I can't see how you reasoned with yourself,\r\nif you took the trouble to reason. You say I was too much alone, and yet\r\nwhat you did was to cut me off more than I ever had been. Now I'm going\r\nto try to make good to my friends out there. That's all there is left\r\nfor me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make good to your friends!\" Fred burst out. \"What one of them cares as\r\nI care, or believes as I believe? I've told you I'll never ask a\r\ngracious word from you until I can ask it with all the churches in\r\nChristendom at my back.\"\r\n\r\nThea looked up, and when she saw Fred's face, she thought sadly that he,\r\ntoo, looked as if things were spoiled for him. \"If you know me as well\r\nas you say you do, Fred,\" she said slowly, \"then you are not being\r\nhonest with yourself. You know that I can't do things halfway. If you\r\nkept me at all--you'd keep me.\" She dropped her head wearily on her hand\r\nand sat with her forehead resting on her fingers.\r\n\r\nFred leaned over her and said just above his breath, \"Then, when I get\r\nthat divorce, you'll take it up with me again? You'll at least let me\r\nknow, warn me, before there is a serious question of anybody else?\"\r\n\r\nWithout lifting her head, Thea answered him. \"Oh, I don't think there\r\nwill ever be a question of anybody else. Not if I can help it. I suppose\r\nI've given you every reason to think there will be,--at once, on\r\nshipboard, any time.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg drew himself up like a shot. \"Stop it, Thea!\" he said sharply.\r\n\"That's one thing you've never done. That's like any common woman.\" He\r\nsaw her shoulders lift a little and grow calm. Then he went to the other\r\nside of the room and took up his hat and gloves from the sofa. He came\r\nback cheerfully. \"I didn't drop in to bully you this afternoon. I came\r\nto coax you to go out for tea with me somewhere.\" He waited, but she did\r\nnot look up or lift her head, still sunk on her hand.\r\n\r\nHer handkerchief had fallen. Fred picked it up and put it on her knee,\r\npressing her fingers over it. \"Good-night, dear and wonderful,\" he\r\nwhispered,--\"wonderful and dear! How can you ever get away from me when\r\nI will always follow you, through every wall, through every door,\r\nwherever you go.\" He looked down at her bent head, and the curve of her\r\nneck that was so sad. He stooped, and with his lips just touched her\r\nhair where the firelight made it ruddiest. \"I didn't know I had it in\r\nme, Thea. I thought it was all a fairy tale. I don't know myself any\r\nmore.\" He closed his eyes and breathed deeply. \"The salt's all gone out\r\nof your hair. It's full of sun and wind again. I believe it has\r\nmemories.\" Again she heard him take a deep breath. \"I could do without\r\nyou for a lifetime, if that would give you to yourself. A woman like you\r\ndoesn't find herself, alone.\"\r\n\r\nShe thrust her free hand up to him. He kissed it softly, as if she were\r\nasleep and he were afraid of waking her.\r\n\r\nFrom the door he turned back irrelevantly. \"As to your old friend, Thea,\r\nif he's to be here on Friday, why,\"--he snatched out his watch and held\r\nit down to catch the light from the grate,--\"he's on the train now! That\r\nought to cheer you. Good-night.\" She heard the door close.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nON Friday afternoon Thea Kronborg was walking excitedly up and down her\r\nsitting-room, which at that hour was flooded by thin, clear sunshine.\r\nBoth windows were open, and the fire in the grate was low, for the day\r\nwas one of those false springs that sometimes blow into New York from\r\nthe sea in the middle of winter, soft, warm, with a persuasive salty\r\nmoisture in the air and a relaxing thaw under foot. Thea was flushed and\r\nanimated, and she seemed as restless as the sooty sparrows that chirped\r\nand cheeped distractingly about the windows. She kept looking at the\r\nblack clock, and then down into the Square. The room was full of\r\nflowers, and she stopped now and then to arrange them or to move them\r\ninto the sunlight. After the bellboy came to announce a visitor, she\r\ntook some Roman hyacinths from a glass and stuck them in the front of\r\nher dark-blue dress.\r\n\r\nWhen at last Fred Ottenburg appeared in the doorway, she met him with an\r\nexclamation of pleasure. \"I am glad you've come, Fred. I was afraid you\r\nmight not get my note, and I wanted to see you before you see Dr.\r\nArchie. He's so nice!\" She brought her hands together to emphasize her\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n\"Is he? I'm glad. You see I'm quite out of breath. I didn't wait for the\r\nelevator, but ran upstairs. I was so pleased at being sent for.\" He\r\ndropped his hat and overcoat. \"Yes, I should say he is nice! I don't\r\nseem to recognize all of these,\" waving his handkerchief about at the\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he brought them himself, in a big box. He brought lots with him\r\nbesides flowers. Oh, lots of things! The old Moonstone feeling,\"--Thea\r\nmoved her hand back and forth in the air, fluttering her fingers,--\"the\r\nfeeling of starting out, early in the morning, to take my lesson.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you've had everything out with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I haven't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't?\" He looked up in consternation.\r\n\r\n\"No, I haven't!\" Thea spoke excitedly, moving about over the sunny\r\npatches on the grimy carpet. \"I've lied to him, just as you said I had\r\nalways lied to him, and that's why I'm so happy. I've let him think what\r\nhe likes to think. Oh, I couldn't do anything else, Fred,\"--she shook\r\nher head emphatically. \"If you'd seen him when he came in, so pleased\r\nand excited! You see this is a great adventure for him. From the moment\r\nI began to talk to him, he entreated me not to say too much, not to\r\nspoil his notion of me. Not in so many words, of course. But if you'd\r\nseen his eyes, his face, his kind hands! Oh, no! I couldn't.\" She took a\r\ndeep breath, as if with a renewed sense of her narrow escape.\r\n\r\n\"Then, what did you tell him?\" Fred demanded.\r\n\r\nThea sat down on the edge of the sofa and began shutting and opening her\r\nhands nervously. \"Well, I told him enough, and not too much. I told him\r\nall about how good you were to me last winter, getting me engagements\r\nand things, and how you had helped me with my work more than anybody.\r\nThen I told him about how you sent me down to the ranch when I had no\r\nmoney or anything.\" She paused and wrinkled her forehead. \"And I told\r\nhim that I wanted to marry you and ran away to Mexico with you, and that\r\nI was awfully happy until you told me that you couldn't marry me\r\nbecause--well, I told him why.\" Thea dropped her eyes and moved the toe\r\nof her shoe about restlessly on the carpet.\r\n\r\n\"And he took it from you, like that?\" Fred asked, almost with awe.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, just like that, and asked no questions. He was hurt; he had some\r\nwretched moments. I could see him squirming and squirming and trying to\r\nget past it. He kept shutting his eyes and rubbing his forehead. But\r\nwhen I told him that I absolutely knew you wanted to marry me, that you\r\nwould whenever you could, that seemed to help him a good deal.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that satisfied him?\" Fred asked wonderingly. He could not quite\r\nimagine what kind of person Dr. Archie might be.\r\n\r\n\"He took me by the shoulders once and asked, oh, in such a frightened\r\nway, 'Thea, was he GOOD to you, this young man?' When I told him you\r\nwere, he looked at me again: 'And you care for him a great deal, you\r\nbelieve in him?' Then he seemed satisfied.\" Thea paused. \"You see, he's\r\njust tremendously good, and tremendously afraid of things--of some\r\nthings. Otherwise he would have got rid of Mrs. Archie.\" She looked up\r\nsuddenly: \"You were right, though; one can't tell people about things\r\nthey don't know already.\"\r\n\r\nFred stood in the window, his back to the sunlight, fingering the\r\njonquils. \"Yes, you can, my dear. But you must tell it in such a way\r\nthat they don't know you're telling it, and that they don't know they're\r\nhearing it.\"\r\n\r\nThea smiled past him, out into the air. \"I see. It's a secret. Like the\r\nsound in the shell.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" Fred was watching her and thinking how moving that\r\nfaraway expression, in her, happened to be. \"What did you say?\"\r\n\r\nShe came back. \"Oh, something old and Moonstony! I have almost forgotten\r\nit myself. But I feel better than I thought I ever could again. I can't\r\nwait to be off. Oh, Fred,\" she sprang up, \"I want to get at it!\"\r\n\r\nAs she broke out with this, she threw up her head and lifted herself a\r\nlittle on her toes. Fred colored and looked at her fearfully,\r\nhesitatingly. Her eyes, which looked out through the window, were\r\nbright--they had no memories. No, she did not remember. That momentary\r\nelevation had no associations for her. It was unconscious.\r\n\r\nHe looked her up and down and laughed and shook his head. \"You are just\r\nall I want you to be--and that is,--not for me! Don't worry, you'll get\r\nat it. You are at it. My God! have you ever, for one moment, been at\r\nanything else?\"\r\n\r\nThea did not answer him, and clearly she had not heard him. She was\r\nwatching something out in the thin light of the false spring and its\r\ntreacherously soft air.\r\n\r\nFred waited a moment. \"Are you going to dine with your friend to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He has never been in New York before. He wants to go about. Where\r\nshall I tell him to go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't it be a better plan, since you wish me to meet him, for you\r\nboth to dine with me? It would seem only natural and friendly. You'll\r\nhave to live up a little to his notion of us.\" Thea seemed to consider\r\nthe suggestion favorably. \"If you wish him to be easy in his mind,\" Fred\r\nwent on, \"that would help. I think, myself, that we are rather nice\r\ntogether. Put on one of the new dresses you got down there, and let him\r\nsee how lovely you can be. You owe him some pleasure, after all the\r\ntrouble he has taken.\"\r\n\r\nThea laughed, and seemed to find the idea exciting and pleasant. \"Oh,\r\nvery well! I'll do my best. Only don't wear a dress coat, please. He\r\nhasn't one, and he's nervous about it.\"\r\n\r\nFred looked at his watch. \"Your monument up there is fast. I'll be here\r\nwith a cab at eight. I'm anxious to meet him. You've given me the\r\nstrangest idea of his callow innocence and aged indifference.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \"No, he's none of that. He's very good, and he won't\r\nadmit things. I love him for it. Now, as I look back on it, I see that\r\nI've always, even when I was little, shielded him.\"\r\n\r\nAs she laughed, Fred caught the bright spark in her eye that he knew so\r\nwell, and held it for a happy instant. Then he blew her a kiss with his\r\nfinger-tips and fled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAT nine o'clock that evening our three friends were seated in the\r\nbalcony of a French restaurant, much gayer and more intimate than any\r\nthat exists in New York to-day. This old restaurant was built by a lover\r\nof pleasure, who knew that to dine gayly human beings must have the\r\nreassurance of certain limitations of space and of a certain definite\r\nstyle; that the walls must be near enough to suggest shelter, the\r\nceiling high enough to give the chandeliers a setting. The place was\r\ncrowded with the kind of people who dine late and well, and Dr. Archie,\r\nas he watched the animated groups in the long room below the balcony,\r\nfound this much the most festive scene he had ever looked out upon. He\r\nsaid to himself, in a jovial mood somewhat sustained by the cheer of the\r\nboard, that this evening alone was worth his long journey. He followed\r\nattentively the orchestra, ensconced at the farther end of the balcony,\r\nand told Thea it made him feel \"quite musical\" to recognize \"The\r\nInvitation to the Dance\" or \"The Blue Danube,\" and that he could\r\nremember just what kind of day it was when he heard her practicing them\r\nat home, and lingered at the gate to listen.\r\n\r\nFor the first few moments, when he was introduced to young Ottenburg in\r\nthe parlor of the Everett House, the doctor had been awkward and\r\nunbending. But Fred, as his father had often observed, \"was not a good\r\nmixer for nothing.\" He had brought Dr. Archie around during the short\r\ncab ride, and in an hour they had become old friends.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment when the doctor lifted his glass and, looking\r\nconsciously at Thea, said, \"To your success,\" Fred liked him. He felt\r\nhis quality; understood his courage in some directions and what Thea\r\ncalled his timidity in others, his unspent and miraculously preserved\r\nyouthfulness. Men could never impose upon the doctor, he guessed, but\r\nwomen always could. Fred liked, too, the doctor's manner with Thea, his\r\nbashful admiration and the little hesitancy by which he betrayed his\r\nconsciousness of the change in her. It was just this change that, at\r\npresent, interested Fred more than anything else. That, he felt, was his\r\n\"created value,\" and it was his best chance for any peace of mind. If\r\nthat were not real, obvious to an old friend like Archie, then he cut a\r\nvery poor figure, indeed.\r\n\r\nFred got a good deal, too, out of their talk about Moonstone. From her\r\nquestions and the doctor's answers he was able to form some conception\r\nof the little world that was almost the measure of Thea's experience,\r\nthe one bit of the human drama that she had followed with sympathy and\r\nunderstanding. As the two ran over the list of their friends, the mere\r\nsound of a name seemed to recall volumes to each of them, to indicate\r\nmines of knowledge and observation they had in common. At some names\r\nthey laughed delightedly, at some indulgently and even tenderly.\r\n\r\n\"You two young people must come out to Moonstone when Thea gets back,\"\r\nthe doctor said hospitably.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we shall!\" Fred caught it up. \"I'm keen to know all these people.\r\nIt is very tantalizing to hear only their names.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would they interest an outsider very much, do you think, Dr. Archie?\"\r\nThea leaned toward him. \"Isn't it only because we've known them since I\r\nwas little?\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor glanced at her deferentially. Fred had noticed that he seemed\r\na little afraid to look at her squarely--perhaps a trifle embarrassed by\r\na mode of dress to which he was unaccustomed. \"Well, you are practically\r\nan outsider yourself, Thea, now,\" he observed smiling. \"Oh, I know,\" he\r\nwent on quickly in response to her gesture of protest,--\"I know you\r\ndon't change toward your old friends, but you can see us all from a\r\ndistance now. It's all to your advantage that you can still take your\r\nold interest, isn't it, Mr. Ottenburg?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's exactly one of her advantages, Dr. Archie. Nobody can ever take\r\nthat away from her, and none of us who came later can ever hope to rival\r\nMoonstone in the impression we make. Her scale of values will always be\r\nthe Moonstone scale. And, with an artist, that IS an advantage.\" Fred\r\nnodded.\r\n\r\nDr. Archie looked at him seriously. \"You mean it keeps them from getting\r\naffected?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; keeps them from getting off the track generally.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the waiter filled the glasses, Fred pointed out to Thea a big\r\nblack French barytone who was eating anchovies by their tails at one of\r\nthe tables below, and the doctor looked about and studied his fellow\r\ndiners.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, Mr. Ottenburg,\" he said deeply, \"these people all look\r\nhappier to me than our Western people do. Is it simply good manners on\r\ntheir part, or do they get more out of life?\"\r\n\r\nFred laughed to Thea above the glass he had just lifted. \"Some of them\r\nare getting a good deal out of it now, doctor. This is the hour when\r\nbench-joy brightens.\"\r\n\r\nThea chuckled and darted him a quick glance. \"Benchjoy! Where did you\r\nget that slang?\"\r\n\r\n\"That happens to be very old slang, my dear. Older than Moonstone or the\r\nsovereign State of Colorado. Our old friend Mr. Nathanmeyer could tell\r\nus why it happens to hit you.\" He leaned forward and touched Thea's\r\nwrist, \"See that fur coat just coming in, Thea. It's D'Albert. He's just\r\nback from his Western tour. Fine head, hasn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"To go back,\" said Dr. Archie; \"I insist that people do look happier\r\nhere. I've noticed it even on the street, and especially in the hotels.\"\r\n\r\nFred turned to him cheerfully. \"New York people live a good deal in the\r\nfourth dimension, Dr. Archie. It's that you notice in their faces.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor was interested. \"The fourth dimension,\" he repeated slowly;\r\n\"and is that slang, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\"--Fred shook his head,--\"that's merely a figure. I mean that life\r\nis not quite so personal here as it is in your part of the world. People\r\nare more taken up by hobbies, interests that are less subject to\r\nreverses than their personal affairs. If you're interested in Thea's\r\nvoice, for instance, or in voices in general, that interest is just the\r\nsame, even if your mining stocks go down.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked at him narrowly. \"You think that's about the principal\r\ndifference between country people and city people, don't you?\"\r\n\r\nFred was a little disconcerted at being followed up so resolutely, and\r\nhe attempted to dismiss it with a pleasantry. \"I've never thought much\r\nabout it, doctor. But I should say, on the spur of the moment, that that\r\nis one of the principal differences between people anywhere. It's the\r\nconsolation of fellows like me who don't accomplish much. The fourth\r\ndimension is not good for business, but we think we have a better time.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie leaned back in his chair. His heavy shoulders were\r\ncontemplative. \"And she,\" he said slowly; \"should you say that she is\r\none of the kind you refer to?\" He inclined his head toward the shimmer\r\nof the pale-green dress beside him. Thea was leaning, just then, over\r\nthe balcony rail, her head in the light from the chandeliers below.\r\n\r\n\"Never, never!\" Fred protested. \"She's as hard-headed as the worst of\r\nyou--with a difference.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor sighed. \"Yes, with a difference; something that makes a good\r\nmany revolutions to the second. When she was little I used to feel her\r\nhead to try to locate it.\"\r\n\r\nFred laughed. \"Did you, though? So you were on the track of it? Oh, it's\r\nthere! We can't get round it, miss,\" as Thea looked back inquiringly.\r\n\"Dr. Archie, there's a fellow townsman of yours I feel a real kinship\r\nfor.\" He pressed a cigar upon Dr. Archie and struck a match for him.\r\n\"Tell me about Spanish Johnny.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor smiled benignantly through the first waves of smoke. \"Well,\r\nJohnny's an old patient of mine, and he's an old admirer of Thea's. She\r\nwas born a cosmopolitan, and I expect she learned a good deal from\r\nJohnny when she used to run away and go to Mexican Town. We thought it a\r\nqueer freak then.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor launched into a long story, in which he was often eagerly\r\ninterrupted or joyously confirmed by Thea, who was drinking her coffee\r\nand forcing open the petals of the roses with an ardent and rather rude\r\nhand. Fred settled down into enjoying his comprehension of his guests.\r\nThea, watching Dr. Archie and interested in his presentation, was\r\nunconsciously impersonating her suave, gold-tinted friend. It was\r\ndelightful to see her so radiant and responsive again. She had kept her\r\npromise about looking her best; when one could so easily get together\r\nthe colors of an apple branch in early spring, that was not hard to do.\r\nEven Dr. Archie felt, each time he looked at her, a fresh consciousness.\r\nHe recognized the fine texture of her mother's skin, with the difference\r\nthat, when she reached across the table to give him a bunch of grapes,\r\nher arm was not only white, but somehow a little dazzling. She seemed to\r\nhim taller, and freer in all her movements. She had now a way of taking\r\na deep breath when she was interested, that made her seem very strong,\r\nsomehow, and brought her at one quite overpoweringly. If he seemed shy,\r\nit was not that he was intimidated by her worldly clothes, but that her\r\ngreater positiveness, her whole augmented self, made him feel that his\r\naccustomed manner toward her was inadequate.\r\n\r\nFred, on his part, was reflecting that the awkward position in which he\r\nhad placed her would not confine or chafe her long. She looked about at\r\nother people, at other women, curiously. She was not quite sure of\r\nherself, but she was not in the least afraid or apologetic. She seemed\r\nto sit there on the edge, emerging from one world into another, taking\r\nher bearings, getting an idea of the concerted movement about her, but\r\nwith absolute self-confidence. So far from shrinking, she expanded. The\r\nmere kindly effort to please Dr. Archie was enough to bring her out.\r\n\r\nThere was much talk of aurae at that time, and Fred mused that every\r\nbeautiful, every compellingly beautiful woman, had an aura, whether\r\nother people did or no. There was, certainly, about the woman he had\r\nbrought up from Mexico, such an emanation. She existed in more space\r\nthan she occupied by measurement. The enveloping air about her head and\r\nshoulders was subsidized--was more moving than she herself, for in it\r\nlived the awakenings, all the first sweetness that life kills in people.\r\nOne felt in her such a wealth of JUGENDZEIT, all those flowers of the\r\nmind and the blood that bloom and perish by the myriad in the few\r\nexhaustless years when the imagination first kindles. It was in watching\r\nher as she emerged like this, in being near and not too near, that one\r\ngot, for a moment, so much that one had lost; among other legendary\r\nthings the legendary theme of the absolutely magical power of a\r\nbeautiful woman.\r\n\r\nAfter they had left Thea at her hotel, Dr. Archie admitted to Fred, as\r\nthey walked up Broadway through the rapidly chilling air, that once\r\nbefore he had seen their young friend flash up into a more potent self,\r\nbut in a darker mood. It was in his office one night, when she was at\r\nhome the summer before last. \"And then I got the idea,\" he added simply,\r\n\"that she would not live like other people: that, for better or worse,\r\nshe had uncommon gifts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we'll see that it's for better, you and I,\" Fred reassured him.\r\n\"Won't you come up to my hotel with me? I think we ought to have a long\r\ntalk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Dr. Archie gratefully; \"I think we ought.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHEA was to sail on Tuesday, at noon, and on Saturday Fred Ottenburg\r\narranged for her passage, while she and Dr. Archie went shopping. With\r\nrugs and sea-clothes she was already provided; Fred had got everything\r\nof that sort she needed for the voyage up from Vera Cruz. On Sunday\r\nafternoon Thea went to see the Harsanyis. When she returned to her\r\nhotel, she found a note from Ottenburg, saying that he had called and\r\nwould come again to-morrow.\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning, while she was at breakfast, Fred came in. She knew by\r\nhis hurried, distracted air as he entered the dining-room that something\r\nhad gone wrong. He had just got a telegram from home. His mother had\r\nbeen thrown from her carriage and hurt; a concussion of some sort, and\r\nshe was unconscious. He was leaving for St. Louis that night on the\r\neleven o'clock train. He had a great deal to attend to during the day.\r\nHe would come that evening, if he might, and stay with her until train\r\ntime, while she was doing her packing. Scarcely waiting for her consent,\r\nhe hurried away.\r\n\r\nAll day Thea was somewhat cast down. She was sorry for Fred, and she\r\nmissed the feeling that she was the one person in his mind. He had\r\nscarcely looked at her when they exchanged words at the breakfast-table.\r\nShe felt as if she were set aside, and she did not seem so important\r\neven to herself as she had yesterday. Certainly, she reflected, it was\r\nhigh time that she began to take care of herself again. Dr. Archie came\r\nfor dinner, but she sent him away early, telling him that she would be\r\nready to go to the boat with him at half-past ten the next morning. When\r\nshe went upstairs, she looked gloomily at the open trunk in her\r\nsitting-room, and at the trays piled on the sofa. She stood at the\r\nwindow and watched a quiet snowstorm spending itself over the city. More\r\nthan anything else, falling snow always made her think of Moonstone; of\r\nthe Kohlers' garden, of Thor's sled, of dressing by lamplight and\r\nstarting off to school before the paths were broken.\r\n\r\nWhen Fred came, he looked tired, and he took her hand almost without\r\nseeing her.\r\n\r\n\"I'm so sorry, Fred. Have you had any more word?\"\r\n\r\n\"She was still unconscious at four this afternoon. It doesn't look very\r\nencouraging.\" He approached the fire and warmed his hands. He seemed to\r\nhave contracted, and he had not at all his habitual ease of manner.\r\n\"Poor mother!\" he exclaimed; \"nothing like this should have happened to\r\nher. She has so much pride of person. She's not at all an old woman, you\r\nknow. She's never got beyond vigorous and rather dashing middle age.\" He\r\nturned abruptly to Thea and for the first time really looked at her.\r\n\"How badly things come out! She'd have liked you for a daughter-in-law.\r\nOh, you'd have fought like the devil, but you'd have respected each\r\nother.\" He sank into a chair and thrust his feet out to the fire.\r\n\"Still,\" he went on thoughtfully, seeming to address the ceiling, \"it\r\nmight have been bad for you. Our big German houses, our good German\r\ncooking--you might have got lost in the upholstery. That substantial\r\ncomfort might take the temper out of you, dull your edge. Yes,\" he\r\nsighed, \"I guess you were meant for the jolt of the breakers.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess I'll get plenty of jolt,\" Thea murmured, turning to her trunk.\r\n\r\n\"I'm rather glad I'm not staying over until to-morrow,\" Fred reflected.\r\n\"I think it's easier for me to glide out like this. I feel now as if\r\neverything were rather casual, anyhow. A thing like that dulls one's\r\nfeelings.\"\r\n\r\nThea, standing by her trunk, made no reply. Presently he shook himself\r\nand rose. \"Want me to put those trays in for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you. I'm not ready for them yet.\"\r\n\r\nFred strolled over to the sofa, lifted a scarf from one of the trays and\r\nstood abstractedly drawing it through his fingers. \"You've been so kind\r\nthese last few days, Thea, that I began to hope you might soften a\r\nlittle; that you might ask me to come over and see you this summer.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you thought that, you were mistaken,\" she said slowly. \"I've\r\nhardened, if anything. But I shan't carry any grudge away with me, if\r\nyou mean that.\"\r\n\r\nHe dropped the scarf. \"And there's nothing--nothing at all you'll let me\r\ndo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there is one thing, and it's a good deal to ask. If I get knocked\r\nout, or never get on, I'd like you to see that Dr. Archie gets his money\r\nback. I'm taking three thousand dollars of his.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course I shall. You may dismiss that from your mind. How fussy\r\nyou are about money, Thea. You make such a point of it.\" He turned\r\nsharply and walked to the windows.\r\n\r\nThea sat down in the chair he had quitted. \"It's only poor people who\r\nfeel that way about money, and who are really honest,\" she said gravely.\r\n\"Sometimes I think that to be really honest, you must have been so poor\r\nthat you've been tempted to steal.\"\r\n\r\n\"To what?\"\r\n\r\n\"To steal. I used to be, when I first went to Chicago and saw all the\r\nthings in the big stores there. Never anything big, but little things,\r\nthe kind I'd never seen before and could never afford. I did take\r\nsomething once, before I knew it.\"\r\n\r\nFred came toward her. For the first time she had his whole attention, in\r\nthe degree to which she was accustomed to having it. \"Did you? What was\r\nit?\" he asked with interest.\r\n\r\n\"A sachet. A little blue silk bag of orris-root powder. There was a\r\nwhole counterful of them, marked down to fifty cents. I'd never seen any\r\nbefore, and they seemed irresistible. I took one up and wandered about\r\nthe store with it. Nobody seemed to notice, so I carried it off.\"\r\n\r\nFred laughed. \"Crazy child! Why, your things always smell of orris; is\r\nit a penance?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I love it. But I saw that the firm didn't lose anything by me. I\r\nwent back and bought it there whenever I had a quarter to spend. I got a\r\nlot to take to Arizona. I made it up to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet you did!\" Fred took her hand. \"Why didn't I find you that\r\nfirst winter? I'd have loved you just as you came!\"\r\n\r\nThea shook her head. \"No, you wouldn't, but you might have found me\r\namusing. The Harsanyis said yesterday afternoon that I wore such a funny\r\ncape and that my shoes always squeaked. They think I've improved. I told\r\nthem it was your doing if I had, and then they looked scared.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you sing for Harsanyi?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He thinks I've improved there, too. He said nice things to me. Oh,\r\nhe was very nice! He agrees with you about my going to Lehmann, if\r\nshe'll take me. He came out to the elevator with me, after we had said\r\ngood-bye. He said something nice out there, too, but he seemed sad.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was it that he said?\"\r\n\r\n\"He said, 'When people, serious people, believe in you, they give you\r\nsome of their best, so--take care of it, Miss Kronborg.' Then he waved\r\nhis hands and went back.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you sang, I wish you had taken me along. Did you sing well?\" Fred\r\nturned from her and went back to the window. \"I wonder when I shall hear\r\nyou sing again.\" He picked up a bunch of violets and smelled them. \"You\r\nknow, your leaving me like this--well, it's almost inhuman to be able to\r\ndo it so kindly and unconditionally.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it is. It was almost inhuman to be able to leave home,\r\ntoo,--the last time, when I knew it was for good. But all the same, I\r\ncared a great deal more than anybody else did. I lived through it. I\r\nhave no choice now. No matter how much it breaks me up, I have to go. Do\r\nI seem to enjoy it?\"\r\n\r\nFred bent over her trunk and picked up something which proved to be a\r\nscore, clumsily bound. \"What's this? Did you ever try to sing this?\" He\r\nopened it and on the engraved title-page read Wunsch's inscription,\r\n\"EINST, O WUNDER!\" He looked up sharply at Thea.\r\n\r\n\"Wunsch gave me that when he went away. I've told you about him, my old\r\nteacher in Moonstone. He loved that opera.\"\r\n\r\nFred went toward the fireplace, the book under his arm, singing\r\nsoftly:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"EINST, O WUNDER, ENTBLUHT AUF MEINEM GRABE,\r\nEINE BLUME DER ASCHE MEINES HERZENS;\"\r\n\r\n\"You have no idea at all where he is, Thea?\" He leaned against the\r\nmantel and looked down at her.\r\n\r\n\"No, I wish I had. He may be dead by this time. That was five years ago,\r\nand he used himself hard. Mrs. Kohler was always afraid he would die off\r\nalone somewhere and be stuck under the prairie. When we last heard of\r\nhim, he was in Kansas.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he were to be found, I'd like to do something for him. I seem to get\r\na good deal of him from this.\" He opened the book again, where he kept\r\nthe place with his finger, and scrutinized the purple ink. \"How like a\r\nGerman! Had he ever sung the song for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I didn't know where the words were from until once, when Harsanyi\r\nsang it for me, I recognized them.\"\r\n\r\nFred closed the book. \"Let me see, what was your noble brakeman's name?\"\r\n\r\nThea looked up with surprise. \"Ray, Ray Kennedy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ray Kennedy!\" he laughed. \"It couldn't well have been better! Wunsch\r\nand Dr. Archie, and Ray, and I,\"--he told them off on his\r\nfingers,--\"your whistling-posts! You haven't done so badly. We've backed\r\nyou as we could, some in our weakness and some in our might. In your\r\ndark hours--and you'll have them--you may like to remember us.\" He\r\nsmiled whimsically and dropped the score into the trunk. \"You are taking\r\nthat with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely I am. I haven't so many keepsakes that I can afford to leave\r\nthat. I haven't got many that I value so highly.\"\r\n\r\n\"That you value so highly?\" Fred echoed her gravity playfully. \"You are\r\ndelicious when you fall into your vernacular.\" He laughed half to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with that? Isn't it perfectly good English?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly good Moonstone, my dear. Like the readymade clothes that hang\r\nin the windows, made to fit everybody and fit nobody, a phrase that can\r\nbe used on all occasions. Oh,\"--he started across the room\r\nagain,--\"that's one of the fine things about your going! You'll be with\r\nthe right sort of people and you'll learn a good, live, warm German,\r\nthat will be like yourself. You'll get a new speech full of shades and\r\ncolor like your voice; alive, like your mind. It will be almost like\r\nbeing born again, Thea.\"\r\n\r\nShe was not offended. Fred had said such things to her before, and she\r\nwanted to learn. In the natural course of things she would never have\r\nloved a man from whom she could not learn a great deal.\r\n\r\n\"Harsanyi said once,\" she remarked thoughtfully, \"that if one became an\r\nartist one had to be born again, and that one owed nothing to anybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. And when I see you again I shall not see you, but your\r\ndaughter. May I?\" He held up his cigarette case questioningly and then\r\nbegan to smoke, taking up again the song which ran in his head:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"DEUTLICH SCHIMMERT AUF JEDEM, PURPURBLATTCHEN, ADELAIDE!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have half an hour with you yet, and then, exit Fred.\" He walked about\r\nthe room, smoking and singing the words under his breath. \"You'll like\r\nthe voyage,\" he said abruptly. \"That first approach to a foreign shore,\r\nstealing up on it and finding it--there's nothing like it. It wakes up\r\neverything that's asleep in you. You won't mind my writing to some\r\npeople in Berlin? They'll be nice to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would.\" Thea gave a deep sigh. \"I wish one could look ahead\r\nand see what is coming to one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no!\" Fred was smoking nervously; \"that would never do. It's the\r\nuncertainty that makes one try. You've never had any sort of chance, and\r\nnow I fancy you'll make it up to yourself. You'll find the way to let\r\nyourself out in one long flight.\"\r\n\r\nThea put her hand on her heart. \"And then drop like the rocks we used to\r\nthrow--anywhere.\" She left the chair and went over to the sofa, hunting\r\nfor something in the trunk trays. When she came back she found Fred\r\nsitting in her place. \"Here are some handkerchiefs of yours. I've kept\r\none or two. They're larger than mine and useful if one has a headache.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. How nicely they smell of your things!\" He looked at the\r\nwhite squares for a moment and then put them in his pocket. He kept the\r\nlow chair, and as she stood beside him he took her hands and sat looking\r\nintently at them, as if he were examining them for some special purpose,\r\ntracing the long round fingers with the tips of his own. \"Ordinarily,\r\nyou know, there are reefs that a man catches to and keeps his nose above\r\nwater. But this is a case by itself. There seems to be no limit as to\r\nhow much I can be in love with you. I keep going.\" He did not lift his\r\neyes from her fingers, which he continued to study with the same fervor.\r\n\"Every kind of stringed instrument there is plays in your hands, Thea,\"\r\nhe whispered, pressing them to his face.\r\n\r\nShe dropped beside him and slipped into his arms, shutting her eyes and\r\nlifting her cheek to his. \"Tell me one thing,\" Fred whispered. \"You said\r\nthat night on the boat, when I first told you, that if you could you\r\nwould crush it all up in your hands and throw it into the sea. Would\r\nyou, all those weeks?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"Answer me, would you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I was angry then. I'm not now. I'd never give them up. Don't make\r\nme pay too much.\" In that embrace they lived over again all the others.\r\nWhen Thea drew away from him, she dropped her face in her hands. \"You\r\nare good to me,\" she breathed, \"you are!\"\r\n\r\nRising to his feet, he put his hands under her elbows and lifted her\r\ngently. He drew her toward the door with him. \"Get all you can. Be\r\ngenerous with yourself. Don't stop short of splendid things. I want them\r\nfor you more than I want anything else, more than I want one splendid\r\nthing for myself. I can't help feeling that you'll gain, somehow, by my\r\nlosing so much. That you'll gain the very thing I lose. Take care of\r\nher, as Harsanyi said. She's wonderful!\" He kissed her and went out of\r\nthe door without looking back, just as if he were coming again\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\nThea went quickly into her bedroom. She brought out an armful of muslin\r\nthings, knelt down, and began to lay them in the trays. Suddenly she\r\nstopped, dropped forward and leaned against the open trunk, her head on\r\nher arms. The tears fell down on the dark old carpet. It came over her\r\nhow many people must have said good-bye and been unhappy in that room.\r\nOther people, before her time, had hired this room to cry in. Strange\r\nrooms and strange streets and faces, how sick at heart they made one!\r\nWhy was she going so far, when what she wanted was some familiar place\r\nto hide in?--the rock house, her little room in Moonstone, her own bed.\r\nOh, how good it would be to lie down in that little bed, to cut the\r\nnerve that kept one struggling, that pulled one on and on, to sink into\r\npeace there, with all the family safe and happy downstairs. After all,\r\nshe was a Moonstone girl, one of the preacher's children. Everything\r\nelse was in Fred's imagination. Why was she called upon to take such\r\nchances? Any safe, humdrum work that did not compromise her would be\r\nbetter. But if she failed now, she would lose her soul. There was\r\nnowhere to fall, after one took that step, except into abysses of\r\nwretchedness. She knew what abysses, for she could still hear the old\r\nman playing in the snowstorm, it was released in her like a passion of\r\nlonging. Every nerve in her body thrilled to it. It brought her to her\r\nfeet, carried her somehow to bed and into troubled sleep.\r\n\r\nThat night she taught in Moonstone again: she beat her pupils in hideous\r\nrages, she kept on beating them. She sang at funerals, and struggled at\r\nthe piano with Harsanyi. In one dream she was looking into a hand-glass\r\nand thinking that she was getting better-looking, when the glass began\r\nto grow smaller and smaller and her own reflection to shrink, until she\r\nrealized that she was looking into Ray Kennedy's eyes, seeing her face\r\nin that look of his which she could never forget. All at once the eyes\r\nwere Fred Ottenburg's, and not Ray's. All night she heard the shrieking\r\nof trains, whistling in and out of Moonstone, as she used to hear them\r\nin her sleep when they blew shrill in the winter air. But to-night they\r\nwere terrifying,--the spectral, fated trains that \"raced with death,\"\r\nabout which the old woman from the depot used to pray.\r\n\r\nIn the morning she wakened breathless after a struggle with Mrs. Livery\r\nJohnson's daughter. She started up with a bound, threw the blankets back\r\nand sat on the edge of the bed, her night-dress open, her long braids\r\nhanging over her bosom, blinking at the daylight. After all, it was not\r\ntoo late. She was only twenty years old, and the boat sailed at noon.\r\nThere was still time!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VI. KRONBORG\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIt is a glorious winter day. Denver, standing on her high plateau under\r\na thrilling green-blue sky, is masked in snow and glittering with\r\nsunlight. The Capitol building is actually in armor, and throws off the\r\nshafts of the sun until the beholder is dazzled and the outlines of the\r\nbuilding are lost in a blaze of reflected light. The stone terrace is a\r\nwhite field over which fiery reflections dance, and the trees and bushes\r\nare faithfully repeated in snow--on every black twig a soft, blurred\r\nline of white. From the terrace one looks directly over to where the\r\nmountains break in their sharp, familiar lines against the sky. Snow\r\nfills the gorges, hangs in scarfs on the great slopes, and on the peaks\r\nthe fiery sunshine is gathered up as by a burning-glass.\r\n\r\nHoward Archie is standing at the window of his private room in the\r\noffices of the San Felipe Mining Company, on the sixth floor of the\r\nRaton Building, looking off at the mountain glories of his State while\r\nhe gives dictation to his secretary. He is ten years older than when we\r\nsaw him last, and emphatically ten years more prosperous. A decade of\r\ncoming into things has not so much aged him as it has fortified,\r\nsmoothed, and assured him. His sandy hair and imperial conceal whatever\r\ngray they harbor. He has not grown heavier, but more flexible, and his\r\nmassive shoulders carry fifty years and the control of his great mining\r\ninterests more lightly than they carried forty years and a country\r\npractice. In short, he is one of the friends to whom we feel grateful\r\nfor having got on in the world, for helping to keep up the general\r\ntemperature and our own confidence in life. He is an acquaintance that\r\none would hurry to overtake and greet among a hundred. In his warm\r\nhandshake and generous smile there is the stimulating cordiality of good\r\nfellows come into good fortune and eager to pass it on; something that\r\nmakes one think better of the lottery of life and resolve to try again.\r\n\r\nWhen Archie had finished his morning mail, he turned away from the\r\nwindow and faced his secretary. \"Did anything come up yesterday\r\nafternoon while I was away, T. B.?\"\r\n\r\nThomas Burk turned over the leaf of his calendar. \"Governor Alden sent\r\ndown to say that he wanted to see you before he sends his letter to the\r\nBoard of Pardons. Asked if you could go over to the State House this\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\nArchie shrugged his shoulders. \"I'll think about it.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man grinned.\r\n\r\n\"Anything else?\" his chief continued.\r\n\r\nT. B. swung round in his chair with a look of interest on his shrewd,\r\nclean-shaven face. \"Old Jasper Flight was in, Dr. Archie. I never\r\nexpected to see him alive again. Seems he's tucked away for the winter\r\nwith a sister who's a housekeeper at the Oxford. He's all crippled up\r\nwith rheumatism, but as fierce after it as ever. Wants to know if you or\r\nthe company won't grub-stake him again. Says he's sure of it this time;\r\nhad located something when the snow shut down on him in December. He\r\nwants to crawl out at the first break in the weather, with that same old\r\nburro with the split ear. He got somebody to winter the beast for him.\r\nHe's superstitious about that burro, too; thinks it's divinely guided.\r\nYou ought to hear the line of talk he put up here yesterday; said when\r\nhe rode in his carriage, that burro was a-going to ride along with him.\"\r\n\r\nArchie laughed. \"Did he leave you his address?\"\r\n\r\n\"He didn't neglect anything,\" replied the clerk cynically.\r\n\r\n\"Well, send him a line and tell him to come in again. I like to hear\r\nhim. Of all the crazy prospectors I've ever known, he's the most\r\ninteresting, because he's really crazy. It's a religious conviction with\r\nhim, and with most of 'em it's a gambling fever or pure vagrancy. But\r\nJasper Flight believes that the Almighty keeps the secret of the silver\r\ndeposits in these hills, and gives it away to the deserving. He's a\r\ndownright noble figure. Of course I'll stake him! As long as he can\r\ncrawl out in the spring. He and that burro are a sight together. The\r\nbeast is nearly as white as Jasper; must be twenty years old.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you stake him this time, you won't have to again,\" said T. B.\r\nknowingly. \"He'll croak up there, mark my word. Says he never ties the\r\nburro at night now, for fear he might be called sudden, and the beast\r\nwould starve. I guess that animal could eat a lariat rope, all right,\r\nand enjoy it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess if we knew the things those two have eaten, and haven't eaten,\r\nin their time, T. B., it would make us vegetarians.\" The doctor sat down\r\nand looked thoughtful. \"That's the way for the old man to go. It would\r\nbe pretty hard luck if he had to die in a hospital. I wish he could turn\r\nup something before he cashes in. But his kind seldom do; they're\r\nbewitched. Still, there was Stratton. I've been meeting Jasper Flight,\r\nand his side meat and tin pans, up in the mountains for years, and I'd\r\nmiss him. I always halfway believe the fairy tales he spins me. Old\r\nJasper Flight,\" Archie murmured, as if he liked the name or the picture\r\nit called up.\r\n\r\nA clerk came in from the outer office and handed Archie a card. He\r\nsprang up and exclaimed, \"Mr. Ottenburg? Bring him in.\"\r\n\r\nFred Ottenburg entered, clad in a long, fur-lined coat, holding a\r\nchecked-cloth hat in his hand, his cheeks and eyes bright with the\r\noutdoor cold. The two men met before Archie's desk and their handclasp\r\nwas longer than friendship prompts except in regions where the blood\r\nwarms and quickens to meet the dry cold. Under the general keyingup of\r\nthe altitude, manners take on a heartiness, a vivacity, that is one\r\nexpression of the half-unconscious excitement which Colorado people miss\r\nwhen they drop into lower strata of air. The heart, we are told, wears\r\nout early in that high atmosphere, but while it pumps it sends out no\r\nsluggish stream. Our two friends stood gripping each other by the hand\r\nand smiling.\r\n\r\n\"When did you get in, Fred? And what have you come for?\" Archie gave him\r\na quizzical glance.\r\n\r\n\"I've come to find out what you think you're doing out here,\" the\r\nyounger man declared emphatically. \"I want to get next, I do. When can\r\nyou see me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything on to-night? Then suppose you dine with me. Where can I pick\r\nyou up at five-thirty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bixby's office, general freight agent of the Burlington.\" Ottenburg\r\nbegan to button his overcoat and drew on his gloves. \"I've got to have\r\none shot at you before I go, Archie. Didn't I tell you Pinky Alden was a\r\ncheap squirt?\"\r\n\r\nAlden's backer laughed and shook his head. \"Oh, he's worse than that,\r\nFred. It isn't polite to mention what he is, outside of the Arabian\r\nNights. I guessed you'd come to rub it into me.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg paused, his hand on the doorknob, his high color challenging\r\nthe doctor's calm. \"I'm disgusted with you, Archie, for training with\r\nsuch a pup. A man of your experience!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he's been an experience,\" Archie muttered. \"I'm not coy about\r\nadmitting it, am I?\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg flung open the door. \"Small credit to you. Even the women are\r\nout for capital and corruption, I hear. Your Governor's done more for\r\nthe United Breweries in six months than I've been able to do in six\r\nyears. He's the lily-livered sort we're looking for. Good-morning.\"\r\n\r\nThat afternoon at five o'clock Dr. Archie emerged from the State House\r\nafter his talk with Governor Alden, and crossed the terrace under a\r\nsaffron sky. The snow, beaten hard, was blue in the dusk; a day of\r\nblinding sunlight had not even started a thaw. The lights of the city\r\ntwinkled pale below him in the quivering violet air, and the dome of the\r\nState House behind him was still red with the light from the west.\r\nBefore he got into his car, the doctor paused to look about him at the\r\nscene of which he never tired. Archie lived in his own house on Colfax\r\nAvenue, where he had roomy grounds and a rose garden and a conservatory.\r\nHis housekeeping was done by three Japanese boys, devoted and\r\nresourceful, who were able to manage Archie's dinner parties, to see\r\nthat he kept his engagements, and to make visitors who stayed at the\r\nhouse so comfortable that they were always loath to go away.\r\n\r\nArchie had never known what comfort was until he became a widower,\r\nthough with characteristic delicacy, or dishonesty, he insisted upon\r\naccrediting his peace of mind to the San Felipe, to Time, to anything\r\nbut his release from Mrs. Archie.\r\n\r\nMrs. Archie died just before her husband left Moonstone and came to\r\nDenver to live, six years ago. The poor woman's fight against dust was\r\nher undoing at last. One summer day when she was rubbing the parlor\r\nupholstery with gasoline,--the doctor had often forbidden her to use it\r\non any account, so that was one of the pleasures she seized upon in his\r\nabsence,--an explosion occurred. Nobody ever knew exactly how it\r\nhappened, for Mrs. Archie was dead when the neighbors rushed in to save\r\nher from the burning house. She must have inhaled the burning gas and\r\ndied instantly.\r\n\r\nMoonstone severity relented toward her somewhat after her death. But\r\neven while her old cronies at Mrs. Smiley's millinery store said that it\r\nwas a terrible thing, they added that nothing but a powerful explosive\r\nCOULD have killed Mrs. Archie, and that it was only right the doctor\r\nshould have a chance.\r\n\r\nArchie's past was literally destroyed when his wife died. The house\r\nburned to the ground, and all those material reminders which have such\r\npower over people disappeared in an hour. His mining interests now took\r\nhim to Denver so often that it seemed better to make his headquarters\r\nthere. He gave up his practice and left Moonstone for good. Six months\r\nafterward, while Dr. Archie was living at the Brown Palace Hotel, the\r\nSan Felipe mine began to give up that silver hoard which old Captain\r\nHarris had always accused it of concealing, and San Felipe headed the\r\nlist of mining quotations in every daily paper, East and West. In a few\r\nyears Dr. Archie was a very rich man. His mine was such an important\r\nitem in the mineral output of the State, and Archie had a hand in so\r\nmany of the new industries of Colorado and New Mexico, that his\r\npolitical influence was considerable. He had thrown it all, two years\r\nago, to the new reform party, and had brought about the election of a\r\ngovernor of whose conduct he was now heartily ashamed. His friends\r\nbelieved that Archie himself had ambitious political plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWHEN Ottenburg and his host reached the house on Colfax Avenue, they\r\nwent directly to the library, a long double room on the second floor\r\nwhich Archie had arranged exactly to his own taste. It was full of books\r\nand mounted specimens of wild game, with a big writing-table at either\r\nend, stiff, old-fashioned engravings, heavy hangings and deep\r\nupholstery.\r\n\r\nWhen one of the Japanese boys brought the cocktails, Fred turned from\r\nthe fine specimen of peccoray he had been examining and said, \"A man is\r\nan owl to live in such a place alone, Archie. Why don't you marry? As\r\nfor me, just because I can't marry, I find the world full of charming,\r\nunattached women, any one of whom I could fit up a house for with\r\nalacrity.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're more knowing than I.\" Archie spoke politely. \"I'm not very wide\r\nawake about women. I'd be likely to pick out one of the uncomfortable\r\nones--and there are a few of them, you know.\" He drank his cocktail and\r\nrubbed his hands together in a friendly way. \"My friends here have\r\ncharming wives, and they don't give me a chance to get lonely. They are\r\nvery kind to me, and I have a great many pleasant friendships.\"\r\n\r\nFred put down his glass. \"Yes, I've always noticed that women have\r\nconfidence in you. You have the doctor's way of getting next. And you\r\nenjoy that kind of thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"The friendship of attractive women? Oh, dear, yes! I depend upon it a\r\ngreat deal.\"\r\n\r\nThe butler announced dinner, and the two men went downstairs to the\r\ndining-room. Dr. Archie's dinners were always good and well served, and\r\nhis wines were excellent.\r\n\r\n\"I saw the Fuel and Iron people to-day,\" Ottenburg said, looking up from\r\nhis soup. \"Their heart is in the right place. I can't see why in the\r\nmischief you ever got mixed up with that reform gang, Archie. You've got\r\nnothing to reform out here. The situation has always been as simple as\r\ntwo and two in Colorado; mostly a matter of a friendly understanding.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\"--Archie spoke tolerantly,--\"some of the young fellows seemed to\r\nhave red-hot convictions, and I thought it was better to let them try\r\ntheir ideas out.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg shrugged his shoulders. \"A few dull young men who haven't\r\nability enough to play the old game the old way, so they want to put on\r\na new game which doesn't take so much brains and gives away more\r\nadvertising that's what your anti-saloon league and vice commission\r\namounts to. They provide notoriety for the fellows who can't distinguish\r\nthemselves at running a business or practicing law or developing an\r\nindustry. Here you have a mediocre lawyer with no brains and no\r\npractice, trying to get a look-in on something. He comes up with the\r\nnovel proposition that the prostitute has a hard time of it, puts his\r\npicture in the paper, and the first thing you know, he's a celebrity. He\r\ngets the rake-off and she's just where she was before. How could you\r\nfall for a mouse-trap like Pink Alden, Archie?\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie laughed as he began to carve. \"Pink seems to get under your\r\nskin. He's not worth talking about. He's gone his limit. People won't\r\nread about his blameless life any more. I knew those interviews he gave\r\nout would cook him. They were a last resort. I could have stopped him,\r\nbut by that time I'd come to the conclusion that I'd let the reformers\r\ndown. I'm not against a general shaking-up, but the trouble with Pinky's\r\ncrowd is they never get beyond a general writing-up. We gave them a\r\nchance to do something, and they just kept on writing about each other\r\nand what temptations they had overcome.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Archie and his friend were busy with Colorado politics, the\r\nimpeccable Japanese attended swiftly and intelligently to his duties,\r\nand the dinner, as Ottenburg at last remarked, was worthy of more\r\nprofitable conversation.\r\n\r\n\"So it is,\" the doctor admitted. \"Well, we'll go upstairs for our coffee\r\nand cut this out. Bring up some cognac and arak, Tai,\" he added as he\r\nrose from the table.\r\n\r\nThey stopped to examine a moose's head on the stairway, and when they\r\nreached the library the pine logs in the fireplace had been lighted, and\r\nthe coffee was bubbling before the hearth. Tai placed two chairs before\r\nthe fire and brought a tray of cigarettes.\r\n\r\n\"Bring the cigars in my lower desk drawer, boy,\" the doctor directed.\r\n\"Too much light in here, isn't there, Fred? Light the lamp there on my\r\ndesk, Tai.\" He turned off the electric glare and settled himself deep\r\ninto the chair opposite Ottenburg's.\r\n\r\n\"To go back to our conversation, doctor,\" Fred began while he waited for\r\nthe first steam to blow off his coffee; \"why don't you make up your mind\r\nto go to Washington? There'd be no fight made against you. I needn't say\r\nthe United Breweries would back you. There'd be some KUDOS coming to us,\r\ntoo; backing a reform candidate.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie measured his length in his chair and thrust his large boots\r\ntoward the crackling pitch-pine. He drank his coffee and lit a big black\r\ncigar while his guest looked over the assortment of cigarettes on the\r\ntray. \"You say why don't I,\" the doctor spoke with the deliberation of a\r\nman in the position of having several courses to choose from, \"but, on\r\nthe other hand, why should I?\" He puffed away and seemed, through his\r\nhalf-closed eyes, to look down several long roads with the intention of\r\nluxuriously rejecting all of them and remaining where he was. \"I'm sick\r\nof politics. I'm disillusioned about serving my crowd, and I don't\r\nparticularly want to serve yours. Nothing in it that I particularly\r\nwant; and a man's not effective in politics unless he wants something\r\nfor himself, and wants it hard. I can reach my ends by straighter roads.\r\nThere are plenty of things to keep me busy. We haven't begun to develop\r\nour resources in this State; we haven't had a look in on them yet.\r\nThat's the only thing that isn't fake--making men and machines go, and\r\nactually turning out a product.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor poured himself some white cordial and looked over the little\r\nglass into the fire with an expression which led Ottenburg to believe\r\nthat he was getting at something in his own mind. Fred lit a cigarette\r\nand let his friend grope for his idea.\r\n\r\n\"My boys, here,\" Archie went on, \"have got me rather interested in\r\nJapan. Think I'll go out there in the spring, and come back the other\r\nway, through Siberia. I've always wanted to go to Russia.\" His eyes\r\nstill hunted for something in his big fireplace. With a slow turn of his\r\nhead he brought them back to his guest and fixed them upon him. \"Just\r\nnow, I'm thinking of running on to New York for a few weeks,\" he ended\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\nOttenburg lifted his chin. \"Ah!\" he exclaimed, as if he began to see\r\nArchie's drift. \"Shall you see Thea?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\" The doctor replenished his cordial glass. \"In fact, I suspect I\r\nam going exactly TO see her. I'm getting stale on things here, Fred.\r\nBest people in the world and always doing things for me. I'm fond of\r\nthem, too, but I've been with them too much. I'm getting ill-tempered,\r\nand the first thing I know I'll be hurting people's feelings. I snapped\r\nMrs. Dandridge up over the telephone this afternoon when she asked me to\r\ngo out to Colorado Springs on Sunday to meet some English people who are\r\nstaying at the Antlers. Very nice of her to want me, and I was as sour\r\nas if she'd been trying to work me for something. I've got to get out\r\nfor a while, to save my reputation.\"\r\n\r\nTo this explanation Ottenburg had not paid much attention. He seemed to\r\nbe looking at a fixed point: the yellow glass eyes of a fine wildcat\r\nover one of the bookcases. \"You've never heard her at all, have you?\" he\r\nasked reflectively. \"Curious, when this is her second season in New\r\nYork.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was going on last March. Had everything arranged. And then old Cap\r\nHarris thought he could drive his car and me through a lamp-post and I\r\nwas laid up with a compound fracture for two months. So I didn't get to\r\nsee Thea.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg studied the red end of his cigarette attentively. \"She might\r\nhave come out to see you. I remember you covered the distance like a\r\nstreak when she wanted you.\"\r\n\r\nArchie moved uneasily. \"Oh, she couldn't do that. She had to get back to\r\nVienna to work on some new parts for this year. She sailed two days\r\nafter the New York season closed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then she couldn't, of course.\" Fred smoked his cigarette close\r\nand tossed the end into the fire. \"I'm tremendously glad you're going\r\nnow. If you're stale, she'll jack you up. That's one of her specialties.\r\nShe got a rise out of me last December that lasted me all winter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" the doctor apologized, \"you know so much more about such\r\nthings. I'm afraid it will be rather wasted on me. I'm no judge of\r\nmusic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind that.\" The younger man pulled himself up in his chair. \"She\r\ngets it across to people who aren't judges. That's just what she does.\"\r\nHe relapsed into his former lassitude. \"If you were stone deaf, it\r\nwouldn't all be wasted. It's a great deal to watch her. Incidentally,\r\nyou know, she is very beautiful. Photographs give you no idea.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie clasped his large hands under his chin. \"Oh, I'm counting on\r\nthat. I don't suppose her voice will sound natural to me. Probably I\r\nwouldn't know it.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg smiled. \"You'll know it, if you ever knew it. It's the same\r\nvoice, only more so. You'll know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you, in Germany that time, when you wrote me? Seven years ago, now.\r\nThat must have been at the very beginning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, somewhere near the beginning. She sang one of the Rhine\r\ndaughters.\" Fred paused and drew himself up again. \"Sure, I knew it from\r\nthe first note. I'd heard a good many young voices come up out of the\r\nRhine, but, by gracious, I hadn't heard one like that!\" He fumbled for\r\nanother cigarette. \"Mahler was conducting that night. I met him as he\r\nwas leaving the house and had a word with him. 'Interesting voice you\r\ntried out this evening,' I said. He stopped and smiled. 'Miss Kronborg,\r\nyou mean? Yes, very. She seems to sing for the idea. Unusual in a young\r\nsinger.' I'd never heard him admit before that a singer could have an\r\nidea. She not only had it, but she got it across. The Rhine music, that\r\nI'd known since I was a boy, was fresh to me, vocalized for the first\r\ntime. You realized that she was beginning that long story, adequately,\r\nwith the end in view. Every phrase she sang was basic. She simply WAS\r\nthe idea of the Rhine music.\" Ottenburg rose and stood with his back to\r\nthe fire. \"And at the end, where you don't see the maidens at all, the\r\nsame thing again: two pretty voices AND the Rhine voice.\" Fred snapped\r\nhis fingers and dropped his hand.\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked up at him enviously. \"You see, all that would be lost\r\non me,\" he said modestly. \"I don't know the dream nor the interpretation\r\nthereof. I'm out of it. It's too bad that so few of her old friends can\r\nappreciate her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take a try at it,\" Fred encouraged him. \"You'll get in deeper than you\r\ncan explain to yourself. People with no personal interest do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" said Archie diffidently, \"that college German, gone to\r\nseed, wouldn't help me out much. I used to be able to make my German\r\npatients understand me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure it would!\" cried Ottenburg heartily. \"Don't be above knowing your\r\nlibretto. That's all very well for musicians, but common mortals like\r\nyou and me have got to know what she's singing about. Get out your\r\ndictionary and go at it as you would at any other proposition. Her\r\ndiction is beautiful, and if you know the text you'll get a great deal.\r\nSo long as you're going to hear her, get all that's coming to you. You\r\nbet in Germany people know their librettos by heart! You Americans are\r\nso afraid of stooping to learn anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"I AM a little ashamed,\" Archie admitted. \"I guess that's the way we\r\nmask our general ignorance. However, I'll stoop this time; I'm more\r\nashamed not to be able to follow her. The papers always say she's such a\r\nfine actress.\" He took up the tongs and began to rearrange the logs that\r\nhad burned through and fallen apart. \"I suppose she has changed a great\r\ndeal?\" he asked absently.\r\n\r\n\"We've all changed, my dear Archie,--she more than most of us. Yes, and\r\nno. She's all there, only there's a great deal more of her. I've had\r\nonly a few words with her in several years. It's better not, when I'm\r\ntied up this way. The laws are barbarous, Archie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your wife is--still the same?\" the doctor asked sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely. Hasn't been out of a sanitarium for seven years now. No\r\nprospect of her ever being out, and as long as she's there I'm tied hand\r\nand foot. What does society get out of such a state of things, I'd like\r\nto know, except a tangle of irregularities? If you want to reform,\r\nthere's an opening for you!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's bad, oh, very bad; I agree with you!\" Dr. Archie shook his head.\r\n\"But there would be complications under another system, too. The whole\r\nquestion of a young man's marrying has looked pretty grave to me for a\r\nlong while. How have they the courage to keep on doing it? It depresses\r\nme now to buy wedding presents.\" For some time the doctor watched his\r\nguest, who was sunk in bitter reflections. \"Such things used to go\r\nbetter than they do now, I believe. Seems to me all the married people I\r\nknew when I was a boy were happy enough.\" He paused again and bit the\r\nend off a fresh cigar. \"You never saw Thea's mother, did you, Ottenburg?\r\nThat's a pity. Mrs. Kronborg was a fine woman. I've always been afraid\r\nThea made a mistake, not coming home when Mrs. Kronborg was ill, no\r\nmatter what it cost her.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg moved about restlessly. \"She couldn't, Archie, she positively\r\ncouldn't. I felt you never understood that, but I was in Dresden at the\r\ntime, and though I wasn't seeing much of her, I could size up the\r\nsituation for myself. It was by just a lucky chance that she got to sing\r\nELIZABETH that time at the Dresden Opera, a complication of\r\ncircumstances. If she'd run away, for any reason, she might have waited\r\nyears for such a chance to come again. She gave a wonderful performance\r\nand made a great impression. They offered her certain terms; she had to\r\ntake them and follow it up then and there. In that game you can't lose a\r\nsingle trick. She was ill herself, but she sang. Her mother was ill, and\r\nshe sang. No, you mustn't hold that against her, Archie. She did the\r\nright thing there.\" Ottenburg drew out his watch. \"Hello! I must be\r\ntraveling. You hear from her regularly?\"\r\n\r\n\"More or less regularly. She was never much of a letter-writer. She tells\r\nme about her engagements and contracts, but I know so little about that\r\nbusiness that it doesn't mean much to me beyond the figures, which seem\r\nvery impressive. We've had a good deal of business correspondence, about\r\nputting up a stone to her father and mother, and, lately, about her\r\nyoungest brother, Thor. He is with me now; he drives my car. To-day he's\r\nup at the mine.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg, who had picked up his overcoat, dropped it. \"Drives your\r\ncar?\" he asked incredulously.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Thea and I have had a good deal of bother about Thor. We tried a\r\nbusiness college, and an engineering school, but it was no good. Thor\r\nwas born a chauffeur before there were cars to drive. He was never good\r\nfor anything else; lay around home and collected postage stamps and took\r\nbicycles to pieces, waiting for the automobile to be invented. He's just\r\nas much a part of a car as the steering-gear. I can't find out whether\r\nhe likes his job with me or not, or whether he feels any curiosity about\r\nhis sister. You can't find anything out from a Kronborg nowadays. The\r\nmother was different.\"\r\n\r\nFred plunged into his coat. \"Well, it's a queer world, Archie. But\r\nyou'll think better of it, if you go to New York. Wish I were going with\r\nyou. I'll drop in on you in the morning at about eleven. I want a word\r\nwith you about this Interstate Commerce Bill. Good-night.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie saw his guest to the motor which was waiting below, and then\r\nwent back to his library, where he replenished the fire and sat down for\r\na long smoke. A man of Archie's modest and rather credulous nature\r\ndevelops late, and makes his largest gain between forty and fifty. At\r\nthirty, indeed, as we have seen, Archie was a soft-hearted boy under a\r\nmanly exterior, still whistling to keep up his courage. Prosperity and\r\nlarge responsibilities--above all, getting free of poor Mrs. Archie--had\r\nbrought out a good deal more than he knew was in him. He was thinking\r\ntonight as he sat before the fire, in the comfort he liked so well, that\r\nbut for lucky chances, and lucky holes in the ground, he would still be\r\na country practitioner, reading his old books by his office lamp. And\r\nyet, he was not so fresh and energetic as he ought to be. He was tired\r\nof business and of politics. Worse than that, he was tired of the men\r\nwith whom he had to do and of the women who, as he said, had been kind\r\nto him. He felt as if he were still hunting for something, like old\r\nJasper Flight. He knew that this was an unbecoming and ungrateful state\r\nof mind, and he reproached himself for it. But he could not help\r\nwondering why it was that life, even when it gave so much, after all\r\ngave so little. What was it that he had expected and missed? Why was he,\r\nmore than he was anything else, disappointed?\r\n\r\nHe fell to looking back over his life and asking himself which years of\r\nit he would like to live over again,--just as they had been,--and they\r\nwere not many. His college years he would live again, gladly. After them\r\nthere was nothing he would care to repeat until he came to Thea\r\nKronborg. There had been something stirring about those years in\r\nMoonstone, when he was a restless young man on the verge of breaking\r\ninto larger enterprises, and when she was a restless child on the verge\r\nof growing up into something unknown. He realized now that she had\r\ncounted for a great deal more to him than he knew at the time. It was a\r\ncontinuous sort of relationship. He was always on the lookout for her as\r\nhe went about the town, always vaguely expecting her as he sat in his\r\noffice at night. He had never asked himself then if it was strange that\r\nhe should find a child of twelve the most interesting and companionable\r\nperson in Moonstone. It had seemed a pleasant, natural kind of\r\nsolicitude. He explained it then by the fact that he had no children of\r\nhis own. But now, as he looked back at those years, the other interests\r\nwere faded and inanimate. The thought of them was heavy. But wherever\r\nhis life had touched Thea Kronborg's, there was still a little warmth\r\nleft, a little sparkle. Their friendship seemed to run over those\r\ndiscontented years like a leafy pattern, still bright and fresh when the\r\nother patterns had faded into the dull background. Their walks and\r\ndrives and confidences, the night they watched the rabbit in the\r\nmoonlight,--why were these things stirring to remember? Whenever he\r\nthought of them, they were distinctly different from the other memories\r\nof his life; always seemed humorous, gay, with a little thrill of\r\nanticipation and mystery about them. They came nearer to being tender\r\nsecrets than any others he possessed. Nearer than anything else they\r\ncorresponded to what he had hoped to find in the world, and had not\r\nfound. It came over him now that the unexpected favors of fortune, no\r\nmatter how dazzling, do not mean very much to us. They may excite or\r\ndivert us for a time, but when we look back, the only things we cherish\r\nare those which in some way met our original want; the desire which\r\nformed in us in early youth, undirected, and of its own accord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nFOR the first four years after Thea went to Germany things went on as\r\nusual with the Kronborg family. Mrs. Kronborg's land in Nebraska\r\nincreased in value and brought her in a good rental. The family drifted\r\ninto an easier way of living, half without realizing it, as families\r\nwill. Then Mr. Kronborg, who had never been ill, died suddenly of cancer\r\nof the liver, and after his death Mrs. Kronborg went, as her neighbors\r\nsaid, into a decline. Hearing discouraging reports of her from the\r\nphysician who had taken over his practice, Dr. Archie went up from\r\nDenver to see her. He found her in bed, in the room where he had more\r\nthan once attended her, a handsome woman of sixty with a body still firm\r\nand white, her hair, faded now to a very pale primrose, in two thick\r\nbraids down her back, her eyes clear and calm. When the doctor arrived,\r\nshe was sitting up in her bed, knitting. He felt at once how glad she\r\nwas to see him, but he soon gathered that she had made no determination\r\nto get well. She told him, indeed, that she could not very well get\r\nalong without Mr. Kronborg. The doctor looked at her with astonishment.\r\nWas it possible that she could miss the foolish old man so much? He\r\nreminded her of her children.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she replied; \"the children are all very well, but they are not\r\nfather. We were married young.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor watched her wonderingly as she went on knitting, thinking how\r\nmuch she looked like Thea. The difference was one of degree rather than\r\nof kind. The daughter had a compelling enthusiasm, the mother had none.\r\nBut their framework, their foundation, was very much the same.\r\n\r\nIn a moment Mrs. Kronborg spoke again. \"Have you heard anything from\r\nThea lately?\"\r\n\r\nDuring his talk with her, the doctor gathered that what Mrs. Kronborg\r\nreally wanted was to see her daughter Thea. Lying there day after day,\r\nshe wanted it calmly and continuously. He told her that, since she felt\r\nso, he thought they might ask Thea to come home.\r\n\r\n\"I've thought a good deal about it,\" said Mrs. Kronborg slowly. \"I hate\r\nto interrupt her, now that she's begun to get advancement. I expect\r\nshe's seen some pretty hard times, though she was never one to complain.\r\nPerhaps she'd feel that she would like to come. It would be hard, losing\r\nboth of us while she's off there.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Archie got back to Denver he wrote a long letter to Thea,\r\nexplaining her mother's condition and how much she wished to see her,\r\nand asking Thea to come, if only for a few weeks. Thea had repaid the\r\nmoney she had borrowed from him, and he assured her that if she happened\r\nto be short of funds for the journey, she had only to cable him.\r\n\r\nA month later he got a frantic sort of reply from Thea. Complications in\r\nthe opera at Dresden had given her an unhoped-for opportunity to go on\r\nin a big part. Before this letter reached the doctor, she would have\r\nmade her debut as ELIZABETH, in \"Tannhauser.\" She wanted to go to her\r\nmother more than she wanted anything else in the world, but, unless she\r\nfailed,--which she would not,--she absolutely could not leave Dresden\r\nfor six months. It was not that she chose to stay; she had to stay--or\r\nlose everything. The next few months would put her five years ahead, or\r\nwould put her back so far that it would be of no use to struggle\r\nfurther. As soon as she was free, she would go to Moonstone and take her\r\nmother back to Germany with her. Her mother, she was sure, could live\r\nfor years yet, and she would like German people and German ways, and\r\ncould be hearing music all the time. Thea said she was writing her\r\nmother and begging her to help her one last time; to get strength and to\r\nwait for her six months, and then she (Thea) would do everything. Her\r\nmother would never have to make an effort again.\r\n\r\nDr. Archie went up to Moonstone at once. He had great confidence in Mrs.\r\nKronborg's power of will, and if Thea's appeal took hold of her enough,\r\nhe believed she might get better. But when he was shown into the\r\nfamiliar room off the parlor, his heart sank. Mrs. Kronborg was lying\r\nserene and fateful on her pillows. On the dresser at the foot of her bed\r\nthere was a large photograph of Thea in the character in which she was\r\nto make her debut. Mrs. Kronborg pointed to it.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't she lovely, doctor? It's nice that she hasn't changed much. I've\r\nseen her look like that many a time.\"\r\n\r\nThey talked for a while about Thea's good fortune. Mrs. Kronborg had had\r\na cablegram saying, \"First performance well received. Great relief.\" In\r\nher letter Thea said; \"If you'll only get better, dear mother, there's\r\nnothing I can't do. I will make a really great success, if you'll try\r\nwith me. You shall have everything you want, and we will always be\r\ntogether. I have a little house all picked out where we are to live.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bringing up a family is not all it's cracked up to be,\" said Mrs.\r\nKronborg with a flicker of irony, as she tucked the letter back under\r\nher pillow. \"The children you don't especially need, you have always\r\nwith you, like the poor. But the bright ones get away from you. They\r\nhave their own way to make in the world. Seems like the brighter they\r\nare, the farther they go. I used to feel sorry that you had no family,\r\ndoctor, but maybe you're as well off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thea's plan seems sound to me, Mrs. Kronborg. There's no reason I can\r\nsee why you shouldn't pull up and live for years yet, under proper care.\r\nYou'd have the best doctors in the world over there, and it would be\r\nwonderful to live with anybody who looks like that.\" He nodded at the\r\nphotograph of the young woman who must have been singing \"DICH, THEURE\r\nHALLE, GRUSS' ICH WIEDER,\" her eyes looking up, her beautiful hands\r\noutspread with pleasure.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kronborg laughed quite cheerfully. \"Yes, wouldn't it? If father\r\nwere here, I might rouse myself. But sometimes it's hard to come back.\r\nOr if she were in trouble, maybe I could rouse myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, dear Mrs. Kronborg, she is in trouble,\" her old friend\r\nexpostulated. \"As she says, she's never needed you as she needs you now.\r\nI make my guess that she's never begged anybody to help her before.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Kronborg smiled. \"Yes, it's pretty of her. But that will pass. When\r\nthese things happen far away they don't make such a mark; especially if\r\nyour hands are full and you've duties of your own to think about. My own\r\nfather died in Nebraska when Gunner was born,--we were living in Iowa\r\nthen,--and I was sorry, but the baby made it up to me. I was father's\r\nfavorite, too. That's the way it goes, you see.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor took out Thea's letter to him, and read it over to Mrs.\r\nKronborg. She seemed to listen, and not to listen.\r\n\r\nWhen he finished, she said thoughtfully: \"I'd counted on hearing her\r\nsing again. But I always took my pleasures as they come. I always\r\nenjoyed her singing when she was here about the house. While she was\r\npracticing I often used to leave my work and sit down in a rocker and\r\ngive myself up to it, the same as if I'd been at an entertainment. I was\r\nnever one of these housekeepers that let their work drive them to death.\r\nAnd when she had the Mexicans over here, I always took it in. First and\r\nlast,\"--she glanced judicially at the photograph,--\"I guess I got about\r\nas much out of Thea's voice as anybody will ever get.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess you did!\" the doctor assented heartily; \"and I got a good deal\r\nmyself. You remember how she used to sing those Scotch songs for me, and\r\nlead us with her head, her hair bobbing?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Flow Gently, Sweet Afton,'--I can hear it now,\" said Mrs. Kronborg;\r\n\"and poor father never knew when he sang sharp! He used to say, 'Mother,\r\nhow do you always know when they make mistakes practicing?'\" Mrs.\r\nKronborg chuckled.\r\n\r\nDr. Archie took her hand, still firm like the hand of a young woman. \"It\r\nwas lucky for her that you did know. I always thought she got more from\r\nyou than from any of her teachers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Except Wunsch; he was a real musician,\" said Mrs. Kronborg\r\nrespectfully. \"I gave her what chance I could, in a crowded house. I\r\nkept the other children out of the parlor for her. That was about all I\r\ncould do. If she wasn't disturbed, she needed no watching. She went\r\nafter it like a terrier after rats from the first, poor child. She was\r\ndownright afraid of it. That's why I always encouraged her taking Thor\r\noff to outlandish places. When she was out of the house, then she was\r\nrid of it.\"\r\n\r\nAfter they had recalled many pleasant memories together, Mrs. Kronborg\r\nsaid suddenly: \"I always understood about her going off without coming\r\nto see us that time. Oh, I know! You had to keep your own counsel. You\r\nwere a good friend to her. I've never forgot that.\" She patted the\r\ndoctor's sleeve and went on absently. \"There was something she didn't\r\nwant to tell me, and that's why she didn't come. Something happened when\r\nshe was with those people in Mexico. I worried for a good while, but I\r\nguess she's come out of it all right. She'd had a pretty hard time,\r\nscratching along alone like that when she was so young, and my farms in\r\nNebraska were down so low that I couldn't help her none. That's no way\r\nto send a girl out. But I guess, whatever there was, she wouldn't be\r\nafraid to tell me now.\" Mrs. Kronborg looked up at the photograph with a\r\nsmile. \"She doesn't look like she was beholding to anybody, does she?\"\r\n\r\n\"She isn't, Mrs. Kronborg. She never has been. That was why she borrowed\r\nthe money from me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I knew she'd never have sent for you if she'd done anything to\r\nshame us. She was always proud.\" Mrs. Kronborg paused and turned a\r\nlittle on her side. \"It's been quite a satisfaction to you and me,\r\ndoctor, having her voice turn out so fine. The things you hope for don't\r\nalways turn out like that, by a long sight. As long as old Mrs. Kohler\r\nlived, she used always to translate what it said about Thea in the\r\nGerman papers she sent. I could make some of it out myself,--it's not\r\nvery different from Swedish,--but it pleased the old lady. She left Thea\r\nher piece-picture of the burning of Moscow. I've got it put away in\r\nmoth-balls for her, along with the oboe her grandfather brought from\r\nSweden. I want her to take father's oboe back there some day.\" Mrs.\r\nKronborg paused a moment and compressed her lips. \"But I guess she'll\r\ntake a finer instrument than that with her, back to Sweden!\" she added.\r\n\r\nHer tone fairly startled the doctor, it was so vibrating with a fierce,\r\ndefiant kind of pride he had heard often in Thea's voice. He looked down\r\nwonderingly at his old friend and patient. After all, one never knew\r\npeople to the core. Did she, within her, hide some of that still passion\r\nof which her daughter was all-compact?\r\n\r\n\"That last summer at home wasn't very nice for her,\" Mrs. Kronborg began\r\nas placidly as if the fire had never leaped up in her. \"The other\r\nchildren were acting-up because they thought I might make a fuss over\r\nher and give her the big-head. We gave her the dare, somehow, the lot of\r\nus, because we couldn't understand her changing teachers and all that.\r\nThat's the trouble about giving the dare to them quiet, unboastful\r\nchildren; you never know how far it'll take 'em. Well, we ought not to\r\ncomplain, doctor; she's given us a good deal to think about.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next time Dr. Archie came to Moonstone, he came to be a pall-bearer\r\nat Mrs. Kronborg's funeral. When he last looked at her, she was so\r\nserene and queenly that he went back to Denver feeling almost as if he\r\nhad helped to bury Thea Kronborg herself. The handsome head in the\r\ncoffin seemed to him much more really Thea than did the radiant young\r\nwoman in the picture, looking about at the Gothic vaultings and greeting\r\nthe Hall of Song.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nONE bright morning late in February Dr. Archie was breakfasting\r\ncomfortably at the Waldorf. He had got into Jersey City on an early\r\ntrain, and a red, windy sunrise over the North River had given him a\r\ngood appetite. He consulted the morning paper while he drank his coffee\r\nand saw that \"Lohengrin\" was to be sung at the opera that evening. In\r\nthe list of the artists who would appear was the name \"Kronborg.\" Such\r\nabruptness rather startled him. \"Kronborg\": it was impressive and yet,\r\nsomehow, disrespectful; somewhat rude and brazen, on the back page of\r\nthe morning paper. After breakfast he went to the hotel ticket office\r\nand asked the girl if she could give him something for \"Lohengrin,\"\r\n\"near the front.\" His manner was a trifle awkward and he wondered\r\nwhether the girl noticed it. Even if she did, of course, she could\r\nscarcely suspect. Before the ticket stand he saw a bunch of blue posters\r\nannouncing the opera casts for the week. There was \"Lohengrin,\" and\r\nunder it he saw:--\r\n\r\n\r\nELSA VON BRABANT...Thea Kronborg.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat looked better. The girl gave him a ticket for a seat which she said\r\nwas excellent. He paid for it and went out to the cabstand. He mentioned\r\nto the driver a number on Riverside Drive and got into a taxi. It would\r\nnot, of course, be the right thing to call upon Thea when she was going\r\nto sing in the evening. He knew that much, thank goodness! Fred\r\nOttenburg had hinted to him that, more than almost anything else, that\r\nwould put one in wrong.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the number to which he directed his letters, he\r\ndismissed the cab and got out for a walk. The house in which Thea lived\r\nwas as impersonal as the Waldorf, and quite as large. It was above 116th\r\nStreet, where the Drive narrows, and in front of it the shelving bank\r\ndropped to the North River. As Archie strolled about the paths which\r\ntraversed this slope, below the street level, the fourteen stories of\r\nthe apartment hotel rose above him like a perpendicular cliff. He had no\r\nidea on which floor Thea lived, but he reflected, as his eye ran over\r\nthe many windows, that the outlook would be fine from any floor. The\r\nforbidding hugeness of the house made him feel as if he had expected to\r\nmeet Thea in a crowd and had missed her. He did not really believe that\r\nshe was hidden away behind any of those glittering windows, or that he\r\nwas to hear her this evening. His walk was curiously uninspiring and\r\nunsuggestive. Presently remembering that Ottenburg had encouraged him to\r\nstudy his lesson, he went down to the opera house and bought a libretto.\r\nHe had even brought his old \"Adler's German and English\" in his trunk,\r\nand after luncheon he settled down in his gilded suite at the Waldorf\r\nwith a big cigar and the text of \"Lohengrin.\"\r\n\r\nThe opera was announced for seven-forty-five, but at half-past seven\r\nArchie took his seat in the right front of the orchestra circle. He had\r\nnever been inside the Metropolitan Opera House before, and the height of\r\nthe audience room, the rich color, and the sweep of the balconies were\r\nnot without their effect upon him. He watched the house fill with a\r\ngrowing feeling of expectation. When the steel curtain rose and the men\r\nof the orchestra took their places, he felt distinctly nervous. The\r\nburst of applause which greeted the conductor keyed him still higher. He\r\nfound that he had taken off his gloves and twisted them to a string.\r\nWhen the lights went down and the violins began the overture, the place\r\nlooked larger than ever; a great pit, shadowy and solemn. The whole\r\natmosphere, he reflected, was somehow more serious than he had\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\nAfter the curtains were drawn back upon the scene beside the Scheldt, he\r\ngot readily into the swing of the story. He was so much interested in\r\nthe bass who sang KING HENRY that he had almost forgotten for what he\r\nwas waiting so nervously, when the HERALD began in stentorian tones to\r\nsummon ELSA VON BRABANT. Then he began to realize that he was rather\r\nfrightened. There was a flutter of white at the back of the stage, and\r\nwomen began to come in: two, four, six, eight, but not the right one. It\r\nflashed across him that this was something like buck-fever, the\r\nparalyzing moment that comes upon a man when his first elk looks at him\r\nthrough the bushes, under its great antlers; the moment when a man's\r\nmind is so full of shooting that he forgets the gun in his hand until\r\nthe buck nods adieu to him from a distant hill.\r\n\r\nAll at once, before the buck had left him, she was there. Yes,\r\nunquestionably it was she. Her eyes were downcast, but the head, the\r\ncheeks, the chin--there could be no mistake; she advanced slowly, as if\r\nshe were walking in her sleep. Some one spoke to her; she only inclined\r\nher head. He spoke again, and she bowed her head still lower. Archie had\r\nforgotten his libretto, and he had not counted upon these long pauses.\r\nHe had expected her to appear and sing and reassure him. They seemed to\r\nbe waiting for her. Did she ever forget? Why in thunder didn't she--She\r\nmade a sound, a faint one. The people on the stage whispered together\r\nand seemed confounded. His nervousness was absurd. She must have done\r\nthis often before; she knew her bearings. She made another sound, but he\r\ncould make nothing of it. Then the King sang to her, and Archie began to\r\nremember where they were in the story. She came to the front of the\r\nstage, lifted her eyes for the first time, clasped her hands and began,\r\n\"EINSAM IN TRUBEN TAGEN.\"\r\n\r\nYes, it was exactly like buck-fever. Her face was there, toward the\r\nhouse now, before his eyes, and he positively could not see it. She was\r\nsinging, at last, and he positively could not hear her. He was conscious\r\nof nothing but an uncomfortable dread and a sense of crushing\r\ndisappointment. He had, after all, missed her. Whatever was there, she\r\nwas not there--for him.\r\n\r\nThe King interrupted her. She began again, \"IN LICHTER WAFFEN SCHEINE.\"\r\nArchie did not know when his buckfever passed, but presently he found\r\nthat he was sitting quietly in a darkened house, not listening to but\r\ndreaming upon a river of silver sound. He felt apart from the others,\r\ndrifting alone on the melody, as if he had been alone with it for a long\r\nwhile and had known it all before. His power of attention was not great\r\njust then, but in so far as it went he seemed to be looking through an\r\nexalted calmness at a beautiful woman from far away, from another sort\r\nof life and feeling and understanding than his own, who had in her face\r\nsomething he had known long ago, much brightened and beautified. As a\r\nlad he used to believe that the faces of people who died were like that\r\nin the next world; the same faces, but shining with the light of a new\r\nunderstanding. No, Ottenburg had not prepared him!\r\n\r\nWhat he felt was admiration and estrangement. The homely reunion, that\r\nhe had somehow expected, now seemed foolish. Instead of feeling proud\r\nthat he knew her better than all these people about him, he felt\r\nchagrined at his own ingenuousness. For he did not know her better. This\r\nwoman he had never known; she had somehow devoured his little friend, as\r\nthe wolf ate up Red Ridinghood. Beautiful, radiant, tender as she was,\r\nshe chilled his old affection; that sort of feeling was not appropriate.\r\nShe seemed much, much farther away from him than she had seemed all\r\nthose years when she was in Germany. The ocean he could cross, but there\r\nwas something here he could not cross. There was a moment, when she\r\nturned to the King and smiled that rare, sunrise smile of her childhood,\r\nwhen he thought she was coming back to him. After the HERALD'S second\r\ncall for her champion, when she knelt in her impassioned prayer, there\r\nwas again something familiar, a kind of wild wonder that she had had the\r\npower to call up long ago. But she merely reminded him of Thea; this was\r\nnot the girl herself.\r\n\r\nAfter the tenor came on, the doctor ceased trying to make the woman\r\nbefore him fit into any of his cherished recollections. He took her, in\r\nso far as he could, for what she was then and there. When the knight\r\nraised the kneeling girl and put his mailed hand on her hair, when she\r\nlifted to him a face full of worship and passionate humility, Archie\r\ngave up his last reservation. He knew no more about her than did the\r\nhundreds around him, who sat in the shadow and looked on, as he looked,\r\nsome with more understanding, some with less. He knew as much about\r\nORTRUDE or LOHENGRIN as he knew about ELSA--more, because she went\r\nfurther than they, she sustained the legendary beauty of her conception\r\nmore consistently. Even he could see that. Attitudes, movements, her\r\nface, her white arms and fingers, everything was suffused with a rosy\r\ntenderness, a warm humility, a gracious and yet--to him--wholly\r\nestranging beauty.\r\n\r\nDuring the balcony singing in the second act the doctor's thoughts were\r\nas far away from Moonstone as the singer's doubtless were. He had begun,\r\nindeed, to feel the exhilaration of getting free from personalities, of\r\nbeing released from his own past as well as from Thea Kronborg's. It was\r\nvery much, he told himself, like a military funeral, exalting and\r\nimpersonal. Something old died in one, and out of it something new was\r\nborn. During the duet with ORTRUDE, and the splendors of the wedding\r\nprocessional, this new feeling grew and grew. At the end of the act\r\nthere were many curtain calls and ELSA acknowledged them, brilliant,\r\ngracious, spirited, with her far-breaking smile; but on the whole she\r\nwas harder and more self-contained before the curtain than she was in\r\nthe scene behind it. Archie did his part in the applause that greeted\r\nher, but it was the new and wonderful he applauded, not the old and\r\ndear. His personal, proprietary pride in her was frozen out.\r\n\r\nHe walked about the house during the ENTR'ACTE, and here and there among\r\nthe people in the foyer he caught the name \"Kronborg.\" On the staircase,\r\nin front of the coffeeroom, a long-haired youth with a fat face was\r\ndiscoursing to a group of old women about \"die Kronborg.\" Dr. Archie\r\ngathered that he had crossed on the boat with her.\r\n\r\nAfter the performance was over, Archie took a taxi and started for\r\nRiverside Drive. He meant to see it through to-night. When he entered\r\nthe reception hall of the hotel before which he had strolled that\r\nmorning, the hall porter challenged him. He said he was waiting for Miss\r\nKronborg. The porter looked at him suspiciously and asked whether he had\r\nan appointment. He answered brazenly that he had. He was not used to\r\nbeing questioned by hall boys. Archie sat first in one tapestry chair\r\nand then in another, keeping a sharp eye on the people who came in and\r\nwent up in the elevators. He walked about and looked at his watch. An\r\nhour dragged by. No one had come in from the street now for about twenty\r\nminutes, when two women entered, carrying a great many flowers and\r\nfollowed by a tall young man in chauffeur's uniform. Archie advanced\r\ntoward the taller of the two women, who was veiled and carried her head\r\nvery firmly. He confronted her just as she reached the elevator.\r\nAlthough he did not stand directly in her way, something in his attitude\r\ncompelled her to stop. She gave him a piercing, defiant glance through\r\nthe white scarf that covered her face. Then she lifted her hand and\r\nbrushed the scarf back from her head. There was still black on her brows\r\nand lashes. She was very pale and her face was drawn and deeply lined.\r\nShe looked, the doctor told himself with a sinking heart, forty years\r\nold. Her suspicious, mystified stare cleared slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me,\" the doctor murmured, not knowing just how to address her\r\nhere before the porters, \"I came up from the opera. I merely wanted to\r\nsay good-night to you.\"\r\n\r\nWithout speaking, still looking incredulous, she pushed him into the\r\nelevator. She kept her hand on his arm while the cage shot up, and she\r\nlooked away from him, frowning, as if she were trying to remember or\r\nrealize something. When the cage stopped, she pushed him out of the\r\nelevator through another door, which a maid opened, into a square hall.\r\nThere she sank down on a chair and looked up at him.\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you let me know?\" she asked in a hoarse voice.\r\n\r\nArchie heard himself laughing the old, embarrassed laugh that seldom\r\nhappened to him now. \"Oh, I wanted to take my chance with you, like\r\nanybody else. It's been so long, now!\"\r\n\r\nShe took his hand through her thick glove and her head dropped forward.\r\n\"Yes, it has been long,\" she said in the same husky voice, \"and so much\r\nhas happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are so tired, and I am a clumsy old fellow to break in on you\r\nto-night,\" the doctor added sympathetically. \"Forgive me, this time.\" He\r\nbent over and put his hand soothingly on her shoulder. He felt a strong\r\nshudder run through her from head to foot.\r\n\r\nStill bundled in her fur coat as she was, she threw both arms about him\r\nand hugged him. \"Oh, Dr. Archie, DR. ARCHIE,\"--she shook him,--\"don't\r\nlet me go. Hold on, now you're here,\" she laughed, breaking away from\r\nhim at the same moment and sliding out of her fur coat. She left it for\r\nthe maid to pick up and pushed the doctor into the sitting-room, where\r\nshe turned on the lights. \"Let me LOOK at you. Yes; hands, feet, head,\r\nshoulders--just the same. You've grown no older. You can't say as much\r\nfor me, can you?\"\r\n\r\nShe was standing in the middle of the room, in a white silk shirtwaist\r\nand a short black velvet skirt, which somehow suggested that they had\r\n'cut off her petticoats all round about.' She looked distinctly clipped\r\nand plucked. Her hair was parted in the middle and done very close to\r\nher head, as she had worn it under the wig. She looked like a fugitive,\r\nwho had escaped from something in clothes caught up at hazard. It\r\nflashed across Dr. Archie that she was running away from the other woman\r\ndown at the opera house, who had used her hardly.\r\n\r\nHe took a step toward her. \"I can't tell a thing in the world about you,\r\nThea--if I may still call you that.\"\r\n\r\nShe took hold of the collar of his overcoat. \"Yes, call me that. Do: I\r\nlike to hear it. You frighten me a little, but I expect I frighten you\r\nmore. I'm always a scarecrow after I sing a long part like that--so\r\nhigh, too.\" She absently pulled out the handkerchief that protruded from\r\nhis breast pocket and began to wipe the black paint off her eyebrows and\r\nlashes. \"I can't take you in much to-night, but I must see you for a\r\nlittle while.\" She pushed him to a chair. \"I shall be more recognizable\r\nto-morrow. You mustn't think of me as you see me to-night. Come at four\r\nto-morrow afternoon and have tea with me. Can you? That's good.\"\r\n\r\nShe sat down in a low chair beside him and leaned forward, drawing her\r\nshoulders together. She seemed to him inappropriately young and\r\ninappropriately old, shorn of her long tresses at one end and of her\r\nlong robes at the other.\r\n\r\n\"How do you happen to be here?\" she asked abruptly. \"How can you leave a\r\nsilver mine? I couldn't! Sure nobody'll cheat you? But you can explain\r\neverything tomorrow.\" She paused. \"You remember how you sewed me up in a\r\npoultice, once? I wish you could to-night. I need a poultice, from top\r\nto toe. Something very disagreeable happened down there. You said you\r\nwere out front? Oh, don't say anything about it. I always know exactly\r\nhow it goes, unfortunately. I was rotten in the balcony. I never get\r\nthat. You didn't notice it? Probably not, but I did.\"\r\n\r\nHere the maid appeared at the door and her mistress rose. \"My supper?\r\nVery well, I'll come. I'd ask you to stay, doctor, but there wouldn't be\r\nenough for two. They seldom send up enough for one,\"--she spoke\r\nbitterly. \"I haven't got a sense of you yet,\"--turning directly to\r\nArchie again. \"You haven't been here. You've only announced yourself,\r\nand told me you are coming to-morrow. You haven't seen me, either. This\r\nis not I. But I'll be here waiting for you to-morrow, my whole works!\r\nGoodnight, till then.\" She patted him absently on the sleeve and gave\r\nhim a little shove toward the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nWHEN Archie got back to his hotel at two o'clock in the morning, he\r\nfound Fred Ottenburg's card under his door, with a message scribbled\r\nacross the top: \"When you come in, please call up room 811, this hotel.\"\r\nA moment later Fred's voice reached him over the telephone.\r\n\r\n\"That you, Archie? Won't you come up? I'm having some supper and I'd\r\nlike company. Late? What does that matter? I won't keep you long.\"\r\n\r\nArchie dropped his overcoat and set out for room 811. He found Ottenburg\r\nin the act of touching a match to a chafing-dish, at a table laid for\r\ntwo in his sitting-room. \"I'm catering here,\" he announced cheerfully.\r\n\"I let the waiter off at midnight, after he'd set me up. You'll have to\r\naccount for yourself, Archie.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor laughed, pointing to three wine-coolers under the table. \"Are\r\nyou expecting guests?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, two.\" Ottenburg held up two fingers,--\"you, and my higher self.\r\nHe's a thirsty boy, and I don't invite him often. He has been known to\r\ngive me a headache. Now, where have you been, Archie, until this\r\nshocking hour?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah, you've been banting!\" the doctor exclaimed, pulling out his white\r\ngloves as he searched for his handkerchief and throwing them into a\r\nchair. Ottenburg was in evening clothes and very pointed dress shoes.\r\nHis white waistcoat, upon which the doctor had fixed a challenging eye,\r\nwent down straight from the top button, and he wore a camelia. He was\r\nconspicuously brushed and trimmed and polished. His smoothly controlled\r\nexcitement was wholly different from his usual easy cordiality, though\r\nhe had his face, as well as his figure, well in hand. On the\r\nserving-table there was an empty champagne pint and a glass. He had been\r\nhaving a little starter, the doctor told himself, and would probably be\r\nrunning on high gear before he got through. There was even now an air of\r\nspeed about him.\r\n\r\n\"Been, Freddy?\"--the doctor at last took up his question. \"I expect I've\r\nbeen exactly where you have. Why didn't you tell me you were coming on?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't, Archie.\" Fred lifted the cover of the chafingdish and stirred\r\nthe contents. He stood behind the table, holding the lid with his\r\nhandkerchief. \"I had never thought of such a thing. But Landry, a young\r\nchap who plays her accompaniments and who keeps an eye out for me,\r\ntelegraphed me that Madame Rheinecker had gone to Atlantic City with a\r\nbad throat, and Thea might have a chance to sing ELSA. She has sung it\r\nonly twice here before, and I missed it in Dresden. So I came on. I got\r\nin at four this afternoon and saw you registered, but I thought I wouldn't\r\nbutt in. How lucky you got here just when she was coming on for\r\nthis. You couldn't have hit a better time.\" Ottenburg stirred the\r\ncontents of the dish faster and put in more sherry. \"And where have you\r\nbeen since twelve o'clock, may I ask?\"\r\n\r\nArchie looked rather self-conscious, as he sat down on a fragile gilt\r\nchair that rocked under him, and stretched out his long legs. \"Well, if\r\nyou'll believe me, I had the brutality to go to see her. I wanted to\r\nidentify her. Couldn't wait.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg placed the cover quickly on the chafing-dish and took a step\r\nbackward. \"You did, old sport? My word! None but the brave deserve the\r\nfair. Well,\"--he stooped to turn the wine,--\"and how was she?\"\r\n\r\n\"She seemed rather dazed, and pretty well used up. She seemed\r\ndisappointed in herself, and said she hadn't done herself justice in the\r\nbalcony scene.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if she didn't, she's not the first. Beastly stuff to sing right\r\nin there; lies just on the 'break' in the voice.\" Fred pulled a bottle\r\nout of the ice and drew the cork. Lifting his glass he looked meaningly\r\nat Archie. \"You know who, doctor. Here goes!\" He drank off his glass\r\nwith a sigh of satisfaction. After he had turned the lamp low under the\r\nchafing-dish, he remained standing, looking pensively down at the food\r\non the table. \"Well, she rather pulled it off! As a backer, you're a\r\nwinner, Archie. I congratulate you.\" Fred poured himself another glass.\r\n\"Now you must eat something, and so must I. Here, get off that bird cage\r\nand find a steady chair. This stuff ought to be rather good; head\r\nwaiter's suggestion. Smells all right.\" He bent over the chafing-dish\r\nand began to serve the contents. \"Perfectly innocuous: mushrooms and\r\ntruffles and a little crab-meat. And now, on the level, Archie, how did\r\nit hit you?\"\r\n\r\nArchie turned a frank smile to his friend and shook his head. \"It was\r\nall miles beyond me, of course, but it gave me a pulse. The general\r\nexcitement got hold of me, I suppose. I like your wine, Freddy.\" He put\r\ndown his glass. \"It goes to the spot to-night. She WAS all right, then?\r\nYou weren't disappointed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Disappointed? My dear Archie, that's the high voice we dream of; so\r\npure and yet so virile and human. That combination hardly ever happens\r\nwith sopranos.\" Ottenburg sat down and turned to the doctor, speaking\r\ncalmly and trying to dispel his friend's manifest bewilderment. \"You\r\nsee, Archie, there's the voice itself, so beautiful and individual, and\r\nthen there's something else; the thing in it which responds to every\r\nshade of thought and feeling, spontaneously, almost unconsciously. That\r\ncolor has to be born in a singer, it can't be acquired; lots of\r\nbeautiful voices haven't a vestige of it. It's almost like another\r\ngift--the rarest of all. The voice simply is the mind and is the heart.\r\nIt can't go wrong in interpretation, because it has in it the thing that\r\nmakes all interpretation. That's why you feel so sure of her. After\r\nyou've listened to her for an hour or so, you aren't afraid of anything.\r\nAll the little dreads you have with other artists vanish. You lean back\r\nand you say to yourself, 'No, THAT voice will never betray.' TREULICH\r\nGEFUHRT, TREULICH BEWACHT.\"\r\n\r\nArchie looked envyingly at Fred's excited, triumphant face. How\r\nsatisfactory it must be, he thought, to really know what she was doing\r\nand not to have to take it on hearsay. He took up his glass with a sigh.\r\n\"I seem to need a good deal of cooling off to-night. I'd just as lief\r\nforget the Reform Party for once.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Fred,\" he went on seriously; \"I thought it sounded very beautiful,\r\nand I thought she was very beautiful, too. I never imagined she could be\r\nas beautiful as that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wasn't she? Every attitude a picture, and always the right kind of\r\npicture, full of that legendary, supernatural thing she gets into it. I\r\nnever heard the prayer sung like that before. That look that came in her\r\neyes; it went right out through the back of the roof. Of course, you get\r\nan ELSA who can look through walls like that, and visions and\r\nGrail-knights happen naturally. She becomes an abbess, that girl, after\r\nLOHENGRIN leaves her. She's made to live with ideas and enthusiasms, not\r\nwith a husband.\" Fred folded his arms, leaned back in his chair, and\r\nbegan to sing softly:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ein Ritter nahte da.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't she die, then, at the end?\" the doctor asked guardedly.\r\n\r\nFred smiled, reaching under the table. \"Some ELSAS do; she didn't. She\r\nleft me with the distinct impression that she was just beginning. Now,\r\ndoctor, here's a cold one.\" He twirled a napkin smoothly about the green\r\nglass, the cork gave and slipped out with a soft explosion. \"And now we\r\nmust have another toast. It's up to you, this time.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor watched the agitation in his glass. \"The same,\" he said\r\nwithout lifting his eyes. \"That's good enough. I can't raise you.\"\r\n\r\nFred leaned forward, and looked sharply into his face. \"That's the\r\npoint; how COULD you raise me? Once again!\"\r\n\r\n\"Once again, and always the same!\" The doctor put down his glass. \"This\r\ndoesn't seem to produce any symptoms in me to-night.\" He lit a cigar.\r\n\"Seriously, Freddy, I wish I knew more about what she's driving at. It\r\nmakes me jealous, when you are so in it and I'm not.\"\r\n\r\n\"In it?\" Fred started up. \"My God, haven't you seen her this blessed\r\nnight?--when she'd have kicked any other man down the elevator shaft, if\r\nI know her. Leave me something; at least what I can pay my five bucks\r\nfor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seems to me you get a good deal for your five bucks,\" said Archie\r\nruefully. \"And that, after all, is what she cares about,--what people\r\nget.\"\r\n\r\nFred lit a cigarette, took a puff or two, and then threw it away. He was\r\nlounging back in his chair, and his face was pale and drawn hard by that\r\nmood of intense concentration which lurks under the sunny shallows of\r\nthe vineyard. In his voice there was a longer perspective than usual, a\r\nslight remoteness. \"You see, Archie, it's all very simple, a natural\r\ndevelopment. It's exactly what Mahler said back there in the beginning,\r\nwhen she sang WOGLINDE. It's the idea, the basic idea, pulsing behind\r\nevery bar she sings. She simplifies a character down to the musical idea\r\nit's built on, and makes everything conform to that. The people who\r\nchatter about her being a great actress don't seem to get the notion of\r\nwhere SHE gets the notion. It all goes back to her original endowment,\r\nher tremendous musical talent. Instead of inventing a lot of business\r\nand expedients to suggest character, she knows the thing at the root,\r\nand lets the musical pattern take care of her. The score pours her into\r\nall those lovely postures, makes the light and shadow go over her face,\r\nlifts her and drops her. She lies on it, the way she used to lie on the\r\nRhine music. Talk about rhythm!\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor frowned dubiously as a third bottle made its appearance above\r\nthe cloth. \"Aren't you going in rather strong?\"\r\n\r\nFred laughed. \"No, I'm becoming too sober. You see this is breakfast\r\nnow; kind of wedding breakfast. I feel rather weddingish. I don't mind.\r\nYou know,\" he went on as the wine gurgled out, \"I was thinking to-night\r\nwhen they sprung the wedding music, how any fool can have that stuff\r\nplayed over him when he walks up the aisle with some dough-faced little\r\nhussy who's hooked him. But it isn't every fellow who can see--well,\r\nwhat we saw tonight. There are compensations in life, Dr. Howard Archie,\r\nthough they come in disguise. Did you notice her when she came down the\r\nstairs? Wonder where she gets that bright-and-morning star look? Carries\r\nto the last row of the family circle. I moved about all over the house.\r\nI'll tell you a secret, Archie: that carrying power was one of the first\r\nthings that put me wise. Noticed it down there in Arizona, in the open.\r\nThat, I said, belongs only to the big ones.\" Fred got up and began to\r\nmove rhythmically about the room, his hands in his pockets. The doctor\r\nwas astonished at his ease and steadiness, for there were slight lapses\r\nin his speech. \"You see, Archie, ELSA isn't a part that's particularly\r\nsuited to Thea's voice at all, as I see her voice. It's over-lyrical for\r\nher. She makes it, but there's nothing in it that fits her like a glove,\r\nexcept, maybe, that long duet in the third act. There, of course,\"--he\r\nheld out his hands as if he were measuring something,--\"we know exactly\r\nwhere we are. But wait until they give her a chance at something that\r\nlies properly in her voice, and you'll see me rosier than I am\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\nArchie smoothed the tablecloth with his hand. \"I am sure I don't want to\r\nsee you any rosier, Fred.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg threw back his head and laughed. \"It's enthusiasm, doctor.\r\nIt's not the wine. I've got as much inflated as this for a dozen trashy\r\nthings: brewers' dinners and political orgies. You, too, have your\r\nextravagances, Archie. And what I like best in you is this particular\r\nenthusiasm, which is not at all practical or sensible, which is\r\ndownright Quixotic. You are not altogether what you seem, and you have\r\nyour reservations. Living among the wolves, you have not become one.\r\nLUPIBUS VIVENDI NON LUPUS SUM.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor seemed embarrassed. \"I was just thinking how tired she\r\nlooked, plucked of all her fine feathers, while we get all the fun.\r\nInstead of sitting here carousing, we ought to go solemnly to bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I get your idea.\" Ottenburg crossed to the window and threw it open.\r\n\"Fine night outside; a hag of a moon just setting. It begins to smell\r\nlike morning. After all, Archie, think of the lonely and rather solemn\r\nhours we've spent waiting for all this, while she's been--reveling.\"\r\n\r\nArchie lifted his brows. \"I somehow didn't get the idea to-night that\r\nshe revels much.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean this sort of thing.\" Fred turned toward the light and\r\nstood with his back to the window. \"That,\" with a nod toward the\r\nwine-cooler, \"is only a cheap imitation, that any poor stiff-fingered\r\nfool can buy and feel his shell grow thinner. But take it from me, no\r\nmatter what she pays, or how much she may see fit to lie about it, the\r\nreal, the master revel is hers.\" He leaned back against the window sill\r\nand crossed his arms. \"Anybody with all that voice and all that talent\r\nand all that beauty, has her hour. Her hour,\" he went on deliberately,\r\n\"when she can say, 'there it is, at last, WIE IM TRAUM ICH. As in my\r\ndream I dreamed it, as in my will it was.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHe stood silent a moment, twisting the flower from his coat by the stem\r\nand staring at the blank wall with haggard abstraction. \"Even I can\r\nsay to-night, Archie,\" he brought out slowly, \"'As in my dream I dreamed\r\nit, as in my will it was.' Now, doctor, you may leave me. I'm beautifully\r\ndrunk, but not with anything that ever grew in France.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor rose. Fred tossed his flower out of the window behind him and\r\ncame toward the door. \"I say,\" he called, \"have you a date with\r\nanybody?\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor paused, his hand on the knob. \"With Thea, you mean? Yes. I'm\r\nto go to her at four this afternoon--if you haven't paralyzed me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you won't eat me, will you, if I break in and send up my card?\r\nShe'll probably turn me down cold, but that won't hurt my feelings. If\r\nshe ducks me, you tell her for me, that to spite me now she'd have to\r\ncut off more than she can spare. Good-night, Archie.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nIT was late on the morning after the night she sang ELSA, when Thea\r\nKronborg stirred uneasily in her bed. The room was darkened by two sets\r\nof window shades, and the day outside was thick and cloudy. She turned\r\nand tried to recapture unconsciousness, knowing that she would not be\r\nable to do so. She dreaded waking stale and disappointed after a great\r\neffort. The first thing that came was always the sense of the futility\r\nof such endeavor, and of the absurdity of trying too hard. Up to a\r\ncertain point, say eighty degrees, artistic endeavor could be fat and\r\ncomfortable, methodical and prudent. But if you went further than that,\r\nif you drew yourself up toward ninety degrees, you parted with your\r\ndefenses and left yourself exposed to mischance. The legend was that in\r\nthose upper reaches you might be divine; but you were much likelier to\r\nbe ridiculous. Your public wanted just about eighty degrees; if you gave\r\nit more it blew its nose and put a crimp in you. In the morning,\r\nespecially, it seemed to her very probable that whatever struggled above\r\nthe good average was not quite sound. Certainly very little of that\r\nsuperfluous ardor, which cost so dear, ever got across the footlights.\r\nThese misgivings waited to pounce upon her when she wakened. They\r\nhovered about her bed like vultures.\r\n\r\nShe reached under her pillow for her handkerchief, without opening her\r\neyes. She had a shadowy memory that there was to be something unusual,\r\nthat this day held more disquieting possibilities than days commonly\r\nheld. There was something she dreaded; what was it? Oh, yes, Dr. Archie\r\nwas to come at four.\r\n\r\nA reality like Dr. Archie, poking up out of the past, reminded one\r\nof disappointments and losses, of a freedom that was no more:\r\nreminded her of blue, golden mornings long ago, when she used to waken\r\nwith a burst of joy at recovering her precious self and her precious\r\nworld; when she never lay on her pillows at eleven o'clock like\r\nsomething the waves had washed up. After all, why had he come? It had\r\nbeen so long, and so much had happened. The things she had lost, he\r\nwould miss readily enough. What she had gained, he would scarcely\r\nperceive. He, and all that he recalled, lived for her as memories. In\r\nsleep, and in hours of illness or exhaustion, she went back to them and\r\nheld them to her heart. But they were better as memories. They had\r\nnothing to do with the struggle that made up her actual life. She felt\r\ndrearily that she was not flexible enough to be the person her old\r\nfriend expected her to be, the person she herself wished to be with him.\r\n\r\nThea reached for the bell and rang twice,--a signal to her maid to order\r\nher breakfast. She rose and ran up the window shades and turned on the\r\nwater in her bathroom, glancing into the mirror apprehensively as she\r\npassed it. Her bath usually cheered her, even on low mornings like this.\r\nHer white bathroom, almost as large as her sleeping-room, she regarded as\r\na refuge. When she turned the key behind her, she left care and vexation\r\non the other side of the door. Neither her maid nor the management nor\r\nher letters nor her accompanist could get at her now.\r\n\r\nWhen she pinned her braids about her head, dropped her nightgown and\r\nstepped out to begin her Swedish movements, she was a natural creature\r\nagain, and it was so that she liked herself best. She slid into the tub\r\nwith anticipation and splashed and tumbled about a good deal. Whatever\r\nelse she hurried, she never hurried her bath. She used her brushes and\r\nsponges and soaps like toys, fairly playing in the water. Her own body\r\nwas always a cheering sight to her. When she was careworn, when her mind\r\nfelt old and tired, the freshness of her physical self, her long, firm\r\nlines, the smoothness of her skin, reassured her. This morning, because\r\nof awakened memories, she looked at herself more carefully than usual,\r\nand was not discouraged. While she was in the tub she began to whistle\r\nsoftly the tenor aria, \"AH! FUYEZ, DOUCE IMAGE,\" somehow appropriate to\r\nthe bath. After a noisy moment under the cold shower, she stepped out on\r\nthe rug flushed and glowing, threw her arms above her head, and rose on\r\nher toes, keeping the elevation as long as she could. When she dropped\r\nback on her heels and began to rub herself with the towels, she took up\r\nthe aria again, and felt quite in the humor for seeing Dr. Archie. After\r\nshe had returned to her bed, the maid brought her letters and the\r\nmorning papers with her breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"Telephone Mr. Landry and ask him if he can come at half-past three,\r\nTheresa, and order tea to be brought up at five.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Howard Archie was admitted to Thea's apartment that afternoon, he\r\nwas shown into the music-room back of the little reception room. Thea\r\nwas sitting in a davenport behind the piano, talking to a young man whom\r\nshe later introduced as her friend Mr. Landry. As she rose, and came to\r\nmeet him, Archie felt a deep relief, a sudden thankfulness. She no\r\nlonger looked clipped and plucked, or dazed and fleeing.\r\n\r\nDr. Archie neglected to take account of the young man to whom he was\r\npresented. He kept Thea's hands and held her where he met her, taking in\r\nthe light, lively sweep of her hair, her clear green eyes and her throat\r\nthat came up strong and dazzlingly white from her green velvet gown. The\r\nchin was as lovely as ever, the cheeks as smooth. All the lines of last\r\nnight had disappeared. Only at the outer corners of her eyes, between\r\nthe eye and the temple, were the faintest indications of a future\r\nattack--mere kitten scratches that playfully hinted where one day the\r\ncat would claw her. He studied her without any embarrassment. Last night\r\neverything had been awkward; but now, as he held her hands, a kind of\r\nharmony came between them, a reestablishment of confidence.\r\n\r\n\"After all, Thea,--in spite of all, I still know you,\" he murmured.\r\n\r\nShe took his arm and led him up to the young man who was standing beside\r\nthe piano. \"Mr. Landry knows all about you, Dr. Archie. He has known\r\nabout you for many years.\" While the two men shook hands she stood\r\nbetween them, drawing them together by her presence and her glances.\r\n\"When I first went to Germany, Landry was studying there. He used to be\r\ngood enough to work with me when I could not afford to have an\r\naccompanist for more than two hours a day. We got into the way of\r\nworking together. He is a singer, too, and has his own career to look\r\nafter, but he still manages to give me some time. I want you to be\r\nfriends.\" She smiled from one to the other.\r\n\r\nThe rooms, Archie noticed, full of last night's flowers, were furnished\r\nin light colors, the hotel bleakness of them a little softened by a\r\nmagnificent Steinway piano, white bookshelves full of books and scores,\r\nsome drawings of ballet dancers, and the very deep sofa behind the\r\npiano.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" Archie asked apologetically, \"you have seen the papers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very cordial, aren't they? They evidently did not expect as much as I\r\ndid. ELSA is not really in my voice. I can sing the music, but I have to\r\ngo after it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is exactly,\" the doctor came out boldly, \"what Fred Ottenburg said\r\nthis morning.\"\r\n\r\nThey had remained standing, the three of them, by the piano, where the\r\ngray afternoon light was strongest. Thea turned to the doctor with\r\ninterest. \"Is Fred in town? They were from him, then--some flowers that\r\ncame last night without a card.\" She indicated the white lilacs on the\r\nwindow sill. \"Yes, he would know, certainly,\" she said thoughtfully.\r\n\"Why don't we sit down? There will be some tea for you in a minute,\r\nLandry. He's very dependent upon it,\" disapprovingly to Archie. \"Now\r\ntell me, Doctor, did you really have a good time last night, or were you\r\nuncomfortable? Did you feel as if I were trying to hold my hat on by my\r\neyebrows?\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled. \"I had all kinds of a time. But I had no feeling of that\r\nsort. I couldn't be quite sure that it was you at all. That was why I\r\ncame up here last night. I felt as if I'd lost you.\"\r\n\r\nShe leaned toward him and brushed his sleeve reassuringly. \"Then I\r\ndidn't give you an impression of painful struggle? Landry was singing at\r\nWeber and Fields' last night. He didn't get in until the performance was\r\nhalf over. But I see the TRIBUNE man felt that I was working pretty\r\nhard. Did you see that notice, Oliver?\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie looked closely at the red-headed young man for the first\r\ntime, and met his lively brown eyes, full of a droll, confiding sort of\r\nhumor. Mr. Landry was not prepossessing. He was undersized and clumsily\r\nmade, with a red, shiny face and a sharp little nose that looked as if\r\nit had been whittled out of wood and was always in the air, on the scent\r\nof something. Yet it was this queer little beak, with his eyes, that\r\nmade his countenance anything of a face at all. From a distance he\r\nlooked like the groceryman's delivery boy in a small town. His dress\r\nseemed an acknowledgment of his grotesqueness: a short coat, like a\r\nlittle boys' roundabout, and a vest fantastically sprigged and dotted,\r\nover a lavender shirt.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of a muffled buzz, Mr. Landry sprang up.\r\n\r\n\"May I answer the telephone for you?\" He went to the writing-table and\r\ntook up the receiver. \"Mr. Ottenburg is downstairs,\" he said, turning to\r\nThea and holding the mouthpiece against his coat.\r\n\r\n\"Tell him to come up,\" she replied without hesitation. \"How long are you\r\ngoing to be in town, Dr. Archie?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, several weeks, if you'll let me stay. I won't hang around and be a\r\nburden to you, but I want to try to get educated up to you, though I\r\nexpect it's late to begin.\"\r\n\r\nThea rose and touched him lightly on the shoulder. \"Well, you'll never\r\nbe any younger, will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not so sure about that,\" the doctor replied gallantly.\r\n\r\nThe maid appeared at the door and announced Mr. Frederick Ottenburg.\r\nFred came in, very much got up, the doctor reflected, as he watched him\r\nbending over Thea's hand. He was still pale and looked somewhat\r\nchastened, and the lock of hair that hung down over his forehead was\r\ndistinctly moist. But his black afternoon coat, his gray tie and gaiters\r\nwere of a correctness that Dr. Archie could never attain for all the\r\nefforts of his faithful slave, Van Deusen, the Denver haberdasher. To be\r\nproperly up to those tricks, the doctor supposed, you had to learn them\r\nyoung. If he were to buy a silk hat that was the twin of Ottenburg's, it\r\nwould be shaggy in a week, and he could never carry it as Fred held his.\r\n\r\nOttenburg had greeted Thea in German, and as she replied in the same\r\nlanguage, Archie joined Mr. Landry at the window. \"You know Mr.\r\nOttenburg, he tells me?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Landry's eyes twinkled. \"Yes, I regularly follow him about, when\r\nhe's in town. I would, even if he didn't send me such wonderful\r\nChristmas presents: Russian vodka by the half-dozen!\"\r\n\r\nThea called to them, \"Come, Mr. Ottenburg is calling on all of us.\r\nHere's the tea.\"\r\n\r\nThe maid opened the door and two waiters from downstairs appeared with\r\ncovered trays. The tea-table was in the parlor. Thea drew Ottenburg with\r\nher and went to inspect it. \"Where's the rum? Oh, yes, in that thing!\r\nEverything seems to be here, but send up some currant preserves and\r\ncream cheese for Mr. Ottenburg. And in about fifteen minutes, bring some\r\nfresh toast. That's all, thank you.\"\r\n\r\nFor the next few minutes there was a clatter of teacups and responses\r\nabout sugar. \"Landry always takes rum. I'm glad the rest of you don't.\r\nI'm sure it's bad.\" Thea poured the tea standing and got through with it\r\nas quickly as possible, as if it were a refreshment snatched between\r\ntrains. The tea-table and the little room in which it stood seemed to be\r\nout of scale with her long step, her long reach, and the energy of her\r\nmovements. Dr. Archie, standing near her, was pleasantly aware of the\r\nanimation of her figure. Under the clinging velvet, her body seemed\r\nindependent and unsubdued.\r\n\r\nThey drifted, with their plates and cups, back to the music-room. When\r\nThea followed them, Ottenburg put down his tea suddenly. \"Aren't you\r\ntaking anything? Please let me.\" He started back to the table.\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you, nothing. I'm going to run over that aria for you\r\npresently, to convince you that I can do it. How did the duet go, with\r\nSchlag?\"\r\n\r\nShe was standing in the doorway and Fred came up to her: \"That you'll\r\nnever do any better. You've worked your voice into it perfectly. Every\r\nNUANCE--wonderful!\"\r\n\r\n\"Think so?\" She gave him a sidelong glance and spoke with a certain\r\ngruff shyness which did not deceive anybody, and was not meant to\r\ndeceive. The tone was equivalent to \"Keep it up. I like it, but I'm\r\nawkward with it.\"\r\n\r\nFred held her by the door and did keep it up, furiously, for full five\r\nminutes. She took it with some confusion, seeming all the while to be\r\nhesitating, to be arrested in her course and trying to pass him. But she\r\ndid not really try to pass, and her color deepened. Fred spoke in\r\nGerman, and Archie caught from her an occasional JA? SO? muttered rather\r\nthan spoken.\r\n\r\nWhen they rejoined Landry and Dr. Archie, Fred took up his tea again. \"I\r\nsee you're singing VENUS Saturday night. Will they never let you have a\r\nchance at ELIZABETH?\"\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders. \"Not here. There are so many singers here,\r\nand they try us out in such a stingy way. Think of it, last year I came\r\nover in October, and it was the first of December before I went on at\r\nall! I'm often sorry I left Dresden.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still,\" Fred argued, \"Dresden is limited.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so, and I've begun to sigh for those very limitations. In New York\r\neverything is impersonal. Your audience never knows its own mind, and\r\nits mind is never twice the same. I'd rather sing where the people are\r\npig-headed and throw carrots at you if you don't do it the way they like\r\nit. The house here is splendid, and the night audiences are exciting. I\r\nhate the matinees; like singing at a KAFFEKLATSCH.\" She rose and turned\r\non the lights.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" Fred exclaimed, \"why do you do that? That is a signal that tea is\r\nover.\" He got up and drew out his gloves.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. Shall you be here Saturday night?\" She sat down on the\r\npiano bench and leaned her elbow back on the keyboard. \"Necker sings\r\nELIZABETH. Make Dr. Archie go. Everything she sings is worth hearing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she's failing so. The last time I heard her she had no voice at\r\nall. She IS a poor vocalist!\"\r\n\r\nThea cut him off. \"She's a great artist, whether she's in voice or not,\r\nand she's the only one here. If you want a big voice, you can take my\r\nORTRUDE of last night; that's big enough, and vulgar enough.\"\r\n\r\nFred laughed and turned away, this time with decision. \"I don't want\r\nher!\" he protested energetically. \"I only wanted to get a rise out of\r\nyou. I like Necker's ELIZABETH well enough. I like your VENUS well\r\nenough, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a beautiful part, and it's often dreadfully sung. It's very hard\r\nto sing, of course.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg bent over the hand she held out to him. \"For an uninvited\r\nguest, I've fared very well. You were nice to let me come up. I'd have\r\nbeen terribly cut up if you'd sent me away. May I?\" He kissed her hand\r\nlightly and backed toward the door, still smiling, and promising to keep\r\nan eye on Archie. \"He can't be trusted at all, Thea. One of the waiters\r\nat Martin's worked a Tourainian hare off on him at luncheon yesterday,\r\nfor seven twenty-five.\"\r\n\r\nThea broke into a laugh, the deep one he recognized. \"Did he have a\r\nribbon on, this hare? Did they bring him in a gilt cage?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\"--Archie spoke up for himself,--\"they brought him in a brown sauce,\r\nwhich was very good. He didn't taste very different from any rabbit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably came from a push-cart on the East Side.\" Thea looked at her\r\nold friend commiseratingly. \"Yes, DO keep an eye on him, Fred. I had no\r\nidea,\" shaking her head. \"Yes, I'll be obliged to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Count on me!\" Their eyes met in a gay smile, and Fred bowed himself\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nON Saturday night Dr. Archie went with Fred Ottenburg to hear\r\n\"Tannhauser.\" Thea had a rehearsal on Sunday afternoon, but as she was\r\nnot on the bill again until Wednesday, she promised to dine with Archie\r\nand Ottenburg on Monday, if they could make the dinner early.\r\n\r\nAt a little after eight on Monday evening, the three friends returned to\r\nThea's apartment and seated themselves for an hour of quiet talk.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry we couldn't have had Landry with us tonight,\" Thea said, \"but\r\nhe's on at Weber and Fields' every night now. You ought to hear him, Dr.\r\nArchie. He often sings the old Scotch airs you used to love.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not go down this evening?\" Fred suggested hopefully, glancing at\r\nhis watch. \"That is, if you'd like to go. I can telephone and find what\r\ntime he comes on.\"\r\n\r\nThea hesitated. \"No, I think not. I took a long walk this afternoon and\r\nI'm rather tired. I think I can get to sleep early and be so much ahead.\r\nI don't mean at once, however,\" seeing Dr. Archie's disappointed look.\r\n\"I always like to hear Landry,\" she added. \"He never had much voice, and\r\nit's worn, but there's a sweetness about it, and he sings with such\r\ntaste.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, doesn't he? May I?\" Fred took out his cigarette case. \"It really\r\ndoesn't bother your throat?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little doesn't. But cigar smoke does. Poor Dr. Archie! Can you do\r\nwith one of those?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm learning to like them,\" the doctor declared, taking one from the\r\ncase Fred proffered him.\r\n\r\n\"Landry's the only fellow I know in this country who can do that sort of\r\nthing,\" Fred went on. \"Like the best English ballad singers. He can sing\r\neven popular stuff by higher lights, as it were.\"\r\n\r\nThea nodded. \"Yes; sometimes I make him sing his most foolish things for\r\nme. It's restful, as he does it. That's when I'm homesick, Dr. Archie.\"\r\n\r\n\"You knew him in Germany, Thea?\" Dr. Archie had quietly abandoned his\r\ncigarette as a comfortless article. \"When you first went over?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He was a good friend to a green girl. He helped me with my German\r\nand my music and my general discouragement. Seemed to care more about my\r\ngetting on than about himself. He had no money, either. An old aunt had\r\nloaned him a little to study on.--Will you answer that, Fred?\"\r\n\r\nFred caught up the telephone and stopped the buzz while Thea went on\r\ntalking to Dr. Archie about Landry. Telling some one to hold the wire,\r\nhe presently put down the instrument and approached Thea with a startled\r\nexpression on his face.\r\n\r\n\"It's the management,\" he said quietly. \"Gloeckler has broken down:\r\nfainting fits. Madame Rheinecker is in Atlantic City and Schramm is\r\nsinging in Philadelphia tonight. They want to know whether you can come\r\ndown and finish SIEGLINDE.\"\r\n\r\n\"What time is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eight fifty-five. The first act is just over. They can hold the curtain\r\ntwenty-five minutes.\"\r\n\r\nThea did not move. \"Twenty-five and thirty-five makes sixty,\" she\r\nmuttered. \"Tell them I'll come if they hold the curtain till I am in the\r\ndressing-room. Say I'll have to wear her costumes, and the dresser must\r\nhave everything ready. Then call a taxi, please.\"\r\n\r\nThea had not changed her position since he first interrupted her, but\r\nshe had grown pale and was opening and shutting her hands rapidly. She\r\nlooked, Fred thought, terrified. He half turned toward the telephone,\r\nbut hung on one foot.\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever sung the part?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, but I've rehearsed it. That's all right. Get the cab.\" Still she\r\nmade no move. She merely turned perfectly blank eyes to Dr. Archie and\r\nsaid absently, \"It's curious, but just at this minute I can't remember a\r\nbar of 'Walkure' after the first act. And I let my maid go out.\" She\r\nsprang up and beckoned Archie without so much, he felt sure, as knowing\r\nwho he was. \"Come with me.\" She went quickly into her sleeping-chamber\r\nand threw open a door into a trunk-room. \"See that white trunk? It's not\r\nlocked. It's full of wigs, in boxes. Look until you find one marked\r\n'Ring 2.' Bring it quick!\" While she directed him, she threw open a\r\nsquare trunk and began tossing out shoes of every shape and color.\r\n\r\nOttenburg appeared at the door. \"Can I help you?\"\r\n\r\nShe threw him some white sandals with long laces and silk stockings\r\npinned to them. \"Put those in something, and then go to the piano and\r\ngive me a few measures in there--you know.\" She was behaving somewhat\r\nlike a cyclone now, and while she wrenched open drawers and closet\r\ndoors, Ottenburg got to the piano as quickly as possible and began to\r\nherald the reappearance of the Volsung pair, trusting to memory.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments Thea came out enveloped in her long fur coat with a\r\nscarf over her head and knitted woolen gloves on her hands. Her glassy\r\neye took in the fact that Fred was playing from memory, and even in her\r\ndistracted state, a faint smile flickered over her colorless lips. She\r\nstretched out a woolly hand, \"The score, please. Behind you, there.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie followed with a canvas box and a satchel. As they went\r\nthrough the hall, the men caught up their hats and coats. They left the\r\nmusic-room, Fred noticed, just seven minutes after he got the telephone\r\nmessage. In the elevator Thea said in that husky whisper which had so\r\nperplexed Dr. Archie when he first heard it, \"Tell the driver he must do\r\nit in twenty minutes, less if he can. He must leave the light on in the\r\ncab. I can do a good deal in twenty minutes. If only you hadn't made me\r\neat--Damn that duck!\" she broke out bitterly; \"why did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wish I had it back! But it won't bother you, to-night. You need\r\nstrength,\" he pleaded consolingly.\r\n\r\nBut she only muttered angrily under her breath, \"Idiot, idiot!\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg shot ahead and instructed the driver, while the doctor put\r\nThea into the cab and shut the door. She did not speak to either of them\r\nagain. As the driver scrambled into his seat she opened the score and\r\nfixed her eyes upon it. Her face, in the white light, looked as bleak as\r\na stone quarry.\r\n\r\nAs her cab slid away, Ottenburg shoved Archie into a second taxi that\r\nwaited by the curb. \"We'd better trail her,\" he explained. \"There might\r\nbe a hold-up of some kind.\" As the cab whizzed off he broke into an\r\neruption of profanity.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, Fred?\" the doctor asked. He was a good deal dazed by\r\nthe rapid evolutions of the last ten minutes.\r\n\r\n\"Matter enough!\" Fred growled, buttoning his overcoat with a shiver.\r\n\"What a way to sing a part for the first time! That duck really is on my\r\nconscience. It will be a wonder if she can do anything but quack!\r\nScrambling on in the middle of a performance like this, with no\r\nrehearsal! The stuff she has to sing in there is a fright--rhythm,\r\npitch,--and terribly difficult intervals.\"\r\n\r\n\"She looked frightened,\" Dr. Archie said thoughtfully, \"but I thought\r\nshe looked--determined.\"\r\n\r\nFred sniffed. \"Oh, determined! That's the kind of rough deal that makes\r\nsavages of singers. Here's a part she's worked on and got ready for for\r\nyears, and now they give her a chance to go on and butcher it. Goodness\r\nknows when she's looked at the score last, or whether she can use the\r\nbusiness she's studied with this cast. Necker's singing BRUNNHILDE; she\r\nmay help her, if it's not one of her sore nights.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she sore at Thea?\" Dr. Archie asked wonderingly.\r\n\r\n\"My dear man, Necker's sore at everything. She's breaking up; too early;\r\njust when she ought to be at her best. There's one story that she is\r\nstruggling under some serious malady, another that she learned a bad\r\nmethod at the Prague Conservatory and has ruined her organ. She's the\r\nsorest thing in the world. If she weathers this winter through, it'll be\r\nher last. She's paying for it with the last rags of her voice. And\r\nthen--\" Fred whistled softly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then our girl may come in for some of it. It's dog eat dog, in this\r\ngame as in every other.\"\r\n\r\nThe cab stopped and Fred and Dr. Archie hurried to the box office. The\r\nMonday-night house was sold out. They bought standing room and entered\r\nthe auditorium just as the press representative of the house was\r\nthanking the audience for their patience and telling them that although\r\nMadame Gloeckler was too ill to sing, Miss Kronborg had kindly consented\r\nto finish her part. This announcement was met with vehement applause\r\nfrom the upper circles of the house.\r\n\r\n\"She has her--constituents,\" Dr. Archie murmured.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, up there, where they're young and hungry. These people down here\r\nhave dined too well. They won't mind, however. They like fires and\r\naccidents and DIVERTISSEMENTS. Two SIEGLINDES are more unusual than one,\r\nso they'll be satisfied.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the final disappearance of the mother of Siegfried, Ottenburg and\r\nthe doctor slipped out through the crowd and left the house. Near the\r\nstage entrance Fred found the driver who had brought Thea down. He\r\ndismissed him and got a larger car. He and Archie waited on the\r\nsidewalk, and when Kronborg came out alone they gathered her into the\r\ncab and sprang in after her.\r\n\r\nThea sank back into a corner of the back seat and yawned. \"Well, I got\r\nthrough, eh?\" Her tone was reassuring. \"On the whole, I think I've given\r\nyou gentlemen a pretty lively evening, for one who has no social\r\naccomplishments.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather! There was something like a popular uprising at the end of the\r\nsecond act. Archie and I couldn't keep it up as long as the rest of them\r\ndid. A howl like that ought to show the management which way the wind is\r\nblowing. You probably know you were magnificent.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought it went pretty well,\" she spoke impartially. \"I was rather\r\nsmart to catch his tempo there, at the beginning of the first\r\nrecitative, when he came in too soon, don't you think? It's tricky in\r\nthere, without a rehearsal. Oh, I was all right! He took that\r\nsyncopation too fast in the beginning. Some singers take it fast\r\nthere--think it sounds more impassioned. That's one way!\" She sniffed,\r\nand Fred shot a mirthful glance at Archie. Her boastfulness would have\r\nbeen childish in a schoolboy. In the light of what she had done, of the\r\nstrain they had lived through during the last two hours, it made one\r\nlaugh,--almost cry. She went on, robustly: \"And I didn't feel my dinner,\r\nreally, Fred. I am hungry again, I'm ashamed to say,--and I forgot to\r\norder anything at my hotel.\"\r\n\r\nFred put his hand on the door. \"Where to? You must have food.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know any quiet place, where I won't be stared at? I've still got\r\nmake-up on.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do. Nice English chop-house on Forty-fourth Street. Nobody there at\r\nnight but theater people after the show, and a few bachelors.\" He opened\r\nthe door and spoke to the driver.\r\n\r\nAs the car turned, Thea reached across to the front seat and drew Dr.\r\nArchie's handkerchief out of his breast pocket.\r\n\r\n\"This comes to me naturally,\" she said, rubbing her cheeks and eyebrows.\r\n\"When I was little I always loved your handkerchiefs because they were\r\nsilk and smelled of Cologne water. I think they must have been the only\r\nreally clean handkerchiefs in Moonstone. You were always wiping my face\r\nwith them, when you met me out in the dust, I remember. Did I never have\r\nany?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you'd nearly always used yours up on your baby brother.\"\r\n\r\nThea sighed. \"Yes, Thor had such a way of getting messy. You say he's a\r\ngood chauffeur?\" She closed her eyes for a moment as if they were tired.\r\nSuddenly she looked up. \"Isn't it funny, how we travel in circles? Here\r\nyou are, still getting me clean, and Fred is still feeding me. I would\r\nhave died of starvation at that boarding-house on Indiana Avenue if he\r\nhadn't taken me out to the Buckingham and filled me up once in a while.\r\nWhat a cavern I was to fill, too. The waiters used to look astonished.\r\nI'm still singing on that food.\"\r\n\r\nFred alighted and gave Thea his arm as they crossed the icy sidewalk.\r\nThey were taken upstairs in an antiquated lift and found the cheerful\r\nchop-room half full of supper parties. An English company playing at the\r\nEmpire had just come in. The waiters, in red waistcoats, were hurrying\r\nabout. Fred got a table at the back of the room, in a corner, and urged\r\nhis waiter to get the oysters on at once.\r\n\r\n\"Takes a few minutes to open them, sir,\" the man expostulated.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but make it as few as possible, and bring the lady's first. Then\r\ngrilled chops with kidneys, and salad.\"\r\n\r\nThea began eating celery stalks at once, from the base to the foliage.\r\n\"Necker said something nice to me tonight. You might have thought the\r\nmanagement would say something, but not they.\" She looked at Fred from\r\nunder her blackened lashes. \"It WAS a stunt, to jump in and sing that\r\nsecond act without rehearsal. It doesn't sing itself.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg was watching her brilliant eyes and her face. She was much\r\nhandsomer than she had been early in the evening. Excitement of this\r\nsort enriched her. It was only under such excitement, he reflected, that\r\nshe was entirely illuminated, or wholly present. At other times there\r\nwas something a little cold and empty, like a big room with no people in\r\nit. Even in her most genial moods there was a shadow of restlessness, as\r\nif she were waiting for something and were exercising the virtue of\r\npatience. During dinner she had been as kind as she knew how to be, to\r\nhim and to Archie, and had given them as much of herself as she could.\r\nBut, clearly, she knew only one way of being really kind, from the core\r\nof her heart out; and there was but one way in which she could give\r\nherself to people largely and gladly, spontaneously. Even as a girl she\r\nhad been at her best in vigorous effort, he remembered; physical effort,\r\nwhen there was no other kind at hand. She could be expansive only in\r\nexplosions. Old Nathanmeyer had seen it. In the very first song Fred had\r\never heard her sing, she had unconsciously declared it.\r\n\r\nThea Kronborg turned suddenly from her talk with Archie and peered\r\nsuspiciously into the corner where Ottenburg sat with folded arms,\r\nobserving her. \"What's the matter with you, Fred? I'm afraid of you when\r\nyou're quiet,--fortunately you almost never are. What are you thinking\r\nabout?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was wondering how you got right with the orchestra so quickly, there\r\nat first. I had a flash of terror,\" he replied easily.\r\n\r\nShe bolted her last oyster and ducked her head. \"So had I! I don't know\r\nhow I did catch it. Desperation, I suppose; same way the Indian babies\r\nswim when they're thrown into the river. I HAD to. Now it's over, I'm\r\nglad I had to. I learned a whole lot to-night.\"\r\n\r\nArchie, who usually felt that it behooved him to be silent during such\r\ndiscussions, was encouraged by her geniality to venture, \"I don't see\r\nhow you can learn anything in such a turmoil; or how you can keep your\r\nmind on it, for that matter.\"\r\n\r\nThea glanced about the room and suddenly put her hand up to her hair.\r\n\"Mercy, I've no hat on! Why didn't you tell me? And I seem to be wearing\r\na rumpled dinner dress, with all this paint on my face! I must look like\r\nsomething you picked up on Second Avenue. I hope there are no Colorado\r\nreformers about, Dr. Archie. What a dreadful old pair these people must\r\nbe thinking you! Well, I had to eat.\" She sniffed the savor of the grill\r\nas the waiter uncovered it. \"Yes, draught beer, please. No, thank you,\r\nFred, NO champagne.--To go back to your question, Dr. Archie, you can\r\nbelieve I keep my mind on it. That's the whole trick, in so far as stage\r\nexperience goes; keeping right there every second. If I think of\r\nanything else for a flash, I'm gone, done for. But at the same time, one\r\ncan take things in--with another part of your brain, maybe. It's\r\ndifferent from what you get in study, more practical and conclusive.\r\nThere are some things you learn best in calm, and some in storm. You\r\nlearn the delivery of a part only before an audience.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven help us,\" gasped Ottenburg. \"Weren't you hungry, though! It's\r\nbeautiful to see you eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Glad you like it. Of course I'm hungry. Are you staying over for\r\n'Rheingold' Friday afternoon?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Thea,\"--Fred lit a cigarette,--\"I'm a serious business man now.\r\nI have to sell beer. I'm due in Chicago on Wednesday. I'd come back to\r\nhear you, but FRICKA is not an alluring part.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you've never heard it well done.\" She spoke up hotly. \"Fat German\r\nwoman scolding her husband, eh? That's not my idea. Wait till you hear\r\nmy FRICKA. It's a beautiful part.\" Thea leaned forward on the table and\r\ntouched Archie's arm. \"You remember, Dr. Archie, how my mother always\r\nwore her hair, parted in the middle and done low on her neck behind, so\r\nyou got the shape of her head and such a calm, white forehead? I wear\r\nmine like that for FRICKA. A little more coronet effect, built up a\r\nlittle higher at the sides, but the idea's the same. I think you'll\r\nnotice it.\" She turned to Ottenburg reproachfully: \"It's noble music,\r\nFred, from the first measure. There's nothing lovelier than the WONNIGER\r\nHAUSRATH. It's all such comprehensive sort of music--fateful. Of course,\r\nFRICKA KNOWS,\" Thea ended quietly.\r\n\r\nFred sighed. \"There, you've spoiled my itinerary. Now I'll have to come\r\nback, of course. Archie, you'd better get busy about seats to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can get you box seats, somewhere. I know nobody here, and I never ask\r\nfor any.\" Thea began hunting among her wraps. \"Oh, how funny! I've only\r\nthese short woolen gloves, and no sleeves. Put on my coat first. Those\r\nEnglish people can't make out where you got your lady, she's so made up\r\nof contradictions.\" She rose laughing and plunged her arms into the coat\r\nDr. Archie held for her. As she settled herself into it and buttoned it\r\nunder her chin, she gave him an old signal with her eyelid. \"I'd like to\r\nsing another part to-night. This is the sort of evening I fancy, when\r\nthere's something to do. Let me see: I have to sing in 'Trovatore'\r\nWednesday night, and there are rehearsals for the 'Ring' every day this\r\nweek. Consider me dead until Saturday, Dr. Archie. I invite you both to\r\ndine with me on Saturday night, the day after 'Rheingold.' And Fred must\r\nleave early, for I want to talk to you alone. You've been here nearly a\r\nweek, and I haven't had a serious word with you. TAK FOR MAD, Fred, as\r\nthe Norwegians say.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTHE \"Ring of the Niebelungs\" was to be given at the Metropolitan on four\r\nsuccessive Friday afternoons. After the first of these performances,\r\nFred Ottenburg went home with Landry for tea. Landry was one of the few\r\npublic entertainers who own real estate in New York. He lived in a\r\nlittle three-story brick house on Jane Street, in Greenwich Village,\r\nwhich had been left to him by the same aunt who paid for his musical\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nLandry was born, and spent the first fifteen years of his life, on a\r\nrocky Connecticut farm not far from Cos Cob. His father was an ignorant,\r\nviolent man, a bungling farmer and a brutal husband. The farmhouse,\r\ndilapidated and damp, stood in a hollow beside a marshy pond. Oliver had\r\nworked hard while he lived at home, although he was never clean or warm\r\nin winter and had wretched food all the year round. His spare, dry\r\nfigure, his prominent larynx, and the peculiar red of his face and hands\r\nbelonged to the choreboy he had never outgrown. It was as if the farm,\r\nknowing he would escape from it as early as he could, had ground its\r\nmark on him deep. When he was fifteen Oliver ran away and went to live\r\nwith his Catholic aunt, on Jane Street, whom his mother was never\r\nallowed to visit. The priest of St. Joseph's Parish discovered that he\r\nhad a voice.\r\n\r\nLandry had an affection for the house on Jane Street, where he had first\r\nlearned what cleanliness and order and courtesy were. When his aunt died\r\nhe had the place done over, got an Irish housekeeper, and lived there\r\nwith a great many beautiful things he had collected. His living expenses\r\nwere never large, but he could not restrain himself from buying graceful\r\nand useless objects. He was a collector for much the same reason that he\r\nwas a Catholic, and he was a Catholic chiefly because his father used to\r\nsit in the kitchen and read aloud to his hired men disgusting\r\n\"exposures\" of the Roman Church, enjoying equally the hideous stories\r\nand the outrage to his wife's feelings.\r\n\r\nAt first Landry bought books; then rugs, drawings, china. He had a\r\nbeautiful collection of old French and Spanish fans. He kept them in an\r\nescritoire he had brought from Spain, but there were always a few of\r\nthem lying about in his sitting-room.\r\n\r\nWhile Landry and his guest were waiting for the tea to be brought,\r\nOttenburg took up one of these fans from the low marble mantel-shelf and\r\nopened it in the firelight. One side was painted with a pearly sky and\r\nfloating clouds. On the other was a formal garden where an elegant\r\nshepherdess with a mask and crook was fleeing on high heels from a\r\nsatin-coated shepherd.\r\n\r\n\"You ought not to keep these things about, like this, Oliver. The dust\r\nfrom your grate must get at them.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does, but I get them to enjoy them, not to have them. They're\r\npleasant to glance at and to play with at odd times like this, when one\r\nis waiting for tea or something.\"\r\n\r\nFred smiled. The idea of Landry stretched out before his fire playing\r\nwith his fans, amused him. Mrs. McGinnis brought the tea and put it\r\nbefore the hearth: old teacups that were velvety to the touch and a\r\npot-bellied silver cream pitcher of an Early Georgian pattern, which was\r\nalways brought, though Landry took rum.\r\n\r\nFred drank his tea walking about, examining Landry's sumptuous\r\nwriting-table in the alcove and the Boucher drawing in red chalk over\r\nthe mantel. \"I don't see how you can stand this place without a heroine.\r\nIt would give me a raging thirst for gallantries.\"\r\n\r\nLandry was helping himself to a second cup of tea. \"Works quite the\r\nother way with me. It consoles me for the lack of her. It's just\r\nfeminine enough to be pleasant to return to. Not any more tea? Then sit\r\ndown and play for me. I'm always playing for other people, and I never\r\nhave a chance to sit here quietly and listen.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg opened the piano and began softly to boom forth the shadowy\r\nintroduction to the opera they had just heard. \"Will that do?\" he asked\r\njokingly. \"I can't seem to get it out of my head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, excellently! Thea told me it was quite wonderful, the way you can\r\ndo Wagner scores on the piano. So few people can give one any idea of\r\nthe music. Go ahead, as long as you like. I can smoke, too.\" Landry\r\nflattened himself out on his cushions and abandoned himself to ease with\r\nthe circumstance of one who has never grown quite accustomed to ease.\r\n\r\nOttenburg played on, as he happened to remember. He understood now why\r\nThea wished him to hear her in \"Rheingold.\" It had been clear to him as\r\nsoon as FRICKA rose from sleep and looked out over the young world,\r\nstretching one white arm toward the new Gotterburg shining on the\r\nheights. \"WOTAN! GEMAHL! ERWACHE!\" She was pure Scandinavian, this\r\nFRICKA: \"Swedish summer\"! he remembered old Mr. Nathanmeyer's phrase.\r\nShe had wished him to see her because she had a distinct kind of\r\nloveliness for this part, a shining beauty like the light of sunset on\r\ndistant sails. She seemed to take on the look of immortal loveliness,\r\nthe youth of the golden apples, the shining body and the shining mind.\r\nFRICKA had been a jealous spouse to him for so long that he had forgot\r\nshe meant wisdom before she meant domestic order, and that, in any\r\nevent, she was always a goddess. The FRICKA of that afternoon was so\r\nclear and sunny, so nobly conceived, that she made a whole atmosphere\r\nabout herself and quite redeemed from shabbiness the helplessness and\r\nunscrupulousness of the gods. Her reproaches to WOTAN were the pleadings\r\nof a tempered mind, a consistent sense of beauty. In the long silences\r\nof her part, her shining presence was a visible complement to the\r\ndiscussion of the orchestra. As the themes which were to help in weaving\r\nthe drama to its end first came vaguely upon the ear, one saw their\r\nimport and tendency in the face of this clearest-visioned of the gods.\r\n\r\nIn the scene between FRICKA and WOTAN, Ottenburg stopped. \"I can't seem\r\nto get the voices, in there.\"\r\n\r\nLandry chuckled. \"Don't try. I know it well enough. I expect I've been\r\nover that with her a thousand times. I was playing for her almost every\r\nday when she was first working on it. When she begins with a part she's\r\nhard to work with: so slow you'd think she was stupid if you didn't know\r\nher. Of course she blames it all on her accompanist. It goes on like\r\nthat for weeks sometimes. This did. She kept shaking her head and\r\nstaring and looking gloomy. All at once, she got her line--it usually\r\ncomes suddenly, after stretches of not getting anywhere at all--and\r\nafter that it kept changing and clearing. As she worked her voice into\r\nit, it got more and more of that 'gold' quality that makes her FRICKA so\r\ndifferent.\"\r\n\r\nFred began FRICKA'S first aria again. \"It's certainly different. Curious\r\nhow she does it. Such a beautiful idea, out of a part that's always been\r\nso ungrateful. She's a lovely thing, but she was never so beautiful as\r\nthat, really. Nobody is.\" He repeated the loveliest phrase. \"How does\r\nshe manage it, Landry? You've worked with her.\"\r\n\r\nLandry drew cherishingly on the last cigarette he meant to permit\r\nhimself before singing. \"Oh, it's a question of a big personality--and\r\nall that goes with it. Brains, of course. Imagination, of course. But\r\nthe important thing is that she was born full of color, with a rich\r\npersonality. That's a gift of the gods, like a fine nose. You have it,\r\nor you haven't. Against it, intelligence and musicianship and habits of\r\nindustry don't count at all. Singers are a conventional race. When Thea\r\nwas studying in Berlin the other girls were mortally afraid of her. She\r\nhas a pretty rough hand with women, dull ones, and she could be rude,\r\ntoo! The girls used to call her DIE WOLFIN.\"\r\n\r\nFred thrust his hands into his pockets and leaned back against the\r\npiano. \"Of course, even a stupid woman could get effects with such\r\nmachinery: such a voice and body and face. But they couldn't possibly\r\nbelong to a stupid woman, could they?\"\r\n\r\nLandry shook his head. \"It's personality; that's as near as you can come\r\nto it. That's what constitutes real equipment. What she does is\r\ninteresting because she does it. Even the things she discards are\r\nsuggestive. I regret some of them. Her conceptions are colored in so\r\nmany different ways. You've heard her ELIZABETH? Wonderful, isn't it?\r\nShe was working on that part years ago when her mother was ill. I could\r\nsee her anxiety and grief getting more and more into the part. The last\r\nact is heart-breaking. It's as homely as a country prayer meeting: might\r\nbe any lonely woman getting ready to die. It's full of the thing every\r\nplain creature finds out for himself, but that never gets written down.\r\nIt's unconscious memory, maybe; inherited memory, like folk-music. I\r\ncall it personality.\"\r\n\r\nFred laughed, and turning to the piano began coaxing the FRICKA music\r\nagain. \"Call it anything you like, my boy. I have a name for it myself,\r\nbut I shan't tell you.\" He looked over his shoulder at Landry, stretched\r\nout by the fire. \"You have a great time watching her, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes!\" replied Landry simply. \"I'm not interested in much that goes\r\non in New York. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll have to dress.\" He rose\r\nwith a reluctant sigh. \"Can I get you anything? Some whiskey?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, no. I'll amuse myself here. I don't often get a chance at a\r\ngood piano when I'm away from home. You haven't had this one long, have\r\nyou? Action's a bit stiff. I say,\" he stopped Landry in the doorway,\r\n\"has Thea ever been down here?\"\r\n\r\nLandry turned back. \"Yes. She came several times when I had erysipelas.\r\nI was a nice mess, with two nurses. She brought down some inside\r\nwindow-boxes, planted with crocuses and things. Very cheering, only I\r\ncouldn't see them or her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't she like your place?\"\r\n\r\n\"She thought she did, but I fancy it was a good deal cluttered up for\r\nher taste. I could hear her pacing about like something in a cage. She\r\npushed the piano back against the wall and the chairs into corners, and\r\nshe broke my amber elephant.\" Landry took a yellow object some four\r\ninches high from one of his low bookcases. \"You can see where his leg is\r\nglued on,--a souvenir. Yes, he's lemon amber, very fine.\"\r\n\r\nLandry disappeared behind the curtains and in a moment Fred heard the\r\nwheeze of an atomizer. He put the amber elephant on the piano beside him\r\nand seemed to get a great deal of amusement out of the beast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nWHEN Archie and Ottenburg dined with Thea on Saturday evening, they were\r\nserved downstairs in the hotel dining-room, but they were to have their\r\ncoffee in her own apartment. As they were going up in the elevator after\r\ndinner, Fred turned suddenly to Thea. \"And why, please, did you break\r\nLandry's amber elephant?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked guilty and began to laugh. \"Hasn't he got over that yet? I\r\ndidn't really mean to break it. I was perhaps careless. His things are\r\nso over-petted that I was tempted to be careless with a lot of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you be so heartless, when they're all he has in the world?\"\r\n\r\n\"He has me. I'm a great deal of diversion for him; all he needs. There,\"\r\nshe said as she opened the door into her own hall, \"I shouldn't have\r\nsaid that before the elevator boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even an elevator boy couldn't make a scandal about Oliver. He's such a\r\ncatnip man.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie laughed, but Thea, who seemed suddenly to have thought of\r\nsomething annoying, repeated blankly, \"Catnip man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he lives on catnip, and rum tea. But he's not the only one. You\r\nare like an eccentric old woman I know in Boston, who goes about in the\r\nspring feeding catnip to street cats. You dispense it to a lot of\r\nfellows. Your pull seems to be more with men than with women, you know;\r\nwith seasoned men, about my age, or older. Even on Friday afternoon I\r\nkept running into them, old boys I hadn't seen for years, thin at the\r\npart and thick at the girth, until I stood still in the draft and held\r\nmy hair on. They're always there; I hear them talking about you in the\r\nsmoking room. Probably we don't get to the point of apprehending\r\nanything good until we're about forty. Then, in the light of what is\r\ngoing, and of what, God help us! is coming, we arrive at understanding.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why people go to the opera, anyway,--serious people.\" She\r\nspoke discontentedly. \"I suppose they get something, or think they do.\r\nHere's the coffee. There, please,\" she directed the waiter. Going to the\r\ntable she began to pour the coffee, standing. She wore a white dress\r\ntrimmed with crystals which had rattled a good deal during dinner, as\r\nall her movements had been impatient and nervous, and she had twisted\r\nthe dark velvet rose at her girdle until it looked rumpled and weary.\r\nShe poured the coffee as if it were a ceremony in which she did not\r\nbelieve. \"Can you make anything of Fred's nonsense, Dr. Archie?\" she\r\nasked, as he came to take his cup.\r\n\r\nFred approached her. \"My nonsense is all right. The same brand has gone\r\nwith you before. It's you who won't be jollied. What's the matter? You\r\nhave something on your mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've a good deal. Too much to be an agreeable hostess.\" She turned\r\nquickly away from the coffee and sat down on the piano bench, facing the\r\ntwo men. \"For one thing, there's a change in the cast for Friday\r\nafternoon. They're going to let me sing SIEGLINDE.\" Her frown did not\r\nconceal the pleasure with which she made this announcement.\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to keep us dangling about here forever, Thea? Archie and\r\nI are supposed to have other things to do.\" Fred looked at her with an\r\nexcitement quite as apparent as her own.\r\n\r\n\"Here I've been ready to sing SIEGLINDE for two years, kept in torment,\r\nand now it comes off within two weeks, just when I want to be seeing\r\nsomething of Dr. Archie. I don't know what their plans are down there.\r\nAfter Friday they may let me cool for several weeks, and they may rush\r\nme. I suppose it depends somewhat on how things go Friday afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they'll go fast enough! That's better suited to your voice than\r\nanything you've sung here. That gives you every opportunity I've waited\r\nfor.\" Ottenburg crossed the room and standing beside her began to play\r\n\"DU BIST DER LENZ.\"\r\n\r\nWith a violent movement Thea caught his wrists and pushed his hands away\r\nfrom the keys.\r\n\r\n\"Fred, can't you be serious? A thousand things may happen between this\r\nand Friday to put me out. Something will happen. If that part were sung\r\nwell, as well as it ought to be, it would be one of the most beautiful\r\nthings in the world. That's why it never is sung right, and never will\r\nbe.\" She clenched her hands and opened them despairingly, looking out of\r\nthe open window. \"It's inaccessibly beautiful!\" she brought out sharply.\r\n\r\nFred and Dr. Archie watched her. In a moment she turned back to them.\r\n\"It's impossible to sing a part like that well for the first time,\r\nexcept for the sort who will never sing it any better. Everything hangs\r\non that first night, and that's bound to be bad. There you are,\" she\r\nshrugged impatiently. \"For one thing, they change the cast at the\r\neleventh hour and then rehearse the life out of me.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg put down his cup with exaggerated care. \"Still, you really\r\nwant to do it, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Want to?\" she repeated indignantly; \"of course I want to! If this were\r\nonly next Thursday night--But between now and Friday I'll do nothing but\r\nfret away my strength. Oh, I'm not saying I don't need the rehearsals!\r\nBut I don't need them strung out through a week. That system's well\r\nenough for phlegmatic singers; it only drains me. Every single feature\r\nof operatic routine is detrimental to me. I usually go on like a horse\r\nthat's been fixed to lose a race. I have to work hard to do my worst,\r\nlet alone my best. I wish you could hear me sing well, once,\" she turned\r\nto Fred defiantly; \"I have, a few times in my life, when there was\r\nnothing to gain by it.\"\r\n\r\nFred approached her again and held out his hand. \"I recall my\r\ninstructions, and now I'll leave you to fight it out with Archie. He\r\ncan't possibly represent managerial stupidity to you as I seem to have a\r\ngift for doing.\"\r\n\r\nAs he smiled down at her, his good humor, his good wishes, his\r\nunderstanding, embarrassed her and recalled her to herself. She kept her\r\nseat, still holding his hand. \"All the same, Fred, isn't it too bad,\r\nthat there are so many things--\" She broke off with a shake of the head.\r\n\r\n\"My dear girl, if I could bridge over the agony between now and Friday\r\nfor you--But you know the rules of the game; why torment yourself? You\r\nsaw the other night that you had the part under your thumb. Now walk,\r\nsleep, play with Archie, keep your tiger hungry, and she'll spring all\r\nright on Friday. I'll be there to see her, and there'll be more than I,\r\nI suspect. Harsanyi's on the Wilhelm der Grosse; gets in on Thursday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Harsanyi?\" Thea's eye lighted. \"I haven't seen him for years. We always\r\nmiss each other.\" She paused, hesitating. \"Yes, I should like that. But\r\nhe'll be busy, maybe?\"\r\n\r\n\"He gives his first concert at Carnegie Hall, week after next. Better\r\nsend him a box if you can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'll manage it.\" Thea took his hand again. \"Oh, I should like\r\nthat, Fred!\" she added impulsively. \"Even if I were put out, he'd get\r\nthe idea,\"--she threw back her head,--\"for there is an idea!\"\r\n\r\n\"Which won't penetrate here,\" he tapped his brow and began to laugh.\r\n\"You are an ungrateful huzzy, COMME LES AUTRES!\"\r\n\r\nThea detained him as he turned away. She pulled a flower out of a\r\nbouquet on the piano and absently drew the stem through the lapel of his\r\ncoat. \"I shall be walking in the Park to-morrow afternoon, on the\r\nreservoir path, between four and five, if you care to join me. You know\r\nthat after Harsanyi I'd rather please you than anyone else. You know a\r\nlot, but he knows even more than you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. Don't try to analyze it. SCHLAFEN SIE WOHL!\" he kissed her\r\nfingers and waved from the door, closing it behind him.\r\n\r\n\"He's the right sort, Thea.\" Dr. Archie looked warmly after his\r\ndisappearing friend. \"I've always hoped you'd make it up with Fred.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, haven't I? Oh, marry him, you mean! Perhaps it may come about,\r\nsome day. Just at present he's not in the marriage market any more than\r\nI am, is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I suppose not. It's a damned shame that a man like Ottenburg should\r\nbe tied up as he is, wasting all the best years of his life. A woman\r\nwith general paresis ought to be legally dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't let us talk about Fred's wife, please. He had no business to get\r\ninto such a mess, and he had no business to stay in it. He's always been\r\na softy where women were concerned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Most of us are, I'm afraid,\" Dr. Archie admitted meekly.\r\n\r\n\"Too much light in here, isn't there? Tires one's eyes. The stage lights\r\nare hard on mine.\" Thea began turning them out. \"We'll leave the little\r\none, over the piano.\" She sank down by Archie on the deep sofa. \"We two\r\nhave so much to talk about that we keep away from it altogether; have\r\nyou noticed? We don't even nibble the edges. I wish we had Landry here\r\nto-night to play for us. He's very comforting.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid you don't have enough personal life, outside your work,\r\nThea.\" The doctor looked at her anxiously.\r\n\r\nShe smiled at him with her eyes half closed. \"My dear doctor, I don't\r\nhave any. Your work becomes your personal life. You are not much good\r\nuntil it does. It's like being woven into a big web. You can't pull\r\naway, because all your little tendrils are woven into the picture. It\r\ntakes you up, and uses you, and spins you out; and that is your life.\r\nNot much else can happen to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you think of marrying, several years ago?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean Nordquist? Yes; but I changed my mind. We had been singing a\r\ngood deal together. He's a splendid creature.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you much in love with him, Thea?\" the doctor asked hopefully.\r\n\r\nShe smiled again. \"I don't think I know just what that expression means.\r\nI've never been able to find out. I think I was in love with you when I\r\nwas little, but not with any one since then. There are a great many ways\r\nof caring for people. It's not, after all, a simple state, like measles\r\nor tonsilitis. Nordquist is a taking sort of man. He and I were out in a\r\nrowboat once in a terrible storm. The lake was fed by glaciers,--ice\r\nwater,--and we couldn't have swum a stroke if the boat had filled. If we\r\nhadn't both been strong and kept our heads, we'd have gone down. We\r\npulled for every ounce there was in us, and we just got off with our\r\nlives. We were always being thrown together like that, under some kind\r\nof pressure. Yes, for a while I thought he would make everything right.\"\r\nShe paused and sank back, resting her head on a cushion, pressing her\r\neyelids down with her fingers. \"You see,\" she went on abruptly, \"he had\r\na wife and two children. He hadn't lived with her for several years, but\r\nwhen she heard that he wanted to marry again, she began to make trouble.\r\nHe earned a good deal of money, but he was careless and always\r\nwretchedly in debt. He came to me one day and told me he thought his\r\nwife would settle for a hundred thousand marks and consent to a divorce.\r\nI got very angry and sent him away. Next day he came back and said he\r\nthought she'd take fifty thousand.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie drew away from her, to the end of the sofa.\r\n\r\n\"Good God, Thea,\"--He ran his handkerchief over his forehead. \"What sort\r\nof people--\" He stopped and shook his head.\r\n\r\nThea rose and stood beside him, her hand on his shoulder. \"That's\r\nexactly how it struck me,\" she said quietly. \"Oh, we have things in\r\ncommon, things that go away back, under everything. You understand, of\r\ncourse. Nordquist didn't. He thought I wasn't willing to part with the\r\nmoney. I couldn't let myself buy him from Fru Nordquist, and he couldn't\r\nsee why. He had always thought I was close about money, so he attributed\r\nit to that. I am careful,\"--she ran her arm through Archie's and when he\r\nrose began to walk about the room with him. \"I can't be careless with\r\nmoney. I began the world on six hundred dollars, and it was the price of\r\na man's life. Ray Kennedy had worked hard and been sober and denied\r\nhimself, and when he died he had six hundred dollars to show for it. I\r\nalways measure things by that six hundred dollars, just as I measure\r\nhigh buildings by the Moonstone standpipe. There are standards we can't\r\nget away from.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Archie took her hand. \"I don't believe we should be any happier if\r\nwe did get away from them. I think it gives you some of your poise,\r\nhaving that anchor. You look,\" glancing down at her head and shoulders,\r\n\"sometimes so like your mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. You couldn't say anything nicer to me than that. On Friday\r\nafternoon, didn't you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but at other times, too. I love to see it. Do you know what I\r\nthought about that first night when I heard you sing? I kept remembering\r\nthe night I took care of you when you had pneumonia, when you were ten\r\nyears old. You were a terribly sick child, and I was a country doctor\r\nwithout much experience. There were no oxygen tanks about then. You\r\npretty nearly slipped away from me. If you had--\"\r\n\r\nThea dropped her head on his shoulder. \"I'd have saved myself and you a\r\nlot of trouble, wouldn't I? Dear Dr. Archie!\" she murmured.\r\n\r\n\"As for me, life would have been a pretty bleak stretch, with you left\r\nout.\" The doctor took one of the crystal pendants that hung from her\r\nshoulder and looked into it thoughtfully. \"I guess I'm a romantic old\r\nfellow, underneath. And you've always been my romance. Those years when\r\nyou were growing up were my happiest. When I dream about you, I always\r\nsee you as a little girl.\"\r\n\r\nThey paused by the open window. \"Do you? Nearly all my dreams, except\r\nthose about breaking down on the stage or missing trains, are about\r\nMoonstone. You tell me the old house has been pulled down, but it stands\r\nin my mind, every stick and timber. In my sleep I go all about it, and\r\nlook in the right drawers and cupboards for everything. I often dream\r\nthat I'm hunting for my rubbers in that pile of overshoes that was\r\nalways under the hatrack in the hall. I pick up every overshoe and know\r\nwhose it is, but I can't find my own. Then the school bell begins to\r\nring and I begin to cry. That's the house I rest in when I'm tired. All\r\nthe old furniture and the worn spots in the carpet--it rests my mind to\r\ngo over them.\"\r\n\r\nThey were looking out of the window. Thea kept his arm. Down on the\r\nriver four battleships were anchored in line, brilliantly lighted, and\r\nlaunches were coming and going, bringing the men ashore. A searchlight\r\nfrom one of the ironclads was playing on the great headland up the\r\nriver, where it makes its first resolute turn. Overhead the night-blue\r\nsky was intense and clear.\r\n\r\n\"There's so much that I want to tell you,\" she said at last, \"and it's\r\nhard to explain. My life is full of jealousies and disappointments, you\r\nknow. You get to hating people who do contemptible work and who get on\r\njust as well as you do. There are many disappointments in my profession,\r\nand bitter, bitter contempts!\" Her face hardened, and looked much older.\r\n\"If you love the good thing vitally, enough to give up for it all that\r\none must give up for it, then you must hate the cheap thing just as\r\nhard. I tell you, there is such a thing as creative hate! A contempt\r\nthat drives you through fire, makes you risk everything and lose\r\neverything, makes you a long sight better than you ever knew you could\r\nbe.\" As she glanced at Dr. Archie's face, Thea stopped short and turned\r\nher own face away. Her eyes followed the path of the searchlight up the\r\nriver and rested upon the illumined headland.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" she went on more calmly, \"voices are accidental things. You\r\nfind plenty of good voices in common women, with common minds and common\r\nhearts. Look at that woman who sang ORTRUDE with me last week. She's new\r\nhere and the people are wild about her. 'Such a beautiful volume of\r\ntone!' they say. I give you my word she's as stupid as an owl and as\r\ncoarse as a pig, and any one who knows anything about singing would see\r\nthat in an instant. Yet she's quite as popular as Necker, who's a great\r\nartist. How can I get much satisfaction out of the enthusiasm of a house\r\nthat likes her atrociously bad performance at the same time that it\r\npretends to like mine? If they like her, then they ought to hiss me off\r\nthe stage. We stand for things that are irreconcilable, absolutely. You\r\ncan't try to do things right and not despise the people who do them\r\nwrong. How can I be indifferent? If that doesn't matter, then nothing\r\nmatters. Well, sometimes I've come home as I did the other night when\r\nyou first saw me, so full of bitterness that it was as if my mind were\r\nfull of daggers. And I've gone to sleep and wakened up in the Kohlers'\r\ngarden, with the pigeons and the white rabbits, so happy! And that saves\r\nme.\" She sat down on the piano bench. Archie thought she had forgotten\r\nall about him, until she called his name. Her voice was soft now, and\r\nwonderfully sweet. It seemed to come from somewhere deep within her,\r\nthere were such strong vibrations in it. \"You see, Dr. Archie, what one\r\nreally strives for in art is not the sort of thing you are likely to\r\nfind when you drop in for a performance at the opera. What one strives\r\nfor is so far away, so deep, so beautiful\"--she lifted her shoulders\r\nwith a long breath, folded her hands in her lap and sat looking at him\r\nwith a resignation that made her face noble,--\"that there's nothing one\r\ncan say about it, Dr. Archie.\"\r\n\r\nWithout knowing very well what it was all about, Archie was passionately\r\nstirred for her. \"I've always believed in you, Thea; always believed,\"\r\nhe muttered.\r\n\r\nShe smiled and closed her eyes. \"They save me: the old things, things\r\nlike the Kohlers' garden. They are in everything I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what you sing, you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Not in any direct way,\"--she spoke hurriedly,--\"the light, the\r\ncolor, the feeling. Most of all the feeling. It comes in when I'm\r\nworking on a part, like the smell of a garden coming in at the window. I\r\ntry all the new things, and then go back to the old. Perhaps my feelings\r\nwere stronger then. A child's attitude toward everything is an artist's\r\nattitude. I am more or less of an artist now, but then I was nothing\r\nelse. When I went with you to Chicago that first time, I carried with me\r\nthe essentials, the foundation of all I do now. The point to which I\r\ncould go was scratched in me then. I haven't reached it yet, by a long\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\nArchie had a swift flash of memory. Pictures passed before him. \"You\r\nmean,\" he asked wonderingly, \"that you knew then that you were so\r\ngifted?\"\r\n\r\nThea looked up at him and smiled. \"Oh, I didn't know anything! Not\r\nenough to ask you for my trunk when I needed it. But you see, when I set\r\nout from Moonstone with you, I had had a rich, romantic past. I had\r\nlived a long, eventful life, and an artist's life, every hour of it.\r\nWagner says, in his most beautiful opera, that art is only a way of\r\nremembering youth. And the older we grow the more precious it seems to\r\nus, and the more richly we can present that memory. When we've got it\r\nall out,--the last, the finest thrill of it, the brightest hope of\r\nit,\"--she lifted her hand above her head and dropped it,--\"then we stop.\r\nWe do nothing but repeat after that. The stream has reached the level of\r\nits source. That's our measure.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a long, warm silence. Thea was looking hard at the floor, as\r\nif she were seeing down through years and years, and her old friend\r\nstood watching her bent head. His look was one with which he used to\r\nwatch her long ago, and which, even in thinking about her, had become a\r\nhabit of his face. It was full of solicitude, and a kind of secret\r\ngratitude, as if to thank her for some inexpressible pleasure of the\r\nheart. Thea turned presently toward the piano and began softly to waken\r\nan old air:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Ca' the yowes to the knowes,\r\n     Ca' them where the heather grows,\r\n     Ca' them where the burnie rowes,\r\n     My bonnie dear-ie.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nArchie sat down and shaded his eyes with his hand. She turned her head\r\nand spoke to him over her shoulder. \"Come on, you know the words better\r\nthan I. That's right.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We'll gae down by Clouden's side, Through the hazels spreading wide,\r\nO'er the waves that sweetly glide, To the moon sae clearly. Ghaist nor\r\nbogle shalt thou fear, Thou'rt to love and Heav'n sae dear, Nocht of ill\r\nmay come thee near, My bonnie dear-ie!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We can get on without Landry. Let's try it again, I have all the words\r\nnow. Then we'll have 'Sweet Afton.' Come: 'CA' THE YOWES TO THE\r\nKNOWES'--\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nOTTENBURG dismissed his taxicab at the 91st Street entrance of the Park\r\nand floundered across the drive through a wild spring snowstorm. When he\r\nreached the reservoir path he saw Thea ahead of him, walking rapidly\r\nagainst the wind. Except for that one figure, the path was deserted. A\r\nflock of gulls were hovering over the reservoir, seeming bewildered by\r\nthe driving currents of snow that whirled above the black water and then\r\ndisappeared within it. When he had almost overtaken Thea, Fred called to\r\nher, and she turned and waited for him with her back to the wind. Her\r\nhair and furs were powdered with snowflakes, and she looked like some\r\nrich-pelted animal, with warm blood, that had run in out of the woods.\r\nFred laughed as he took her hand.\r\n\r\n\"No use asking how you do. You surely needn't feel much anxiety about\r\nFriday, when you can look like this.\"\r\n\r\nShe moved close to the iron fence to make room for him beside her, and\r\nfaced the wind again. \"Oh, I'm WELL enough, in so far as that goes. But\r\nI'm not lucky about stage appearances. I'm easily upset, and the most\r\nperverse things happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter? Do you still get nervous?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I do. I don't mind nerves so much as getting numbed,\" Thea\r\nmuttered, sheltering her face for a moment with her muff. \"I'm under a\r\nspell, you know, hoodooed. It's the thing I WANT to do that I can never\r\ndo. Any other effects I can get easily enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you get effects, and not only with your voice. That's where you\r\nhave it over all the rest of them; you're as much at home on the stage\r\nas you were down in Panther Canyon--as if you'd just been let out of a\r\ncage. Didn't you get some of your ideas down there?\"\r\n\r\nThea nodded. \"Oh, yes! For heroic parts, at least. Out of the rocks, out\r\nof the dead people. You mean the idea of standing up under things, don't\r\nyou, meeting catastrophe? No fussiness. Seems to me they must have been\r\na reserved, somber people, with only a muscular language, all their\r\nmovements for a purpose; simple, strong, as if they were dealing with\r\nfate bare-handed.\" She put her gloved fingers on Fred's arm. \"I don't\r\nknow how I can ever thank you enough. I don't know if I'd ever have got\r\nanywhere without Panther Canyon. How did you know that was the one thing\r\nto do for me? It's the sort of thing nobody ever helps one to, in this\r\nworld. One can learn how to sing, but no singing teacher can give\r\nanybody what I got down there. How did you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know. Anything else would have done as well. It was your\r\ncreative hour. I knew you were getting a lot, but I didn't realize how\r\nmuch.\"\r\n\r\nThea walked on in silence. She seemed to be thinking.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what they really taught me?\" she came out suddenly. \"They\r\ntaught me the inevitable hardness of human life. No artist gets far who\r\ndoesn't know that. And you can't know it with your mind. You have to\r\nrealize it in your body, somehow; deep. It's an animal sort of feeling.\r\nI sometimes think it's the strongest of all. Do you know what I'm\r\ndriving at?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so. Even your audiences feel it, vaguely: that you've sometime\r\nor other faced things that make you different.\"\r\n\r\nThea turned her back to the wind, wiping away the snow that clung to her\r\nbrows and lashes. \"Ugh!\" she exclaimed; \"no matter how long a breath you\r\nhave, the storm has a longer. I haven't signed for next season, yet,\r\nFred. I'm holding out for a big contract: forty performances. Necker\r\nwon't be able to do much next winter. It's going to be one of those\r\nbetween seasons; the old singers are too old, and the new ones are too\r\nnew. They might as well risk me as anybody. So I want good terms. The\r\nnext five or six years are going to be my best.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll get what you demand, if you are uncompromising. I'm safe in\r\ncongratulating you now.\"\r\n\r\nThea laughed. \"It's a little early. I may not get it at all. They don't\r\nseem to be breaking their necks to meet me. I can go back to Dresden.\"\r\n\r\nAs they turned the curve and walked westward they got the wind from the\r\nside, and talking was easier.\r\n\r\nFred lowered his collar and shook the snow from his shoulders. \"Oh, I\r\ndon't mean on the contract particularly. I congratulate you on what you\r\ncan do, Thea, and on all that lies behind what you do. On the life\r\nthat's led up to it, and on being able to care so much. That, after all,\r\nis the unusual thing.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him sharply, with a certain apprehension. \"Care? Why\r\nshouldn't I care? If I didn't, I'd be in a bad way. What else have I\r\ngot?\" She stopped with a challenging interrogation, but Ottenburg did\r\nnot reply. \"You mean,\" she persisted, \"that you don't care as much as\r\nyou used to?\"\r\n\r\n\"I care about your success, of course.\" Fred fell into a slower pace.\r\nThea felt at once that he was talking seriously and had dropped the tone\r\nof half-ironical exaggeration he had used with her of late years. \"And\r\nI'm grateful to you for what you demand from yourself, when you might\r\nget off so easily. You demand more and more all the time, and you'll do\r\nmore and more. One is grateful to anybody for that; it makes life in\r\ngeneral a little less sordid. But as a matter of fact, I'm not much\r\ninterested in how anybody sings anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's too bad of you, when I'm just beginning to see what is worth\r\ndoing, and how I want to do it!\" Thea spoke in an injured tone.\r\n\r\n\"That's what I congratulate you on. That's the great difference between\r\nyour kind and the rest of us. It's how long you're able to keep it up\r\nthat tells the story. When you needed enthusiasm from the outside, I was\r\nable to give it to you. Now you must let me withdraw.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not tying you, am I?\" she flashed out. \"But withdraw to what? What\r\ndo you want?\"\r\n\r\nFred shrugged. \"I might ask you, What have I got? I want things that\r\nwouldn't interest you; that you probably wouldn't understand. For one\r\nthing, I want a son to bring up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can understand that. It seems to me reasonable. Have you also found\r\nsomebody you want to marry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not particularly.\" They turned another curve, which brought the wind to\r\ntheir backs, and they walked on in comparative calm, with the snow\r\nblowing past them. \"It's not your fault, Thea, but I've had you too much\r\nin my mind. I've not given myself a fair chance in other directions. I\r\nwas in Rome when you and Nordquist were there. If that had kept up, it\r\nmight have cured me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It might have cured a good many things,\" remarked Thea grimly.\r\n\r\nFred nodded sympathetically and went on. \"In my library in St. Louis,\r\nover the fireplace, I have a property spear I had copied from one in\r\nVenice,--oh, years ago, after you first went abroad, while you were\r\nstudying. You'll probably be singing BRUNNHILDE pretty soon now, and\r\nI'll send it on to you, if I may. You can take it and its history for\r\nwhat they're worth. But I'm nearly forty years old, and I've served my\r\nturn. You've done what I hoped for you, what I was honestly willing to\r\nlose you for--then. I'm older now, and I think I was an ass. I wouldn't\r\ndo it again if I had the chance, not much! But I'm not sorry. It takes a\r\ngreat many people to make one--BRUNNHILDE.\"\r\n\r\nThea stopped by the fence and looked over into the black choppiness on\r\nwhich the snowflakes fell and disappeared with magical rapidity. Her\r\nface was both angry and troubled. \"So you really feel I've been\r\nungrateful. I thought you sent me out to get something. I didn't know\r\nyou wanted me to bring in something easy. I thought you wanted\r\nsomething--\" She took a deep breath and shrugged her shoulders. \"But\r\nthere! nobody on God's earth wants it, REALLY! If one other person\r\nwanted it,\"--she thrust her hand out before him and clenched it,--\"my\r\nGod, what I could do!\"\r\n\r\nFred laughed dismally. \"Even in my ashes I feel myself pushing you! How\r\ncan anybody help it? My dear girl, can't you see that anybody else who\r\nwanted it as you do would be your rival, your deadliest danger? Can't\r\nyou see that it's your great good fortune that other people can't care\r\nabout it so much?\"\r\n\r\nBut Thea seemed not to take in his protest at all. She went on\r\nvindicating herself. \"It's taken me a long while to do anything, of\r\ncourse, and I've only begun to see daylight. But anything good\r\nis--expensive. It hasn't seemed long. I've always felt responsible to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nFred looked at her face intently, through the veil of snowflakes, and\r\nshook his head. \"To me? You are a truthful woman, and you don't mean to\r\nlie to me. But after the one responsibility you do feel, I doubt if\r\nyou've enough left to feel responsible to God! Still, if you've ever in\r\nan idle hour fooled yourself with thinking I had anything to do with it,\r\nHeaven knows I'm grateful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even if I'd married Nordquist,\" Thea went on, turning down the path\r\nagain, \"there would have been something left out. There always is. In a\r\nway, I've always been married to you. I'm not very flexible; never was\r\nand never shall be. You caught me young. I could never have that over\r\nagain. One can't, after one begins to know anything. But I look back on\r\nit. My life hasn't been a gay one, any more than yours. If I shut things\r\nout from you, you shut them out from me. We've been a help and a\r\nhindrance to each other. I guess it's always that way, the good and the\r\nbad all mixed up. There's only one thing that's all beautiful--and\r\nalways beautiful! That's why my interest keeps up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know.\" Fred looked sidewise at the outline of her head against\r\nthe thickening atmosphere. \"And you give one the impression that that is\r\nenough. I've gradually, gradually given you up.\"\r\n\r\n\"See, the lights are coming out.\" Thea pointed to where they flickered,\r\nflashes of violet through the gray tree-tops. Lower down the globes\r\nalong the drives were becoming a pale lemon color. \"Yes, I don't see why\r\nanybody wants to marry an artist, anyhow. I remember Ray Kennedy used to\r\nsay he didn't see how any woman could marry a gambler, for she would\r\nonly be marrying what the game left.\" She shook her shoulders\r\nimpatiently. \"Who marries who is a small matter, after all. But I hope I\r\ncan bring back your interest in my work. You've cared longer and more\r\nthan anybody else, and I'd like to have somebody human to make a report\r\nto once in a while. You can send me your spear. I'll do my best. If\r\nyou're not interested, I'll do my best anyhow. I've only a few friends,\r\nbut I can lose every one of them, if it has to be. I learned how to lose\r\nwhen my mother died.--We must hurry now. My taxi must be waiting.\"\r\n\r\nThe blue light about them was growing deeper and darker, and the falling\r\nsnow and the faint trees had become violet. To the south, over Broadway,\r\nthere was an orange reflection in the clouds. Motors and carriage lights\r\nflashed by on the drive below the reservoir path, and the air was\r\nstrident with horns and shrieks from the whistles of the mounted\r\npolicemen.\r\n\r\nFred gave Thea his arm as they descended from the embankment. \"I guess\r\nyou'll never manage to lose me or Archie, Thea. You do pick up queer\r\nones. But loving you is a heroic discipline. It wears a man out. Tell me\r\none thing: could I have kept you, once, if I'd put on every screw?\"\r\n\r\nThea hurried him along, talking rapidly, as if to get it over. \"You\r\nmight have kept me in misery for a while, perhaps. I don't know. I have\r\nto think well of myself, to work. You could have made it hard. I'm not\r\nungrateful. I was a difficult proposition to deal with. I understand\r\nnow, of course. Since you didn't tell me the truth in the beginning, you\r\ncouldn't very well turn back after I'd set my head. At least, if you'd\r\nbeen the sort who could, you wouldn't have had to,--for I'd not have\r\ncared a button for that sort, even then.\" She stopped beside a car that\r\nwaited at the curb and gave him her hand. \"There. We part friends?\"\r\n\r\nFred looked at her. \"You know. Ten years.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not ungrateful,\" Thea repeated as she got into her cab.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she reflected, as the taxi cut into the Park carriage road, \"we\r\ndon't get fairy tales in this world, and he has, after all, cared more\r\nand longer than anybody else.\" It was dark outside now, and the light\r\nfrom the lamps along the drive flashed into the cab. The snowflakes\r\nhovered like swarms of white bees about the globes.\r\n\r\nThea sat motionless in one corner staring out of the window at the cab\r\nlights that wove in and out among the trees, all seeming to be bent upon\r\njoyous courses. Taxicabs were still new in New York, and the theme of\r\npopular minstrelsy. Landry had sung her a ditty he heard in some theater\r\non Third Avenue, about:\r\n\r\n\"But there passed him a bright-eyed taxi\r\nWith the girl of his heart inside.\"\r\n\r\nAlmost inaudibly Thea began to hum the air, though she was thinking of\r\nsomething serious, something that had touched her deeply. At the\r\nbeginning of the season, when she was not singing often, she had gone\r\none afternoon to hear Paderewski's recital. In front of her sat an old\r\nGerman couple, evidently poor people who had made sacrifices to pay for\r\ntheir excellent seats. Their intelligent enjoyment of the music, and\r\ntheir friendliness with each other, had interested her more than\r\nanything on the programme. When the pianist began a lovely melody in the\r\nfirst movement of the Beethoven D minor sonata, the old lady put out her\r\nplump hand and touched her husband's sleeve and they looked at each\r\nother in recognition. They both wore glasses, but such a look! Like\r\nforget-menots, and so full of happy recollections. Thea wanted to put\r\nher arms around them and ask them how they had been able to keep a\r\nfeeling like that, like a nosegay in a glass of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nDR. ARCHIE saw nothing of Thea during the following week. After several\r\nfruitless efforts, he succeeded in getting a word with her over the\r\ntelephone, but she sounded so distracted and driven that he was glad to\r\nsay good-night and hang up the instrument. There were, she told him,\r\nrehearsals not only for \"Walkure,\" but also for \"Gotterdammerung,\" in\r\nwhich she was to sing WALTRAUTE two weeks later.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday afternoon Thea got home late, after an exhausting rehearsal.\r\nShe was in no happy frame of mind. Madame Necker, who had been very\r\ngracious to her that night when she went on to complete Gloeckler's\r\nperformance of SIEGLINDE, had, since Thea was cast to sing the part\r\ninstead of Gloeckler in the production of the \"Ring,\" been chilly and\r\ndisapproving, distinctly hostile. Thea had always felt that she and\r\nNecker stood for the same sort of endeavor, and that Necker recognized\r\nit and had a cordial feeling for her. In Germany she had several times\r\nsung BRANGAENA to Necker's ISOLDE, and the older artist had let her know\r\nthat she thought she sang it beautifully. It was a bitter disappointment\r\nto find that the approval of so honest an artist as Necker could not\r\nstand the test of any significant recognition by the management. Madame\r\nNecker was forty, and her voice was failing just when her powers were at\r\ntheir height. Every fresh young voice was an enemy, and this one was\r\naccompanied by gifts which she could not fail to recognize.\r\n\r\nThea had her dinner sent up to her apartment, and it was a very poor\r\none. She tasted the soup and then indignantly put on her wraps to go out\r\nand hunt a dinner. As she was going to the elevator, she had to admit\r\nthat she was behaving foolishly. She took off her hat and coat and\r\nordered another dinner. When it arrived, it was no better than the\r\nfirst. There was even a burnt match under the milk toast. She had a sore\r\nthroat, which made swallowing painful and boded ill for the morrow.\r\nAlthough she had been speaking in whispers all day to save her throat,\r\nshe now perversely summoned the housekeeper and demanded an account of\r\nsome laundry that had been lost. The housekeeper was indifferent and\r\nimpertinent, and Thea got angry and scolded violently. She knew it was\r\nvery bad for her to get into a rage just before bedtime, and after the\r\nhousekeeper left she realized that for ten dollars' worth of\r\nunderclothing she had been unfitting herself for a performance which\r\nmight eventually mean many thousands. The best thing now was to stop\r\nreproaching herself for her lack of sense, but she was too tired to\r\ncontrol her thoughts.\r\n\r\nWhile she was undressing--Therese was brushing out her SIEGLINDE wig in\r\nthe trunk-room--she went on chiding herself bitterly. \"And how am I ever\r\ngoing to get to sleep in this state?\" she kept asking herself. \"If I\r\ndon't sleep, I'll be perfectly worthless to-morrow. I'll go down there\r\nto-morrow and make a fool of myself. If I'd let that laundry alone with\r\nwhatever nigger has stolen it--WHY did I undertake to reform the\r\nmanagement of this hotel to-night? After to-morrow I could pack up and\r\nleave the place. There's the Phillamon--I liked the rooms there better,\r\nanyhow--and the Umberto--\" She began going over the advantages and\r\ndisadvantages of different apartment hotels. Suddenly she checked\r\nherself. \"What AM I doing this for? I can't move into another hotel\r\nto-night. I'll keep this up till morning. I shan't sleep a wink.\"\r\n\r\nShould she take a hot bath, or shouldn't she? Sometimes it relaxed her,\r\nand sometimes it roused her and fairly put her beside herself. Between\r\nthe conviction that she must sleep and the fear that she couldn't, she\r\nhung paralyzed. When she looked at her bed, she shrank from it in every\r\nnerve. She was much more afraid of it than she had ever been of the\r\nstage of any opera house. It yawned before her like the sunken road at\r\nWaterloo.\r\n\r\nShe rushed into her bathroom and locked the door. She would risk the\r\nbath, and defer the encounter with the bed a little longer. She lay in\r\nthe bath half an hour. The warmth of the water penetrated to her bones,\r\ninduced pleasant reflections and a feeling of well-being. It was very\r\nnice to have Dr. Archie in New York, after all, and to see him get so\r\nmuch satisfaction out of the little companionship she was able to give\r\nhim. She liked people who got on, and who became more interesting as\r\nthey grew older. There was Fred; he was much more interesting now than\r\nhe had been at thirty. He was intelligent about music, and he must be\r\nvery intelligent in his business, or he would not be at the head of the\r\nBrewers' Trust. She respected that kind of intelligence and success. Any\r\nsuccess was good. She herself had made a good start, at any rate, and\r\nnow, if she could get to sleep--Yes, they were all more interesting than\r\nthey used to be. Look at Harsanyi, who had been so long retarded; what a\r\nplace he had made for himself in Vienna. If she could get to sleep, she\r\nwould show him something to-morrow that he would understand.\r\n\r\nShe got quickly into bed and moved about freely between the sheets. Yes,\r\nshe was warm all over. A cold, dry breeze was coming in from the river,\r\nthank goodness! She tried to think about her little rock house and the\r\nArizona sun and the blue sky. But that led to memories which were still\r\ntoo disturbing. She turned on her side, closed her eyes, and tried an\r\nold device.\r\n\r\nShe entered her father's front door, hung her hat and coat on the rack,\r\nand stopped in the parlor to warm her hands at the stove. Then she went\r\nout through the diningroom, where the boys were getting their lessons at\r\nthe long table; through the sitting-room, where Thor was asleep in his\r\ncot bed, his dress and stocking hanging on a chair. In the kitchen she\r\nstopped for her lantern and her hot brick. She hurried up the back\r\nstairs and through the windy loft to her own glacial room. The illusion\r\nwas marred only by the consciousness that she ought to brush her teeth\r\nbefore she went to bed, and that she never used to do it. Why--? The\r\nwater was frozen solid in the pitcher, so she got over that. Once\r\nbetween the red blankets there was a short, fierce battle with the cold;\r\nthen, warmer--warmer. She could hear her father shaking down the\r\nhard-coal burner for the night, and the wind rushing and banging down\r\nthe village street. The boughs of the cottonwood, hard as bone, rattled\r\nagainst her gable. The bed grew softer and warmer. Everybody was warm\r\nand well downstairs. The sprawling old house had gathered them all in,\r\nlike a hen, and had settled down over its brood. They were all warm in\r\nher father's house. Softer and softer. She was asleep. She slept ten\r\nhours without turning over. From sleep like that, one awakes in shining\r\narmor.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Friday afternoon there was an inspiring audience; there was not an\r\nempty chair in the house. Ottenburg and Dr. Archie had seats in the\r\norchestra circle, got from a ticket broker. Landry had not been able to\r\nget a seat, so he roamed about in the back of the house, where he\r\nusually stood when he dropped in after his own turn in vaudeville was\r\nover. He was there so often and at such irregular hours that the ushers\r\nthought he was a singer's husband, or had something to do with the\r\nelectrical plant.\r\n\r\nHarsanyi and his wife were in a box, near the stage, in the second\r\ncircle. Mrs. Harsanyi's hair was noticeably gray, but her face was\r\nfuller and handsomer than in those early years of struggle, and she was\r\nbeautifully dressed. Harsanyi himself had changed very little. He had\r\nput on his best afternoon coat in honor of his pupil, and wore a pearl\r\nin his black ascot. His hair was longer and more bushy than he used to\r\nwear it, and there was now one gray lock on the right side. He had\r\nalways been an elegant figure, even when he went about in shabby clothes\r\nand was crushed with work. Before the curtain rose he was restless and\r\nnervous, and kept looking at his watch and wishing he had got a few more\r\nletters off before he left his hotel. He had not been in New York since\r\nthe advent of the taxicab, and had allowed himself too much time. His\r\nwife knew that he was afraid of being disappointed this afternoon. He\r\ndid not often go to the opera because the stupid things that singers did\r\nvexed him so, and it always put him in a rage if the conductor held the\r\ntempo or in any way accommodated the score to the singer.\r\n\r\nWhen the lights went out and the violins began to quaver their long D\r\nagainst the rude figure of the basses, Mrs. Harsanyi saw her husband's\r\nfingers fluttering on his knee in a rapid tattoo. At the moment when\r\nSIEGLINDE entered from the side door, she leaned toward him and\r\nwhispered in his ear, \"Oh, the lovely creature!\" But he made no\r\nresponse, either by voice or gesture. Throughout the first scene he sat\r\nsunk in his chair, his head forward and his one yellow eye rolling\r\nrestlessly and shining like a tiger's in the dark. His eye followed\r\nSIEGLINDE about the stage like a satellite, and as she sat at the table\r\nlistening to SIEGMUND'S long narrative, it never left her. When she\r\nprepared the sleeping draught and disappeared after HUNDING, Harsanyi\r\nbowed his head still lower and put his hand over his eye to rest it. The\r\ntenor,--a young man who sang with great vigor, went on:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"WALSE! WALSE! WO IST DEIN SCHWERT?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHarsanyi smiled, but he did not look forth again until SIEGLINDE\r\nreappeared. She went through the story of her shameful bridal feast and\r\ninto the Walhall' music, which she always sang so nobly, and the\r\nentrance of the one-eyed stranger:--\r\n\r\n\"MIR ALLEIN WECKTE DAS AUGE.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Harsanyi glanced at her husband, wondering whether the singer on\r\nthe stage could not feel his commanding glance. On came the CRESCENDO:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"WAS JE ICH VERLOR, WAS JE ICH BEWEINT WAR' MIR GEWONNEN.\"\r\n\r\n(All that I have lost, All that I have mourned, Would I then have won.)\r\n\r\nHarsanyi touched his wife's arm softly.\r\n\r\nSeated in the moonlight, the VOLSUNG pair began their loving inspection\r\nof each other's beauties, and the music born of murmuring sound passed\r\ninto her face, as the old poet said,--and into her body as well. Into\r\none lovely attitude after another the music swept her, love impelled\r\nher. And the voice gave out all that was best in it. Like the spring,\r\nindeed, it blossomed into memories and prophecies, it recounted and it\r\nforetold, as she sang the story of her friendless life, and of how the\r\nthing which was truly herself, \"bright as the day, rose to the surface\"\r\nwhen in the hostile world she for the first time beheld her Friend.\r\nFervently she rose into the hardier feeling of action and daring, the\r\npride in hero-strength and hero-blood, until in a splendid burst, tall\r\nand shining like a Victory, she christened him:--\r\n\r\n\"SIEGMUND--SO NENN ICH DICH!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHer impatience for the sword swelled with her anticipation of his act,\r\nand throwing her arms above her head, she fairly tore a sword out of the\r\nempty air for him, before NOTHUNG had left the tree. IN HOCHSTER\r\nTRUNKENHEIT, indeed, she burst out with the flaming cry of their\r\nkinship: \"If you are SIEGMUND, I am SIEGLINDE!\" Laughing, singing,\r\nbounding, exulting,--with their passion and their sword,--the VOLSUNGS\r\nran out into the spring night.\r\n\r\nAs the curtain fell, Harsanyi turned to his wife. \"At last,\" he sighed,\r\n\"somebody with ENOUGH! Enough voice and talent and beauty, enough\r\nphysical power. And such a noble, noble style!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can scarcely believe it, Andor. I can see her now, that clumsy girl,\r\nhunched up over your piano. I can see her shoulders. She always seemed\r\nto labor so with her back. And I shall never forget that night when you\r\nfound her voice.\"\r\n\r\nThe audience kept up its clamor until, after many reappearances with the\r\ntenor, Kronborg came before the curtain alone. The house met her with a\r\nroar, a greeting that was almost savage in its fierceness. The singer's\r\neyes, sweeping the house, rested for a moment on Harsanyi, and she waved\r\nher long sleeve toward his box.\r\n\r\n\"She OUGHT to be pleased that you are here,\" said Mrs. Harsanyi. \"I\r\nwonder if she knows how much she owes to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"She owes me nothing,\" replied her husband quickly. \"She paid her way.\r\nShe always gave something back, even then.\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember you said once that she would do nothing common,\" said Mrs.\r\nHarsanyi thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Just so. She might fail, die, get lost in the pack. But if she\r\nachieved, it would be nothing common. There are people whom one can\r\ntrust for that. There is one way in which they will never fail.\"\r\nHarsanyi retired into his own reflections.\r\n\r\nAfter the second act Fred Ottenburg brought Archie to the Harsanyis' box\r\nand introduced him as an old friend of Miss Kronborg. The head of a\r\nmusical publishing house joined them, bringing with him a journalist and\r\nthe president of a German singing society. The conversation was chiefly\r\nabout the new SIEGLINDE. Mrs. Harsanyi was gracious and enthusiastic,\r\nher husband nervous and uncommunicative. He smiled mechanically, and\r\npolitely answered questions addressed to him. \"Yes, quite so.\" \"Oh,\r\ncertainly.\" Every one, of course, said very usual things with great\r\nconviction. Mrs. Harsanyi was used to hearing and uttering the\r\ncommonplaces which such occasions demanded. When her husband withdrew\r\ninto the shadow, she covered his retreat by her sympathy and cordiality.\r\nIn reply to a direct question from Ottenburg, Harsanyi said, flinching,\r\n\"ISOLDE? Yes, why not? She will sing all the great roles, I should\r\nthink.\"\r\n\r\nThe chorus director said something about \"dramatic temperament.\" The\r\njournalist insisted that it was \"explosive force,\" \"projecting power.\"\r\n\r\nOttenburg turned to Harsanyi. \"What is it, Mr. Harsanyi? Miss Kronborg\r\nsays if there is anything in her, you are the man who can say what it\r\nis.\"\r\n\r\nThe journalist scented copy and was eager. \"Yes, Harsanyi. You know all\r\nabout her. What's her secret?\"\r\n\r\nHarsanyi rumpled his hair irritably and shrugged his shoulders. \"Her\r\nsecret? It is every artist's secret,\"--he waved his hand,--\"passion.\r\nThat is all. It is an open secret, and perfectly safe. Like heroism, it\r\nis inimitable in cheap materials.\"\r\n\r\nThe lights went out. Fred and Archie left the box as the second act came\r\non.\r\n\r\nArtistic growth is, more than it is anything else, a refining of the\r\nsense of truthfulness. The stupid believe that to be truthful is easy;\r\nonly the artist, the great artist, knows how difficult it is. That\r\nafternoon nothing new came to Thea Kronborg, no enlightenment, no\r\ninspiration. She merely came into full possession of things she had been\r\nrefining and perfecting for so long. Her inhibitions chanced to be fewer\r\nthan usual, and, within herself, she entered into the inheritance that\r\nshe herself had laid up, into the fullness of the faith she had kept\r\nbefore she knew its name or its meaning.\r\n\r\nOften when she sang, the best she had was unavailable; she could not\r\nbreak through to it, and every sort of distraction and mischance came\r\nbetween it and her. But this afternoon the closed roads opened, the\r\ngates dropped. What she had so often tried to reach, lay under her hand.\r\nShe had only to touch an idea to make it live.\r\n\r\nWhile she was on the stage she was conscious that every movement was the\r\nright movement, that her body was absolutely the instrument of her idea.\r\nNot for nothing had she kept it so severely, kept it filled with such\r\nenergy and fire. All that deep-rooted vitality flowered in her voice,\r\nher face, in her very finger-tips. She felt like a tree bursting into\r\nbloom. And her voice was as flexible as her body; equal to any demand,\r\ncapable of every NUANCE. With the sense of its perfect companionship,\r\nits entire trustworthiness, she had been able to throw herself into the\r\ndramatic exigencies of the part, everything in her at its best and\r\neverything working together.\r\n\r\nThe third act came on, and the afternoon slipped by. Thea Kronborg's\r\nfriends, old and new, seated about the house on different floors and\r\nlevels, enjoyed her triumph according to their natures. There was one\r\nthere, whom nobody knew, who perhaps got greater pleasure out of that\r\nafternoon than Harsanyi himself. Up in the top gallery a gray-haired\r\nlittle Mexican, withered and bright as a string of peppers beside a'dobe\r\ndoor, kept praying and cursing under his breath, beating on the brass\r\nrailing and shouting \"Bravo! Bravo!\" until he was repressed by his\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\nHe happened to be there because a Mexican band was to be a feature of\r\nBarnum and Bailey's circus that year. One of the managers of the show\r\nhad traveled about the Southwest, signing up a lot of Mexican musicians\r\nat low wages, and had brought them to New York. Among them was Spanish\r\nJohnny. After Mrs. Tellamantez died, Johnny abandoned his trade and went\r\nout with his mandolin to pick up a living for one. His irregularities\r\nhad become his regular mode of life.\r\n\r\nWhen Thea Kronborg came out of the stage entrance on Fortieth Street,\r\nthe sky was still flaming with the last rays of the sun that was sinking\r\noff behind the North River. A little crowd of people was lingering about\r\nthe door--musicians from the orchestra who were waiting for their\r\ncomrades, curious young men, and some poorly dressed girls who were\r\nhoping to get a glimpse of the singer. She bowed graciously to the\r\ngroup, through her veil, but she did not look to the right or left as\r\nshe crossed the sidewalk to her cab. Had she lifted her eyes an instant\r\nand glanced out through her white scarf, she must have seen the only man\r\nin the crowd who had removed his hat when she emerged, and who stood\r\nwith it crushed up in his hand. And she would have known him, changed as\r\nhe was. His lustrous black hair was full of gray, and his face was a\r\ngood deal worn by the EXTASI, so that it seemed to have shrunk away from\r\nhis shining eyes and teeth and left them too prominent. But she would\r\nhave known him. She passed so near that he could have touched her, and\r\nhe did not put on his hat until her taxi had snorted away. Then he\r\nwalked down Broadway with his hands in his overcoat pockets, wearing a\r\nsmile which embraced all the stream of life that passed him and the\r\nlighted towers that rose into the limpid blue of the evening sky. If the\r\nsinger, going home exhausted in her cab, was wondering what was the good\r\nof it all, that smile, could she have seen it, would have answered her.\r\nIt is the only commensurate answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we must leave Thea Kronborg. From this time on the story of her\r\nlife is the story of her achievement. The growth of an artist is an\r\nintellectual and spiritual development which can scarcely be followed in\r\na personal narrative. This story attempts to deal only with the simple\r\nand concrete beginnings which color and accent an artist's work, and to\r\ngive some account of how a Moonstone girl found her way out of a vague,\r\neasy-going world into a life of disciplined endeavor. Any account of the\r\nloyalty of young hearts to some exalted ideal, and the passion with\r\nwhich they strive, will always, in some of us, rekindle generous\r\nemotions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE\r\n\r\nMOONSTONE again, in the year 1909. The Methodists are giving an\r\nice-cream sociable in the grove about the new court-house. It is a warm\r\nsummer night of full moon. The paper lanterns which hang among the trees\r\nare foolish toys, only dimming, in little lurid circles, the great\r\nsoftness of the lunar light that floods the blue heavens and the high\r\nplateau. To the east the sand hills shine white as of old, but the\r\nempire of the sand is gradually diminishing. The grass grows thicker\r\nover the dunes than it used to, and the streets of the town are harder\r\nand firmer than they were twenty-five years ago. The old inhabitants\r\nwill tell you that sandstorms are infrequent now, that the wind blows\r\nless persistently in the spring and plays a milder tune. Cultivation has\r\nmodified the soil and the climate, as it modifies human life.\r\n\r\nThe people seated about under the cottonwoods are much smarter than the\r\nMethodists we used to know. The interior of the new Methodist Church\r\nlooks like a theater, with a sloping floor, and as the congregation\r\nproudly say, \"opera chairs.\" The matrons who attend to serving the\r\nrefreshments to-night look younger for their years than did the women of\r\nMrs. Kronborg's time, and the children all look like city children. The\r\nlittle boys wear \"Buster Browns\" and the little girls Russian blouses.\r\nThe country child, in made-overs and cut-downs, seems to have vanished\r\nfrom the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nAt one of the tables, with her Dutch-cut twin boys, sits a fair-haired,\r\ndimpled matron who was once Lily Fisher. Her husband is president of the\r\nnew bank, and she \"goes East for her summers,\" a practice which causes\r\nenvy and discontent among her neighbors. The twins are well-behaved\r\nchildren, biddable, meek, neat about their clothes, and always mindful\r\nof the proprieties they have learned at summer hotels. While they are\r\neating their icecream and trying not to twist the spoon in their mouths,\r\na little shriek of laughter breaks from an adjacent table. The twins\r\nlook up. There sits a spry little old spinster whom they know well. She\r\nhas a long chin, a long nose, and she is dressed like a young girl, with\r\na pink sash and a lace garden hat with pink rosebuds. She is surrounded\r\nby a crowd of boys,--loose and lanky, short and thick,--who are joking\r\nwith her roughly, but not unkindly.\r\n\r\n\"Mamma,\" one of the twins comes out in a shrill treble, \"why is Tillie\r\nKronborg always talking about a thousand dollars?\"\r\n\r\nThe boys, hearing this question, break into a roar of laughter, the\r\nwomen titter behind their paper napkins, and even from Tillie there is a\r\nlittle shriek of appreciation. The observing child's remark had made\r\nevery one suddenly realize that Tillie never stopped talking about that\r\nparticular sum of money. In the spring, when she went to buy early\r\nstrawberries, and was told that they were thirty cents a box, she was\r\nsure to remind the grocer that though her name was Kronborg she didn't\r\nget a thousand dollars a night. In the autumn, when she went to buy her\r\ncoal for the winter, she expressed amazement at the price quoted her,\r\nand told the dealer he must have got her mixed up with her niece to\r\nthink she could pay such a sum. When she was making her Christmas\r\npresents, she never failed to ask the women who came into her shop what\r\nyou COULD make for anybody who got a thousand dollars a night. When the\r\nDenver papers announced that Thea Kronborg had married Frederick\r\nOttenburg, the head of the Brewers' Trust, Moonstone people expected\r\nthat Tillie's vain-gloriousness would take another form. But Tillie had\r\nhoped that Thea would marry a title, and she did not boast much about\r\nOttenburg,--at least not until after her memorable trip to Kansas City\r\nto hear Thea sing.\r\n\r\nTillie is the last Kronborg left in Moonstone. She lives alone in a\r\nlittle house with a green yard, and keeps a fancywork and millinery\r\nstore. Her business methods are informal, and she would never come out\r\neven at the end of the year, if she did not receive a draft for a good\r\nround sum from her niece at Christmas time. The arrival of this draft\r\nalways renews the discussion as to what Thea would do for her aunt if\r\nshe really did the right thing. Most of the Moonstone people think Thea\r\nought to take Tillie to New York and keep her as a companion. While they\r\nare feeling sorry for Tillie because she does not live at the Plaza,\r\nTillie is trying not to hurt their feelings by showing too plainly how\r\nmuch she realizes the superiority of her position. She tries to be\r\nmodest when she complains to the postmaster that her New York paper is\r\nmore than three days late. It means enough, surely, on the face of it,\r\nthat she is the only person in Moonstone who takes a New York paper or\r\nwho has any reason for taking one. A foolish young girl, Tillie lived in\r\nthe splendid sorrows of \"Wanda\" and \"Strathmore\"; a foolish old girl,\r\nshe lives in her niece's triumphs. As she often says, she just missed\r\ngoing on the stage herself.\r\n\r\nThat night after the sociable, as Tillie tripped home with a crowd of\r\nnoisy boys and girls, she was perhaps a shade troubled. The twin's\r\nquestion rather lingered in her ears. Did she, perhaps, insist too much\r\non that thousand dollars? Surely, people didn't for a minute think it\r\nwas the money she cared about? As for that, Tillie tossed her head, she\r\ndidn't care a rap. They must understand that this money was different.\r\n\r\nWhen the laughing little group that brought her home had gone weaving\r\ndown the sidewalk through the leafy shadows and had disappeared, Tillie\r\nbrought out a rocking chair and sat down on her porch. On glorious, soft\r\nsummer nights like this, when the moon is opulent and full, the day\r\nsubmerged and forgotten, she loves to sit there behind her rose-vine and\r\nlet her fancy wander where it will. If you chanced to be passing down\r\nthat Moonstone street and saw that alert white figure rocking there\r\nbehind the screen of roses and lingering late into the night, you might\r\nfeel sorry for her, and how mistaken you would be! Tillie lives in a\r\nlittle magic world, full of secret satisfactions. Thea Kronborg has\r\ngiven much noble pleasure to a world that needs all it can get, but to\r\nno individual has she given more than to her queer old aunt in\r\nMoonstone. The legend of Kronborg, the artist, fills Tillie's life; she\r\nfeels rich and exalted in it. What delightful things happen in her mind\r\nas she sits there rocking! She goes back to those early days of sand and\r\nsun, when Thea was a child and Tillie was herself, so it seems to her,\r\n\"young.\" When she used to hurry to church to hear Mr. Kronborg's\r\nwonderful sermons, and when Thea used to stand up by the organ of a\r\nbright Sunday morning and sing \"Come, Ye Disconsolate.\" Or she thinks\r\nabout that wonderful time when the Metropolitan Opera Company sang a\r\nweek's engagement in Kansas City, and Thea sent for her and had her stay\r\nwith her at the Coates House and go to every performance at Convention\r\nHall. Thea let Tillie go through her costume trunks and try on her wigs\r\nand jewels. And the kindness of Mr. Ottenburg! When Thea dined in her\r\nown room, he went down to dinner with Tillie, and never looked bored or\r\nabsent-minded when she chattered. He took her to the hall the first time\r\nThea sang there, and sat in the box with her and helped her through\r\n\"Lohengrin.\" After the first act, when Tillie turned tearful eyes to him\r\nand burst out, \"I don't care, she always seemed grand like that, even\r\nwhen she was a girl. I expect I'm crazy, but she just seems to me full\r\nof all them old times!\"--Ottenburg was so sympathetic and patted her\r\nhand and said, \"But that's just what she is, full of the old times, and\r\nyou are a wise woman to see it.\" Yes, he said that to her. Tillie often\r\nwondered how she had been able to bear it when Thea came down the stairs\r\nin the wedding robe embroidered in silver, with a train so long it took\r\nsix women to carry it.\r\n\r\nTillie had lived fifty-odd years for that week, but she got it, and no\r\nmiracle was ever more miraculous than that. When she used to be working\r\nin the fields on her father's Minnesota farm, she couldn't help\r\nbelieving that she would some day have to do with the \"wonderful,\"\r\nthough her chances for it had then looked so slender.\r\n\r\nThe morning after the sociable, Tillie, curled up in bed, was roused by\r\nthe rattle of the milk cart down the street. Then a neighbor boy came\r\ndown the sidewalk outside her window, singing \"Casey Jones\" as if he\r\nhadn't a care in the world. By this time Tillie was wide awake. The\r\ntwin's question, and the subsequent laughter, came back with a faint\r\ntwinge. Tillie knew she was short-sighted about facts, but this\r\ntime--Why, there were her scrapbooks, full of newspaper and magazine\r\narticles about Thea, and half-tone cuts, snap-shots of her on land and\r\nsea, and photographs of her in all her parts. There, in her parlor, was\r\nthe phonograph that had come from Mr. Ottenburg last June, on Thea's\r\nbirthday; she had only to go in there and turn it on, and let Thea speak\r\nfor herself. Tillie finished brushing her white hair and laughed as she\r\ngave it a smart turn and brought it into her usual French twist. If\r\nMoonstone doubted, she had evidence enough: in black and white, in\r\nfigures and photographs, evidence in hair lines on metal disks. For one\r\nwho had so often seen two and two as making six, who had so often\r\nstretched a point, added a touch, in the good game of trying to make the\r\nworld brighter than it is, there was positive bliss in having such deep\r\nfoundations of support. She need never tremble in secret lest she might\r\nsometime stretch a point in Thea's favor.--Oh, the comfort, to a soul\r\ntoo zealous, of having at last a rose so red it could not be further\r\npainted, a lily so truly auriferous that no amount of gilding could\r\nexceed the fact!\r\n\r\nTillie hurried from her bedroom, threw open the doors and windows, and\r\nlet the morning breeze blow through her little house.\r\n\r\nIn two minutes a cob fire was roaring in her kitchen stove, in five she\r\nhad set the table. At her household work Tillie was always bursting out\r\nwith shrill snatches of song, and as suddenly stopping, right in the\r\nmiddle of a phrase, as if she had been struck dumb. She emerged upon the\r\nback porch with one of these bursts, and bent down to get her butter and\r\ncream out of the ice-box. The cat was purring on the bench and the\r\nmorning-glories were thrusting their purple trumpets in through the\r\nlattice-work in a friendly way. They reminded Tillie that while she was\r\nwaiting for the coffee to boil she could get some flowers for her\r\nbreakfast table. She looked out uncertainly at a bush of sweet-briar\r\nthat grew at the edge of her yard, off across the long grass and the\r\ntomato vines. The front porch, to be sure, was dripping with crimson\r\nramblers that ought to be cut for the good of the vines; but never the\r\nrose in the hand for Tillie! She caught up the kitchen shears and off\r\nshe dashed through grass and drenching dew. Snip, snip; the\r\nshort-stemmed sweet-briars, salmon-pink and golden-hearted, with their\r\nunique and inimitable woody perfume, fell into her apron.\r\n\r\nAfter she put the eggs and toast on the table, Tillie took last Sunday's\r\nNew York paper from the rack beside the cupboard and sat down, with it\r\nfor company. In the Sunday paper there was always a page about singers,\r\neven in summer, and that week the musical page began with a sympathetic\r\naccount of Madame Kronborg's first performance of ISOLDE in London. At\r\nthe end of the notice, there was a short paragraph about her having sung\r\nfor the King at Buckingham Palace and having been presented with a jewel\r\nby His Majesty.\r\n\r\nSinging for the King; but Goodness! she was always doing things like\r\nthat! Tillie tossed her head. All through breakfast she kept sticking\r\nher sharp nose down into the glass of sweet-briar, with the old\r\nincredible lightness of heart, like a child's balloon tugging at its\r\nstring. She had always insisted, against all evidence, that life was\r\nfull of fairy tales, and it was! She had been feeling a little down,\r\nperhaps, and Thea had answered her, from so far. From a common person,\r\nnow, if you were troubled, you might get a letter. But Thea almost never\r\nwrote letters. She answered every one, friends and foes alike, in one\r\nway, her own way, her only way. Once more Tillie has to remind herself\r\nthat it is all true, and is not something she has \"made up.\" Like all\r\nromancers, she is a little terrified at seeing one of her wildest\r\nconceits admitted by the hardheaded world. If our dream comes true, we\r\nare almost afraid to believe it; for that is the best of all good\r\nfortune, and nothing better can happen to any of us.\r\n\r\nWhen the people on Sylvester Street tire of Tillie's stories, she goes\r\nover to the east part of town, where her legends are always welcome. The\r\nhumbler people of Moonstone still live there. The same little houses sit\r\nunder the cottonwoods; the men smoke their pipes in the front doorways,\r\nand the women do their washing in the back yard. The older women\r\nremember Thea, and how she used to come kicking her express wagon along\r\nthe sidewalk, steering by the tongue and holding Thor in her lap. Not\r\nmuch happens in that part of town, and the people have long memories. A\r\nboy grew up on one of those streets who went to Omaha and built up a\r\ngreat business, and is now very rich. Moonstone people always speak of\r\nhim and Thea together, as examples of Moonstone enterprise. They do,\r\nhowever, talk oftener of Thea. A voice has even a wider appeal than a\r\nfortune. It is the one gift that all creatures would possess if they\r\ncould. Dreary Maggie Evans, dead nearly twenty years, is still\r\nremembered because Thea sang at her funeral \"after she had studied in\r\nChicago.\"\r\n\r\nHowever much they may smile at her, the old inhabitants would miss\r\nTillie. Her stories give them something to talk about and to conjecture\r\nabout, cut off as they are from the restless currents of the world. The\r\nmany naked little sandbars which lie between Venice and the mainland, in\r\nthe seemingly stagnant water of the lagoons, are made habitable and\r\nwholesome only because, every night, a foot and a half of tide creeps in\r\nfrom the sea and winds its fresh brine up through all that network of\r\nshining waterways. So, into all the little settlements of quiet people,\r\ntidings of what their boys and girls are doing in the world bring real\r\nrefreshment; bring to the old, memories, and to the young, dreams.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
