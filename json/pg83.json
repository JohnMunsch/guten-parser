Simple tradesmen jumped their counters to become\r\nextemporized captains, colonels, and generals, without having\r\never passed the School of Instruction at West Point;\r\nnevertheless; they quickly rivaled their compeers of the old\r\ncontinent, and, like them, carried off victories by dint of\r\nlavish expenditure in ammunition, money, and men.\r\n\r\nBut the point in which the Americans singularly distanced the\r\nEuropeans was in the science of gunnery.  Not, indeed, that\r\ntheir weapons retained a higher degree of perfection than\r\ntheirs, but that they exhibited unheard-of dimensions, and\r\nconsequently attained hitherto unheard-of ranges.  In point of\r\ngrazing, plunging, oblique, or enfilading, or point-blank\r\nfiring, the English, French, and Prussians have nothing to\r\nlearn; but their cannon, howitzers, and mortars are mere\r\npocket-pistols compared with the formidable engines of the\r\nAmerican artillery.\r\n\r\nThis fact need surprise no one.  The Yankees, the first\r\nmechanicians in the world, are engineers-- just as the Italians\r\nare musicians and the Germans metaphysicians-- by right of birth.\r\nNothing is more natural, therefore, than to perceive them\r\napplying their audacious ingenuity to the science of gunnery.\r\nWitness the marvels of Parrott, Dahlgren, and Rodman.\r\nThe Armstrong, Palliser, and Beaulieu guns were compelled to bow\r\nbefore their transatlantic rivals.\r\n\r\nNow when an American has an idea, he directly seeks a second\r\nAmerican to share it.  If there be three, they elect a president\r\nand two secretaries.  Given four, they name a keeper of records,\r\nand the office is ready for work; five, they convene a general\r\nmeeting, and the club is fully constituted.  So things were\r\nmanaged in Baltimore.  The inventor of a new cannon associated\r\nhimself with the caster and the borer.  Thus was formed the\r\nnucleus of the \"Gun Club.\"  In a single month after its formation\r\nit numbered 1,833 effective members and 30,565 corresponding members.\r\n\r\nOne condition was imposed as a _sine qua non_ upon every\r\ncandidate for admission into the association, and that was the\r\ncondition of having designed, or (more or less) perfected a\r\ncannon; or, in default of a cannon, at least a firearm of\r\nsome description.  It may, however, be mentioned that mere\r\ninventors of revolvers, fire-shooting carbines, and similar\r\nsmall arms, met with little consideration.  Artillerists always\r\ncommanded the chief place of favor.\r\n\r\nThe estimation in which these gentlemen were held, according to\r\none of the most scientific exponents of the Gun Club, was\r\n\"proportional to the masses of their guns, and in the direct\r\nratio of the square of the distances attained by their projectiles.\"\r\n\r\nThe Gun Club once founded, it is easy to conceive the result of\r\nthe inventive genius of the Americans.  Their military weapons\r\nattained colossal proportions, and their projectiles, exceeding\r\nthe prescribed limits, unfortunately occasionally cut in two\r\nsome unoffending pedestrians.  These inventions, in fact, left\r\nfar in the rear the timid instruments of European artillery.\r\n\r\nIt is but fair to add that these Yankees, brave as they have\r\never proved themselves to be, did not confine themselves to\r\ntheories and formulae, but that they paid heavily, _in propria\r\npersona_, for their inventions.  Among them were to be counted\r\nofficers of all ranks, from lieutenants to generals; military\r\nmen of every age, from those who were just making their _debut_\r\nin the profession of arms up to those who had grown old in the\r\ngun-carriage.  Many had found their rest on the field of battle\r\nwhose names figured in the \"Book of Honor\" of the Gun Club; and\r\nof those who made good their return the greater proportion bore\r\nthe marks of their indisputable valor.  Crutches, wooden legs,\r\nartificial arms, steel hooks, caoutchouc jaws, silver craniums,\r\nplatinum noses, were all to be found in the collection; and it\r\nwas calculated by the great statistician Pitcairn that throughout\r\nthe Gun Club there was not quite one arm between four persons\r\nand two legs between six.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, these valiant artillerists took no particular\r\naccount of these little facts, and felt justly proud when the\r\ndespatches of a battle returned the number of victims at\r\nten-fold the quantity of projectiles expended.\r\n\r\nOne day, however-- sad and melancholy day!-- peace was signed\r\nbetween the survivors of the war; the thunder of the guns\r\ngradually ceased, the mortars were silent, the howitzers were\r\nmuzzled for an indefinite period, the cannon, with muzzles\r\ndepressed, were returned into the arsenal, the shot were\r\nrepiled, all bloody reminiscences were effaced; the\r\ncotton-plants grew luxuriantly in the well-manured fields, all\r\nmourning garments were laid aside, together with grief; and the\r\nGun Club was relegated to profound inactivity.\r\n\r\nSome few of the more advanced and inveterate theorists set\r\nthemselves again to work upon calculations regarding the laws\r\nof projectiles.  They reverted invariably to gigantic shells\r\nand howitzers of unparalleled caliber.  Still in default of\r\npractical experience what was the value of mere theories?\r\nConsequently, the clubrooms became deserted, the servants dozed\r\nin the antechambers, the newspapers grew mouldy on the tables,\r\nsounds of snoring came from dark corners, and the members of the\r\nGun Club, erstwhile so noisy in their seances, were reduced to\r\nsilence by this disastrous peace and gave themselves up wholly\r\nto dreams of a Platonic kind of artillery.\r\n\r\n\"This is horrible!\" said Tom Hunter one evening, while rapidly\r\ncarbonizing his wooden legs in the fireplace of the\r\nsmoking-room; \"nothing to do! nothing to look forward to! what\r\na loathsome existence!  When again shall the guns arouse us in\r\nthe morning with their delightful reports?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those days are gone by,\" said jolly Bilsby, trying to extend\r\nhis missing arms.  \"It was delightful once upon a time!\r\nOne invented a gun, and hardly was it cast, when one hastened\r\nto try it in the face of the enemy!  Then one returned to camp\r\nwith a word of encouragement from Sherman or a friendly shake\r\nof the hand from McClellan.  But now the generals are gone\r\nback to their counters; and in place of projectiles, they\r\ndespatch bales of cotton.  By Jove, the future of gunnery in\r\nAmerica is lost!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay! and no war in prospect!\" continued the famous James T.\r\nMaston, scratching with his steel hook his gutta-percha cranium.\r\n\"Not a cloud on the horizon! and that too at such a critical\r\nperiod in the progress of the science of artillery!  Yes, gentlemen!\r\nI who address you have myself this very morning perfected a\r\nmodel (plan, section, elevation, etc.) of a mortar destined to\r\nchange all the conditions of warfare!\"\r\n\r\n\"No! is it possible?\" replied Tom Hunter, his thoughts reverting\r\ninvoluntarily to a former invention of the Hon. J. T. Maston, by\r\nwhich, at its first trial, he had succeeded in killing three\r\nhundred and thirty-seven people.\r\n\r\n\"Fact!\" replied he.  \"Still, what is the use of so many studies\r\nworked out, so many difficulties vanquished?  It's mere waste\r\nof time!  The New World seems to have made up its mind to live in\r\npeace; and our bellicose _Tribune_ predicts some approaching\r\ncatastrophes arising out of this scandalous increase of population.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" replied Colonel Blomsberry, \"they are always\r\nstruggling in Europe to maintain the principle of nationalities.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there might be some field for enterprise down there; and\r\nif they would accept our services----\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you dreaming of?\" screamed Bilsby; \"work at gunnery\r\nfor the benefit of foreigners?\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be better than doing nothing here,\" returned the colonel.\r\n\r\n\"Quite so,\" said J. T. Matson; \"but still we need not dream of\r\nthat expedient.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not?\" demanded the colonel.\r\n\r\n\"Because their ideas of progress in the Old World are contrary\r\nto our American habits of thought.  Those fellows believe that\r\none can't become a general without having served first as an\r\nensign; which is as much as to say that one can't point a gun\r\nwithout having first cast it oneself!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ridiculous!\" replied Tom Hunter, whittling with his bowie-knife\r\nthe arms of his easy chair; \"but if that be the case there, all\r\nthat is left for us is to plant tobacco and distill whale-oil.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" roared J. T. Maston, \"shall we not employ these\r\nremaining years of our life in perfecting firearms?  Shall there\r\nnever be a fresh opportunity of trying the ranges of projectiles?\r\nShall the air never again be lighted with the glare of our guns?\r\nNo international difficulty ever arise to enable us to declare\r\nwar against some transatlantic power?  Shall not the French sink\r\none of our steamers, or the English, in defiance of the rights\r\nof nations, hang a few of our countrymen?\"\r\n\r\n\"No such luck,\" replied Colonel Blomsberry; \"nothing of the kind\r\nis likely to happen; and even if it did, we should not profit by it.\r\nAmerican susceptibility is fast declining, and we are all going\r\nto the dogs.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is too true,\" replied J. T. Maston, with fresh violence;\r\n\"there are a thousand grounds for fighting, and yet we don't fight.\r\nWe save up our arms and legs for the benefit of nations who don't\r\nknow what to do with them!  But stop-- without going out of one's\r\nway to find a cause for war-- did not North America once belong\r\nto the English?\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly,\" replied Tom Hunter, stamping his crutch with fury.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" replied J. T. Maston, \"why should not England in\r\nher turn belong to the Americans?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be but just and fair,\" returned Colonel Blomsberry.\r\n\r\n\"Go and propose it to the President of the United States,\" cried\r\nJ. T. Maston, \"and see how he will receive you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" growled Bilsby between the four teeth which the war had\r\nleft him; \"that will never do!\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" cried J. T. Maston, \"he mustn't count on my vote at\r\nthe next election!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor on ours,\" replied unanimously all the bellicose invalids.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile,\" replied J. T. Maston, \"allow me to say that, if I\r\ncannot get an opportunity to try my new mortars on a real field\r\nof battle, I shall say good-by to the members of the Gun Club,\r\nand go and bury myself in the prairies of Arkansas!\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case we will accompany you,\" cried the others.\r\n\r\nMatters were in this unfortunate condition, and the club was\r\nthreatened with approaching dissolution, when an unexpected\r\ncircumstance occurred to prevent so deplorable a catastrophe.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow after this conversation every member of the\r\nassociation received a sealed circular couched in the\r\nfollowing terms:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     BALTIMORE, October 3.\r\nThe president of the Gun Club has the honor to inform his colleagues\r\nthat, at the meeting of the 5th instant, he will bring before\r\nthem a communication of an extremely interesting nature.  He requests,\r\ntherefore, that they will make it convenient to attend in\r\naccordance with the present invitation.        Very cordially,\r\n                                     IMPEY BARBICANE, P.G.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BARBICANE'S COMMUNICATION\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of October, at eight p.m., a dense crowd pressed\r\ntoward the saloons of the Gun Club at No. 21 Union Square.\r\nAll the members of the association resident in Baltimore attended\r\nthe invitation of their president.  As regards the corresponding\r\nmembers, notices were delivered by hundreds throughout the streets\r\nof the city, and, large as was the great hall, it was quite\r\ninadequate to accommodate the crowd of _savants_.  They overflowed\r\ninto the adjoining rooms, down the narrow passages, into the\r\nouter courtyards.  There they ran against the vulgar herd who\r\npressed up to the doors, each struggling to reach the front ranks,\r\nall eager to learn the nature of the important communication of\r\nPresident Barbicane; all pushing, squeezing, crushing with that\r\nperfect freedom of action which is so peculiar to the masses when\r\neducated in ideas of \"self-government.\"\r\n\r\nOn that evening a stranger who might have chanced to be in\r\nBaltimore could not have gained admission for love or money into\r\nthe great hall.  That was reserved exclusively for resident or\r\ncorresponding members; no one else could possibly have obtained\r\na place; and the city magnates, municipal councilors, and\r\n\"select men\" were compelled to mingle with the mere townspeople\r\nin order to catch stray bits of news from the interior.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the vast hall presented a curious spectacle.\r\nIts immense area was singularly adapted to the purpose.\r\nLofty pillars formed of cannon, superposed upon huge mortars as a\r\nbase, supported the fine ironwork of the arches, a perfect piece\r\nof cast-iron lacework.  Trophies of blunderbuses, matchlocks,\r\narquebuses, carbines, all kinds of firearms, ancient and modern,\r\nwere picturesquely interlaced against the walls.  The gas lit\r\nup in full glare myriads of revolvers grouped in the form of\r\nlustres, while groups of pistols, and candelabra formed of\r\nmuskets bound together, completed this magnificent display\r\nof brilliance.  Models of cannon, bronze castings, sights covered\r\nwith dents, plates battered by the shots of the Gun Club,\r\nassortments of rammers and sponges, chaplets of shells, wreaths\r\nof projectiles, garlands of howitzers-- in short, all the\r\napparatus of the artillerist, enchanted the eye by this\r\nwonderful arrangement and induced a kind of belief that their\r\nreal purpose was ornamental rather than deadly.\r\n\r\nAt the further end of the saloon the president, assisted by four\r\nsecretaries, occupied a large platform.  His chair, supported by\r\na carved gun-carriage, was modeled upon the ponderous proportions\r\nof a 32-inch mortar.  It was pointed at an angle of ninety degrees,\r\nand suspended upon truncheons, so that the president could balance\r\nhimself upon it as upon a rocking-chair, a very agreeable fact in\r\nthe very hot weather.  Upon the table (a huge iron plate supported\r\nupon six carronades) stood an inkstand of exquisite elegance, made\r\nof a beautifully chased Spanish piece, and a sonnette, which, when\r\nrequired, could give forth a report equal to that of a revolver.\r\nDuring violent debates this novel kind of bell scarcely sufficed\r\nto drown the clamor of these excitable artillerists.\r\n\r\nIn front of the table benches arranged in zigzag form, like the\r\ncircumvallations of a retrenchment, formed a succession of\r\nbastions and curtains set apart for the use of the members of\r\nthe club; and on this especial evening one might say, \"All the\r\nworld was on the ramparts.\"  The president was sufficiently well\r\nknown, however, for all to be assured that he would not put his\r\ncolleagues to discomfort without some very strong motive.\r\n\r\nImpey Barbicane was a man of forty years of age, calm, cold,\r\naustere; of a singularly serious and self-contained demeanor,\r\npunctual as a chronometer, of imperturbable temper and immovable\r\ncharacter; by no means chivalrous, yet adventurous withal, and\r\nalways bringing practical ideas to bear upon the very rashest\r\nenterprises; an essentially New Englander, a Northern colonist,\r\na descendant of the old anti-Stuart Roundheads, and the\r\nimplacable enemy of the gentlemen of the South, those ancient\r\ncavaliers of the mother country.  In a word, he was a Yankee to\r\nthe backbone.\r\n\r\nBarbicane had made a large fortune as a timber merchant.\r\nBeing nominated director of artillery during the war, he proved\r\nhimself fertile in invention.  Bold in his conceptions, he\r\ncontributed powerfully to the progress of that arm and gave an\r\nimmense impetus to experimental researches.\r\n\r\nHe was personage of the middle height, having, by a rare\r\nexception in the Gun Club, all his limbs complete.  His strongly\r\nmarked features seemed drawn by square and rule; and if it be\r\ntrue that, in order to judge a man's character one must look at\r\nhis profile, Barbicane, so examined, exhibited the most certain\r\nindications of energy, audacity, and _sang-froid_.\r\n\r\nAt this moment he was sitting in his armchair, silent, absorbed,\r\nlost in reflection, sheltered under his high-crowned hat-- a\r\nkind of black cylinder which always seems firmly screwed upon\r\nthe head of an American.\r\n\r\nJust when the deep-toned clock in the great hall struck eight,\r\nBarbicane, as if he had been set in motion by a spring, raised\r\nhimself up.  A profound silence ensued, and the speaker, in a\r\nsomewhat emphatic tone of voice, commenced as follows:\r\n\r\n\"My brave, colleagues, too long already a paralyzing peace has\r\nplunged the members of the Gun Club in deplorable inactivity.\r\nAfter a period of years full of incidents we have been compelled\r\nto abandon our labors, and to stop short on the road of progress.\r\nI do not hesitate to state, baldly, that any war which would\r\nrecall us to arms would be welcome!\"  (Tremendous applause!)\r\n\"But war, gentlemen, is impossible under existing circumstances;\r\nand, however we may desire it, many years may elapse before our\r\ncannon shall again thunder in the field of battle.  We must make\r\nup our minds, then, to seek in another train of ideas some field\r\nfor the activity which we all pine for.\"\r\n\r\nThe meeting felt that the president was now approaching the\r\ncritical point, and redoubled their attention accordingly.\r\n\r\n\"For some months past, my brave colleagues,\" continued\r\nBarbicane, \"I have been asking myself whether, while confining\r\nourselves to our own particular objects, we could not enter upon\r\nsome grand experiment worthy of the nineteenth century; and\r\nwhether the progress of artillery science would not enable us to\r\ncarry it out to a successful issue.  I have been considering,\r\nworking, calculating; and the result of my studies is the conviction\r\nthat we are safe to succeed in an enterprise which to any other\r\ncountry would appear wholly impracticable.  This project, the result\r\nof long elaboration, is the object of my present communication.\r\nIt is worthy of yourselves, worthy of the antecedents of the Gun\r\nClub; and it cannot fail to make some noise in the world.\"\r\n\r\nA thrill of excitement ran through the meeting.\r\n\r\nBarbicane, having by a rapid movement firmly fixed his hat upon\r\nhis head, calmly continued his harangue:\r\n\r\n\"There is no one among you, my brave colleagues, who has not\r\nseen the Moon, or, at least, heard speak of it.  Don't be\r\nsurprised if I am about to discourse to you regarding the Queen\r\nof the Night.  It is perhaps reserved for us to become the\r\nColumbuses of this unknown world.  Only enter into my plans, and\r\nsecond me with all your power, and I will lead you to its\r\nconquest, and its name shall be added to those of the thirty-six\r\nstates which compose this Great Union.\"\r\n\r\n\"Three cheers for the Moon!\" roared the Gun Club, with one voice.\r\n\r\n\"The moon, gentlemen, has been carefully studied,\" continued\r\nBarbicane; \"her mass, density, and weight; her constitution,\r\nmotions, distance, as well as her place in the solar system,\r\nhave all been exactly determined.  Selenographic charts have\r\nbeen constructed with a perfection which equals, if it does not\r\neven surpass, that of our terrestrial maps.  Photography has\r\ngiven us proofs of the incomparable beauty of our satellite; all\r\nis known regarding the moon which mathematical science,\r\nastronomy, geology, and optics can learn about her.  But up to\r\nthe present moment no direct communication has been established\r\nwith her.\"\r\n\r\nA violent movement of interest and surprise here greeted this\r\nremark of the speaker.\r\n\r\n\"Permit me,\" he continued, \"to recount to you briefly how\r\ncertain ardent spirits, starting on imaginary journeys, have\r\npenetrated the secrets of our satellite.  In the seventeenth\r\ncentury a certain David Fabricius boasted of having seen with\r\nhis own eyes the inhabitants of the moon.  In 1649 a Frenchman,\r\none Jean Baudoin, published a `Journey performed from the Earth\r\nto the Moon by Domingo Gonzalez,' a Spanish adventurer.  At the\r\nsame period Cyrano de Bergerac published that celebrated\r\n`Journeys in the Moon' which met with such success in France.\r\nSomewhat later another Frenchman, named Fontenelle, wrote `The\r\nPlurality of Worlds,' a _chef-d'oeuvre_ of its time.  About 1835\r\na small treatise, translated from the New York _American_, related\r\nhow Sir John Herschel, having been despatched to the Cape of\r\nGood Hope for the purpose of making there some astronomical\r\ncalculations, had, by means of a telescope brought to perfection\r\nby means of internal lighting, reduced the apparent distance of\r\nthe moon to eighty yards!  He then distinctly perceived caverns\r\nfrequented by hippopotami, green mountains bordered by golden\r\nlace-work, sheep with horns of ivory, a white species of deer\r\nand inhabitants with membranous wings, like bats.  This _brochure_,\r\nthe work of an American named Locke, had a great sale.  But, to\r\nbring this rapid sketch to a close, I will only add that a\r\ncertain Hans Pfaal, of Rotterdam, launching himself in a balloon\r\nfilled with a gas extracted from nitrogen, thirty-seven times\r\nlighter than hydrogen, reached the moon after a passage of\r\nnineteen hours.  This journey, like all previous ones, was purely\r\nimaginary; still, it was the work of a popular American author--\r\nI mean Edgar Poe!\"\r\n\r\n\"Cheers for Edgar Poe!\" roared the assemblage, electrified by\r\ntheir president's words.\r\n\r\n\"I have now enumerated,\" said Barbicane, \"the experiments which\r\nI call purely paper ones, and wholly insufficient to establish\r\nserious relations with the Queen of the Night.  Nevertheless, I\r\nam bound to add that some practical geniuses have attempted to\r\nestablish actual communication with her.  Thus, a few days ago,\r\na German geometrician proposed to send a scientific expedition\r\nto the steppes of Siberia.  There, on those vast plains, they\r\nwere to describe enormous geometric figures, drawn in characters\r\nof reflecting luminosity, among which was the proposition\r\nregarding the `square of the hypothenuse,' commonly called the\r\n`Ass's Bridge' by the French.  `Every intelligent being,' said\r\nthe geometrician, `must understand the scientific meaning of\r\nthat figure.  The Selenites, do they exist, will respond by a\r\nsimilar figure; and, a communication being thus once\r\nestablished, it will be easy to form an alphabet which shall\r\nenable us to converse with the inhabitants of the moon.'  So\r\nspoke the German geometrician; but his project was never put\r\ninto practice, and up to the present day there is no bond\r\nin existence between the Earth and her satellite.  It is\r\nreserved for the practical genius of Americans to establish a\r\ncommunication with the sidereal world.  The means of arriving\r\nthither are simple, easy, certain, infallible-- and that is the\r\npurpose of my present proposal.\"\r\n\r\nA storm of acclamations greeted these words.  There was not a\r\nsingle person in the whole audience who was not overcome,\r\ncarried away, lifted out of himself by the speaker's words!\r\n\r\nLong-continued applause resounded from all sides.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the excitement had partially subsided, Barbicane\r\nresumed his speech in a somewhat graver voice.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" said he, \"what progress artillery science has made\r\nduring the last few years, and what a degree of perfection\r\nfirearms of every kind have reached.  Moreover, you are well\r\naware that, in general terms, the resisting power of cannon and\r\nthe expansive force of gunpowder are practically unlimited.\r\nWell! starting from this principle, I ask myself whether,\r\nsupposing sufficient apparatus could be obtained constructed\r\nupon the conditions of ascertained resistance, it might not be\r\npossible to project a shot up to the moon?\"\r\n\r\nAt these words a murmur of amazement escaped from a thousand\r\npanting chests; then succeeded a moment of perfect silence,\r\nresembling that profound stillness which precedes the bursting\r\nof a thunderstorm.  In point of fact, a thunderstorm did peal\r\nforth, but it was the thunder of applause, or cries, and of\r\nuproar which made the very hall tremble.  The president\r\nattempted to speak, but could not.  It was fully ten minutes\r\nbefore he could make himself heard.\r\n\r\n\"Suffer me to finish,\" he calmly continued.  \"I have looked at\r\nthe question in all its bearings, I have resolutely attacked it,\r\nand by incontrovertible calculations I find that a projectile\r\nendowed with an initial velocity of 12,000 yards per second, and\r\naimed at the moon, must necessarily reach it.  I have the honor,\r\nmy brave colleagues, to propose a trial of this little experiment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF THE PRESIDENT'S COMMUNICATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe the effect produced by the last\r\nwords of the honorable president-- the cries, the shouts, the\r\nsuccession of roars, hurrahs, and all the varied vociferations\r\nwhich the American language is capable of supplying.  It was a\r\nscene of indescribable confusion and uproar.  They shouted, they\r\nclapped, they stamped on the floor of the hall.  All the weapons\r\nin the museum discharged at once could not have more violently set\r\nin motion the waves of sound.  One need not be surprised at this.\r\nThere are some cannoneers nearly as noisy as their own guns.\r\n\r\nBarbicane remained calm in the midst of this enthusiastic\r\nclamor; perhaps he was desirous of addressing a few more words\r\nto his colleagues, for by his gestures he demanded silence,\r\nand his powerful alarum was worn out by its violent reports.\r\nNo attention, however, was paid to his request.  He was presently\r\ntorn from his seat and passed from the hands of his faithful\r\ncolleagues into the arms of a no less excited crowd.\r\n\r\nNothing can astound an American.  It has often been asserted\r\nthat the word \"impossible\" in not a French one.  People have\r\nevidently been deceived by the dictionary.  In America, all is\r\neasy, all is simple; and as for mechanical difficulties, they\r\nare overcome before they arise.  Between Barbicane's proposition\r\nand its realization no true Yankee would have allowed even the\r\nsemblance of a difficulty to be possible.  A thing with them is\r\nno sooner said than done.\r\n\r\nThe triumphal progress of the president continued throughout\r\nthe evening.  It was a regular torchlight procession.  Irish, Germans,\r\nFrench, Scotch, all the heterogeneous units which make up the\r\npopulation of Maryland shouted in their respective vernaculars;\r\nand the \"vivas,\" \"hurrahs,\" and \"bravos\" were intermingled in\r\ninexpressible enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nJust at this crisis, as though she comprehended all this\r\nagitation regarding herself, the moon shone forth with\r\nserene splendor, eclipsing by her intense illumination all the\r\nsurrounding lights.  The Yankees all turned their gaze toward\r\nher resplendent orb, kissed their hands, called her by all kinds\r\nof endearing names.  Between eight o'clock and midnight one\r\noptician in Jones'-Fall Street made his fortune by the sale of\r\nopera-glasses.\r\n\r\nMidnight arrived, and the enthusiasm showed no signs of diminution.\r\nIt spread equally among all classes of citizens-- men of science,\r\nshopkeepers, merchants, porters, chair-men, as well as \"greenhorns,\"\r\nwere stirred in their innermost fibres.  A national enterprise was\r\nat stake.  The whole city, high and low, the quays bordering the\r\nPatapsco, the ships lying in the basins, disgorged a crowd drunk\r\nwith joy, gin, and whisky.  Every one chattered, argued, discussed,\r\ndisputed, applauded, from the gentleman lounging upon the barroom\r\nsettee with his tumbler of sherry-cobbler before him down to the\r\nwaterman who got drunk upon his \"knock-me-down\" in the dingy taverns\r\nof Fell Point.\r\n\r\nAbout two A.M., however, the excitement began to subside.\r\nPresident Barbicane reached his house, bruised, crushed, and\r\nsqueezed almost to a mummy.  Hercules could not have resisted a\r\nsimilar outbreak of enthusiasm.  The crowd gradually deserted\r\nthe squares and streets.  The four railways from Philadelphia\r\nand Washington, Harrisburg and Wheeling, which converge at\r\nBaltimore, whirled away the heterogeneous population to the four\r\ncorners of the United States, and the city subsided into\r\ncomparative tranquility.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, thanks to the telegraphic wires, five\r\nhundred newspapers and journals, daily, weekly, monthly, or\r\nbi-monthly, all took up the question.  They examined it under\r\nall its different aspects, physical, meteorological, economical,\r\nor moral, up to its bearings on politics or civilization.\r\nThey debated whether the moon was a finished world, or whether\r\nit was destined to undergo any further transformation.  Did it\r\nresemble the earth at the period when the latter was destitute\r\nas yet of an atmosphere?  What kind of spectacle would its hidden\r\nhemisphere present to our terrestrial spheroid?  Granting that\r\nthe question at present was simply that of sending a projectile\r\nup to the moon, every one must see that that involved the\r\ncommencement of a series of experiments.  All must hope that\r\nsome day America would penetrate the deepest secrets of that\r\nmysterious orb; and some even seemed to fear lest its conquest\r\nshould not sensibly derange the equilibrium of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe project once under discussion, not a single paragraph\r\nsuggested a doubt of its realization.  All the papers,\r\npamphlets, reports-- all the journals published by the\r\nscientific, literary, and religious societies enlarged upon its\r\nadvantages; and the Society of Natural History of Boston, the\r\nSociety of Science and Art of Albany, the Geographical and\r\nStatistical Society of New York, the Philosophical Society of\r\nPhiladelphia, and the Smithsonian of Washington sent innumerable\r\nletters of congratulation to the Gun Club, together with offers\r\nof immediate assistance and money.\r\n\r\nFrom that day forward Impey Barbicane became one of the greatest\r\ncitizens of the United States, a kind of Washington of science.\r\nA single trait of feeling, taken from many others, will serve to\r\nshow the point which this homage of a whole people to a single\r\nindividual attained.\r\n\r\nSome few days after this memorable meeting of the Gun Club, the\r\nmanager of an English company announced, at the Baltimore\r\ntheatre, the production of \"Much ado about Nothing.\"  But the\r\npopulace, seeing in that title an allusion damaging to\r\nBarbicane's project, broke into the auditorium, smashed the\r\nbenches, and compelled the unlucky director to alter his playbill.\r\nBeing a sensible man, he bowed to the public will and replaced\r\nthe offending comedy by \"As you like it\"; and for many weeks he\r\nrealized fabulous profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY FROM THE OBSERVATORY OF CAMBRIDGE\r\n\r\n\r\nBarbicane, however, lost not one moment amid all the enthusiasm\r\nof which he had become the object.  His first care was to\r\nreassemble his colleagues in the board-room of the Gun Club.\r\nThere, after some discussion, it was agreed to consult the\r\nastronomers regarding the astronomical part of the enterprise.\r\nTheir reply once ascertained, they could then discuss the\r\nmechanical means, and nothing should be wanting to ensure the\r\nsuccess of this great experiment.\r\n\r\nA note couched in precise terms, containing special\r\ninterrogatories, was then drawn up and addressed to the\r\nObservatory of Cambridge in Massachusetts.  This city, where the\r\nfirst university of the United States was founded, is justly\r\ncelebrated for its astronomical staff.  There are to be found\r\nassembled all the most eminent men of science.  Here is to be\r\nseen at work that powerful telescope which enabled Bond to\r\nresolve the nebula of Andromeda, and Clarke to discover the\r\nsatellite of Sirius.  This celebrated institution fully justified\r\non all points the confidence reposed in it by the Gun Club.\r\nSo, after two days, the reply so impatiently awaited was placed\r\nin the hands of President Barbicane.\r\n\r\nIt was couched in the following terms:\r\n\r\n_The Director of the Cambridge Observatory to the President\r\n           of the Gun Club at Baltimore._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    CAMBRIDGE, October 7.\r\nOn the receipt of your favor of the 6th instant, addressed to\r\nthe Observatory of Cambridge in the name of the members of the\r\nBaltimore Gun Club, our staff was immediately called together,\r\nand it was judged expedient to reply as follows:\r\n\r\nThe questions which have been proposed to it are these--\r\n\r\n\"1. Is it possible to transmit a projectile up to the moon?\r\n\r\n\"2. What is the exact distance which separates the earth from\r\nits satellite?\r\n\r\n\"3. What will be the period of transit of the projectile when\r\nendowed with sufficient initial velocity? and, consequently, at\r\nwhat moment ought it to be discharged in order that it may touch\r\nthe moon at a particular point?\r\n\r\n\"4. At what precise moment will the moon present herself in the\r\nmost favorable position to be reached by the projectile?\r\n\r\n\"5. What point in the heavens ought the cannon to be aimed at\r\nwhich is intended to discharge the projectile?\r\n\r\n\"6. What place will the moon occupy in the heavens at the moment\r\nof the projectile's departure?\"\r\n\r\nRegarding the _first_ question, \"Is it possible to transmit a\r\nprojectile up to the moon?\"\r\n\r\n_Answer._-- Yes; provided it possess an initial velocity of\r\n1,200 yards per second; calculations prove that to be sufficient.\r\nIn proportion as we recede from the earth the action of gravitation\r\ndiminishes in the inverse ratio of the square of the distance;\r\nthat is to say, _at three times a given distance the action is\r\nnine times less._  Consequently, the weight of a shot will decrease,\r\nand will become reduced to _zero_ at the instant that the attraction\r\nof the moon exactly counterpoises that of the earth; that is to say\r\nat 47/52 of its passage.  At that instant the projectile will\r\nhave no weight whatever; and, if it passes that point, it will\r\nfall into the moon by the sole effect of the lunar attraction.\r\nThe _theoretical possibility_ of the experiment is therefore\r\nabsolutely demonstrated; its _success_ must depend upon the power\r\nof the engine employed.\r\n\r\nAs to the _second_ question, \"What is the exact distance which\r\nseparates the earth from its satellite?\"\r\n\r\n_Answer._-- The moon does not describe a _circle_ round the\r\nearth, but rather an _ellipse_, of which our earth occupies one\r\nof the _foci_; the consequence, therefore, is, that at certain\r\ntimes it approaches nearer to, and at others it recedes farther\r\nfrom, the earth; in astronomical language, it is at one time in\r\n_apogee_, at another in _perigee_.  Now the difference between\r\nits greatest and its least distance is too considerable to be\r\nleft out of consideration.  In point of fact, in its apogee the\r\nmoon is 247,552 miles, and in its perigee, 218,657 miles only\r\ndistant; a fact which makes a difference of 28,895 miles, or\r\nmore than one-ninth of the entire distance.  The perigee\r\ndistance, therefore, is that which ought to serve as the basis\r\nof all calculations.\r\n\r\nTo the _third_ question.\r\n\r\n_Answer._-- If the shot should preserve continuously its initial\r\nvelocity of 12,000 yards per second, it would require little\r\nmore than nine hours to reach its destination; but, inasmuch as\r\nthat initial velocity will be continually decreasing, it will\r\noccupy 300,000 seconds, that is 83hrs. 20m. in reaching the\r\npoint where the attraction of the earth and moon will be _in\r\nequilibrio_.  From this point it will fall into the moon in\r\n50,000 seconds, or 13hrs. 53m. 20sec.  It will be desirable,\r\ntherefore, to discharge it 97hrs. 13m. 20sec. before the arrival\r\nof the moon at the point aimed at.\r\n\r\nRegarding question _four_, \"At what precise moment will the moon\r\npresent herself in the most favorable position, etc.?\"\r\n\r\n_Answer._-- After what has been said above, it will be\r\nnecessary, first of all, to choose the period when the moon will\r\nbe in perigee, and _also_ the moment when she will be crossing\r\nthe zenith, which latter event will further diminish the entire\r\ndistance by a length equal to the radius of the earth, _i. e._\r\n3,919 miles; the result of which will be that the final passage\r\nremaining to be accomplished will be 214,976 miles.  But although\r\nthe moon passes her perigee every month, she does not reach the\r\nzenith always _at exactly the same moment_.  She does not appear\r\nunder these two conditions simultaneously, except at long\r\nintervals of time.  It will be necessary, therefore, to wait for\r\nthe moment when her passage in perigee shall coincide with that\r\nin the zenith.  Now, by a fortunate circumstance, on the 4th of\r\nDecember in the ensuing year the moon _will_ present these\r\ntwo conditions.  At midnight she will be in perigee, that is,\r\nat her shortest distance from the earth, and at the same moment\r\nshe will be crossing the zenith.\r\n\r\nOn the _fifth_ question, \"At what point in the heavens ought the\r\ncannon to be aimed?\"\r\n\r\n_Answer._-- The preceding remarks being admitted, the cannon\r\nought to be pointed to the zenith of the place.  Its fire,\r\ntherefore, will be perpendicular to the plane of the horizon;\r\nand the projectile will soonest pass beyond the range of the\r\nterrestrial attraction.  But, in order that the moon should\r\nreach the zenith of a given place, it is necessary that the\r\nplace should not exceed in latitude the declination of the\r\nluminary; in other words, it must be comprised within the\r\ndegrees 0@ and 28@ of lat. N. or S. In every other spot the fire\r\nmust necessarily be oblique, which would seriously militate\r\nagainst the success of the experiment.\r\n\r\nAs to the _sixth_ question, \"What place will the moon occupy in\r\nthe heavens at the moment of the projectile's departure?\"\r\n\r\n_Answer._-- At the moment when the projectile shall be discharged\r\ninto space, the moon, which travels daily forward 13@ 10' 35'',\r\nwill be distant from the zenith point by four times that quantity,\r\n_i. e._ by 52@ 41' 20'', a space which corresponds to the path\r\nwhich she will describe during the entire journey of the projectile.\r\nBut, inasmuch as it is equally necessary to take into account the\r\ndeviation which the rotary motion of the earth will impart to the\r\nshot, and as the shot cannot reach the moon until after a deviation\r\nequal to 16 radii of the earth, which, calculated upon the moon's\r\norbit, are equal to about eleven degrees, it becomes necessary to\r\nadd these eleven degrees to those which express the retardation of\r\nthe moon just mentioned:  that is to say, in round numbers, about\r\nsixty-four degrees.  Consequently, at the moment of firing the\r\nvisual radius applied to the moon will describe, with the vertical\r\nline of the place, an angle of sixty-four degrees.\r\n\r\nThese are our answers to the questions proposed to the\r\nObservatory of Cambridge by the members of the Gun Club:\r\n\r\nTo sum up--\r\n\r\n1st. The cannon ought to be planted in a country situated\r\nbetween 0@ and 28@ of N. or S. lat.\r\n\r\n2nd. It ought to be pointed directly toward the zenith of the place.\r\n\r\n3rd. The projectile ought to be propelled with an initial\r\nvelocity of 12,000 yards per second.\r\n\r\n4th. It ought to be discharged at 10hrs. 46m. 40sec. of the 1st\r\nof December of the ensuing year.\r\n\r\n5th. It will meet the moon four days after its discharge,\r\nprecisely at midnight on the 4th of December, at the moment of\r\nits transit across the zenith.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Gun Club ought, therefore, without delay, to\r\ncommence the works necessary for such an experiment, and to be\r\nprepared to set to work at the moment determined upon; for, if\r\nthey should suffer this 4th of December to go by, they will not\r\nfind the moon again under the same conditions of perigee and of\r\nzenith until eighteen years and eleven days afterward.\r\n\r\nThe staff of the Cambridge Observatory place themselves entirely\r\nat their disposal in respect of all questions of theoretical\r\nastronomy; and herewith add their congratulations to those of\r\nall the rest of America.\r\n               For the Astronomical Staff,\r\n                               J. M. BELFAST,\r\n_Director of the Observatory of Cambridge._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANCE OF THE MOON\r\n\r\n\r\nAn observer endued with an infinite range of vision, and placed\r\nin that unknown center around which the entire world revolves,\r\nmight have beheld myriads of atoms filling all space during the\r\nchaotic epoch of the universe.  Little by little, as ages went\r\non, a change took place; a general law of attraction manifested\r\nitself, to which the hitherto errant atoms became obedient:\r\nthese atoms combined together chemically according to their\r\naffinities, formed themselves into molecules, and composed those\r\nnebulous masses with which the depths of the heavens are strewed.\r\nThese masses became immediately endued with a rotary motion\r\naround their own central point.  This center, formed of\r\nindefinite molecules, began to revolve around its own axis\r\nduring its gradual condensation; then, following the immutable\r\nlaws of mechanics, in proportion as its bulk diminished by\r\ncondensation, its rotary motion became accelerated, and these\r\ntwo effects continuing, the result was the formation of one\r\nprincipal star, the center of the nebulous mass.\r\n\r\nBy attentively watching, the observer would then have perceived\r\nthe other molecules of the mass, following the example of this\r\ncentral star, become likewise condensed by gradually accelerated\r\nrotation, and gravitating round it in the shape of innumerable stars.\r\nThus was formed the _Nebulae_, of which astronomers have reckoned\r\nup nearly 5,000.\r\n\r\nAmong these 5,000 nebulae there is one which has received the\r\nname of the Milky Way, and which contains eighteen millions of\r\nstars, each of which has become the center of a solar world.\r\n\r\nIf the observer had then specially directed his attention to one\r\nof the more humble and less brilliant of these stellar bodies,\r\na star of the fourth class, that which is arrogantly called the\r\nSun, all the phenomena to which the formation of the Universe is to\r\nbe ascribed would have been successively fulfilled before his eyes.\r\nIn fact, he would have perceived this sun, as yet in the gaseous\r\nstate, and composed of moving molecules, revolving round its axis\r\nin order to accomplish its work of concentration.  This motion,\r\nfaithful to the laws of mechanics, would have been accelerated\r\nwith the diminution of its volume; and a moment would have arrived\r\nwhen the centrifugal force would have overpowered the centripetal,\r\nwhich causes the molecules all to tend toward the center.\r\n\r\nAnother phenomenon would now have passed before the observer's\r\neye, and the molecules situated on the plane of the equator,\r\nescaping like a stone from a sling of which the cord had\r\nsuddenly snapped, would have formed around the sun sundry\r\nconcentric rings resembling that of Saturn.  In their turn,\r\nagain, these rings of cosmical matter, excited by a rotary\r\nmotion about the central mass, would have been broken up and\r\ndecomposed into secondary nebulosities, that is to say,\r\ninto planets.  Similarly he would have observed these planets\r\nthrow off one or more rings each, which became the origin of the\r\nsecondary bodies which we call satellites.\r\n\r\nThus, then, advancing from atom to molecule, from molecule to\r\nnebulous mass, from that to principal star, from star to sun,\r\nfrom sun to planet, and hence to satellite, we have the whole\r\nseries of transformations undergone by the heavenly bodies\r\nduring the first days of the world.\r\n\r\nNow, of those attendant bodies which the sun maintains in their\r\nelliptical orbits by the great law of gravitation, some few in\r\nturn possess satellites.  Uranus has eight, Saturn eight, Jupiter\r\nfour, Neptune possibly three, and the Earth one.  This last, one\r\nof the least important of the entire solar system, we call the\r\nMoon; and it is she whom the daring genius of the Americans\r\nprofessed their intention of conquering.\r\n\r\nThe moon, by her comparative proximity, and the constantly\r\nvarying appearances produced by her several phases, has always\r\noccupied a considerable share of the attention of the\r\ninhabitants of the earth.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Thales of Miletus, in the fifth century B.C.,\r\ndown to that of Copernicus in the fifteenth and Tycho Brahe in\r\nthe sixteenth century A.D., observations have been from time to\r\ntime carried on with more or less correctness, until in the\r\npresent day the altitudes of the lunar mountains have been\r\ndetermined with exactitude.  Galileo explained the phenomena of\r\nthe lunar light produced during certain of her phases by the\r\nexistence of mountains, to which he assigned a mean altitude of\r\n27,000 feet.  After him Hevelius, an astronomer of Dantzic,\r\nreduced the highest elevations to 15,000 feet; but the\r\ncalculations of Riccioli brought them up again to 21,000 feet.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the eighteenth century Herschel, armed with a powerful\r\ntelescope, considerably reduced the preceding measurements.\r\nHe assigned a height of 11,400 feet to the maximum elevations,\r\nand reduced the mean of the different altitudes to little more\r\nthan 2,400 feet.  But Herschel's calculations were in their turn\r\ncorrected by the observations of Halley, Nasmyth, Bianchini,\r\nGruithuysen, and others; but it was reserved for the labors of\r\nBoeer and Maedler finally to solve the question.  They succeeded\r\nin measuring 1,905 different elevations, of which six exceed\r\n15,000 feet, and twenty-two exceed 14,400 feet.  The highest\r\nsummit of all towers to a height of 22,606 feet above the surface\r\nof the lunar disc.  At the same period the examination of the moon\r\nwas completed.  She appeared completely riddled with craters, and\r\nher essentially volcanic character was apparent at each observation.\r\nBy the absence of refraction in the rays of the planets occulted\r\nby her we conclude that she is absolutely devoid of an atmosphere.\r\nThe absence of air entails the absence of water.  It became,\r\ntherefore, manifest that the Selenites, to support life under\r\nsuch conditions, must possess a special organization of their\r\nown, must differ remarkably from the inhabitants of the earth.\r\n\r\nAt length, thanks to modern art, instruments of still higher\r\nperfection searched the moon without intermission, not leaving\r\na single point of her surface unexplored; and notwithstanding\r\nthat her diameter measures 2,150 miles, her surface equals the\r\none-fifteenth part of that of our globe, and her bulk the\r\none-forty-ninth part of that of the terrestrial spheroid-- not\r\none of her secrets was able to escape the eyes of the\r\nastronomers; and these skillful men of science carried to an\r\neven greater degree their prodigious observations.\r\n\r\nThus they remarked that, during full moon, the disc appeared\r\nscored in certain parts with white lines; and, during the\r\nphases, with black.  On prosecuting the study of these with\r\nstill greater precision, they succeeded in obtaining an exact\r\naccount of the nature of these lines.  They were long and narrow\r\nfurrows sunk between parallel ridges, bordering generally upon\r\nthe edges of the craters.  Their length varied between ten and 100\r\nmiles, and their width was about 1,600 yards.  Astronomers called\r\nthem chasms, but they could not get any further.  Whether these\r\nchasms were the dried-up beds of ancient rivers or not they were\r\nunable thoroughly to ascertain.\r\n\r\nThe Americans, among others, hoped one day or other to\r\ndetermine this geological question.  They also undertook to\r\nexamine the true nature of that system of parallel ramparts\r\ndiscovered on the moon's surface by Gruithuysen, a learned\r\nprofessor of Munich, who considered them to be \"a system of\r\nfortifications thrown up by the Selenitic engineers.\"  These two\r\npoints, yet obscure, as well as others, no doubt, could not be\r\ndefinitely settled except by direct communication with the moon.\r\n\r\nRegarding the degree of intensity of its light, there was\r\nnothing more to learn on this point.  It was known that it is\r\n300,000 times weaker than that of the sun, and that its heat has\r\nno appreciable effect upon the thermometer.  As to the\r\nphenomenon known as the \"ashy light,\" it is explained naturally\r\nby the effect of the transmission of the solar rays from the\r\nearth to the moon, which give the appearance of completeness to\r\nthe lunar disc, while it presents itself under the crescent form\r\nduring its first and last phases.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of knowledge acquired regarding the earth's\r\nsatellite, which the Gun Club undertook to perfect in all its\r\naspects, cosmographic, geological, political, and moral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nPERMISSIVE LIMITS OF IGNORANCE AND BELIEF IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe immediate result of Barbicane's proposition was to place upon\r\nthe orders of the day all the astronomical facts relative to the\r\nQueen of the Night.  Everybody set to work to study assiduously.\r\nOne would have thought that the moon had just appeared for the\r\nfirst time, and that no one had ever before caught a glimpse of\r\nher in the heavens.  The papers revived all the old anecdotes in\r\nwhich the \"sun of the wolves\" played a part; they recalled the\r\ninfluences which the ignorance of past ages ascribed to her; in\r\nshort, all America was seized with selenomania, or had become moon-mad.\r\n\r\nThe scientific journals, for their part, dealt more especially with\r\nthe questions which touched upon the enterprise of the Gun Club.\r\nThe letter of the Observatory of Cambridge was published by them,\r\nand commented upon with unreserved approval.\r\n\r\nUntil that time most people had been ignorant of the mode in which\r\nthe distance which separates the moon from the earth is calculated.\r\nThey took advantage of this fact to explain to them that this\r\ndistance was obtained by measuring the parallax of the moon.\r\nThe term parallax proving \"caviare to the general,\" they further\r\nexplained that it meant the angle formed by the inclination of two\r\nstraight lines drawn from either extremity of the earth's radius\r\nto the moon.  On doubts being expressed as to the correctness of\r\nthis method, they immediately proved that not only was the mean\r\ndistance 234,347 miles, but that astronomers could not possibly\r\nbe in error in their estimate by more than seventy miles either way.\r\n\r\nTo those who were not familiar with the motions of the moon,\r\nthey demonstrated that she possesses two distinct motions, the\r\nfirst being that of rotation upon her axis, the second being\r\nthat of revolution round the earth, accomplishing both together\r\nin an equal period of time, that is to say, in twenty-seven and\r\none-third days.\r\n\r\nThe motion of rotation is that which produces day and night on\r\nthe surface of the moon; save that there is only one day and one\r\nnight in the lunar month, each lasting three hundred and\r\nfifty-four and one-third hours.  But, happily for her, the face\r\nturned toward the terrestrial globe is illuminated by it with an\r\nintensity equal to that of fourteen moons.  As to the other\r\nface, always invisible to us, it has of necessity three hundred\r\nand fifty-four hours of absolute night, tempered only by that\r\n\"pale glimmer which falls upon it from the stars.\"\r\n\r\nSome well-intentioned, but rather obstinate persons, could not\r\nat first comprehend how, if the moon displays invariably the\r\nsame face to the earth during her revolution, she can describe\r\none turn round herself.  To such they answered, \"Go into your\r\ndining-room, and walk round the table in such a way as to always\r\nkeep your face turned toward the center; by the time you will\r\nhave achieved one complete round you will have completed one\r\nturn around yourself, since your eye will have traversed\r\nsuccessively every point of the room.  Well, then, the room is\r\nthe heavens, the table is the earth, and the moon is yourself.\"\r\nAnd they would go away delighted.\r\n\r\nSo, then the moon displays invariably the same face to the\r\nearth; nevertheless, to be quite exact, it is necessary to add\r\nthat, in consequence of certain fluctuations of north and south,\r\nand of west and east, termed her libration, she permits rather\r\nmore than half, that is to say, five-sevenths, to be seen.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ignoramuses came to understand as much as the\r\ndirector of the observatory himself knew, they began to worry\r\nthemselves regarding her revolution round the earth, whereupon\r\ntwenty scientific reviews immediately came to the rescue.\r\nThey pointed out to them that the firmament, with its infinitude\r\nof stars, may be considered as one vast dial-plate, upon which the\r\nmoon travels, indicating the true time to all the inhabitants of\r\nthe earth; that it is during this movement that the Queen of\r\nNight exhibits her different phases; that the moon is _full_\r\nwhen she is in _opposition_ with the sun, that is when the three\r\nbodies are on the same straight line, the earth occupying the\r\ncenter; that she is _new_ when she is in _conjunction_ with the\r\nsun, that is, when she is between it and the earth; and, lastly\r\nthat she is in her _first_ or _last_ quarter, when she makes\r\nwith the sun and the earth an angle of which she herself occupies\r\nthe apex.\r\n\r\nRegarding the altitude which the moon attains above the horizon,\r\nthe letter of the Cambridge Observatory had said all that was to\r\nbe said in this respect.  Every one knew that this altitude\r\nvaries according to the latitude of the observer.  But the only\r\nzones of the globe in which the moon passes the zenith, that is,\r\nthe point directly over the head of the spectator, are of\r\nnecessity comprised between the twenty-eighth parallels and\r\nthe equator.  Hence the importance of the advice to try the\r\nexperiment upon some point of that part of the globe, in order\r\nthat the projectile might be discharged perpendicularly, and so\r\nthe soonest escape the action of gravitation.  This was an\r\nessential condition to the success of the enterprise, and\r\ncontinued actively to engage the public attention.\r\n\r\nRegarding the path described by the moon in her revolution round\r\nthe earth, the Cambridge Observatory had demonstrated that this\r\npath is a re-entering curve, not a perfect circle, but an\r\nellipse, of which the earth occupies one of the _foci_.  It was\r\nalso well understood that it is farthest removed from the earth\r\nduring its _apogee_, and approaches most nearly to it at its _perigee_.\r\n\r\nSuch was then the extent of knowledge possessed by every\r\nAmerican on the subject, and of which no one could decently\r\nprofess ignorance.  Still, while these principles were being\r\nrapidly disseminated many errors and illusory fears proved less\r\neasy to eradicate.\r\n\r\nFor instance, some worthy persons maintained that the moon was\r\nan ancient comet which, in describing its elongated orbit round\r\nthe sun, happened to pass near the earth, and became confined\r\nwithin her circle of attraction.  These drawing-room astronomers\r\nprofessed to explain the charred aspect of the moon-- a disaster\r\nwhich they attributed to the intensity of the solar heat; only,\r\non being reminded that comets have an atmosphere, and that the\r\nmoon has little or none, they were fairly at a loss for a reply.\r\n\r\nOthers again, belonging to the doubting class, expressed certain\r\nfears as to the position of the moon.  They had heard it said\r\nthat, according to observations made in the time of the Caliphs,\r\nher revolution had become accelerated in a certain degree.\r\nHence they concluded, logically enough, that an acceleration of\r\nmotion ought to be accompanied by a corresponding diminution in\r\nthe distance separating the two bodies; and that, supposing the\r\ndouble effect to be continued to infinity, the moon would end by\r\none day falling into the earth.  However, they became reassured\r\nas to the fate of future generations on being apprised that,\r\naccording to the calculations of Laplace, this acceleration of\r\nmotion is confined within very restricted limits, and that a\r\nproportional diminution of speed will be certain to succeed it.\r\nSo, then, the stability of the solar system would not be deranged\r\nin ages to come.\r\n\r\nThere remains but the third class, the superstitious.\r\nThese worthies were not content merely to rest in ignorance;\r\nthey must know all about things which had no existence whatever,\r\nand as to the moon, they had long known all about her.  One set\r\nregarded her disc as a polished mirror, by means of which people\r\ncould see each other from different points of the earth and\r\ninterchange their thoughts.  Another set pretended that out of\r\none thousand new moons that had been observed, nine hundred and\r\nfifty had been attended with remarkable disturbances, such as\r\ncataclysms, revolutions, earthquakes, the deluge, etc.  Then they\r\nbelieved in some mysterious influence exercised by her over human\r\ndestinies-- that every Selenite was attached to some inhabitant\r\nof the earth by a tie of sympathy; they maintained that the\r\nentire vital system is subject to her control, etc.  But in time\r\nthe majority renounced these vulgar errors, and espoused the true\r\nside of the question.  As for the Yankees, they had no other\r\nambition than to take possession of this new continent of the sky,\r\nand to plant upon the summit of its highest elevation the star-\r\nspangled banner of the United States of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HYMN OF THE CANNON-BALL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Observatory of Cambridge in its memorable letter had treated the\r\nquestion from a purely astronomical point of view.  The mechanical\r\npart still remained.\r\n\r\nPresident Barbicane had, without loss of time, nominated a\r\nworking committee of the Gun Club.  The duty of this committee\r\nwas to resolve the three grand questions of the cannon, the\r\nprojectile, and the powder.  It was composed of four members of\r\ngreat technical knowledge, Barbicane (with a casting vote in\r\ncase of equality), General Morgan, Major Elphinstone, and J. T.\r\nMaston, to whom were confided the functions of secretary.  On the\r\n8th of October the committee met at the house of President\r\nBarbicane, 3 Republican Street.  The meeting was opened by the\r\npresident himself.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"we have to resolve one of the most\r\nimportant problems in the whole of the noble science of gunnery.\r\nIt might appear, perhaps, the most logical course to devote our\r\nfirst meeting to the discussion of the engine to be employed.\r\nNevertheless, after mature consideration, it has appeared to me\r\nthat the question of the projectile must take precedence of that\r\nof the cannon, and that the dimensions of the latter must\r\nnecessarily depend on those of the former.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suffer me to say a word,\" here broke in J. T. Maston.\r\nPermission having been granted, \"Gentlemen,\" said he with an\r\ninspired accent, \"our president is right in placing the question\r\nof the projectile above all others.  The ball we are about to\r\ndischarge at the moon is our ambassador to her, and I wish to\r\nconsider it from a moral point of view.  The cannon-ball,\r\ngentlemen, to my mind, is the most magnificent manifestation of\r\nhuman power.  If Providence has created the stars and the planets,\r\nman has called the cannon-ball into existence.  Let Providence\r\nclaim the swiftness of electricity and of light, of the stars,\r\nthe comets, and the planets, of wind and sound-- we claim to\r\nhave invented the swiftness of the cannon-ball, a hundred times\r\nsuperior to that of the swiftest horses or railway train.\r\nHow glorious will be the moment when, infinitely exceeding all\r\nhitherto attained velocities, we shall launch our new projectile\r\nwith the rapidity of seven miles a second!  Shall it not,\r\ngentlemen-- shall it not be received up there with the honors\r\ndue to a terrestrial ambassador?\"\r\n\r\nOvercome with emotion the orator sat down and applied himself to\r\na huge plate of sandwiches before him.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Barbicane, \"let us quit the domain of poetry and\r\ncome direct to the question.\"\r\n\r\n\"By all means,\" replied the members, each with his mouth full\r\nof sandwich.\r\n\r\n\"The problem before us,\" continued the president, \"is how to\r\ncommunicate to a projectile a velocity of 12,000 yards per second.\r\nLet us at present examine the velocities hitherto attained.\r\nGeneral Morgan will be able to enlighten us on this point.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the more easily,\" replied the general, \"that during the war\r\nI was a member of the committee of experiments.  I may say,\r\nthen, that the 100-pounder Dahlgrens, which carried a distance\r\nof 5,000 yards, impressed upon their projectile an initial\r\nvelocity of 500 yards a second.  The Rodman Columbiad threw a\r\nshot weighing half a ton a distance of six miles, with a\r\nvelocity of 800 yards per second-- a result which Armstrong and\r\nPalisser have never obtained in England.\"\r\n\r\n\"This,\" replied Barbicane, \"is, I believe, the maximum velocity\r\never attained?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is so,\" replied the general.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" groaned J. T. Maston, \"if my mortar had not burst----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" quietly replied Barbicane, \"but it did burst.  We must\r\ntake, then, for our starting point, this velocity of 800 yards.\r\nWe must increase it twenty-fold.  Now, reserving for another\r\ndiscussion the means of producing this velocity, I will call\r\nyour attention to the dimensions which it will be proper to\r\nassign to the shot.  You understand that we have nothing to do\r\nhere with projectiles weighing at most but half a ton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" demanded the major.\r\n\r\n\"Because the shot,\" quickly replied J. T. Maston, \"must be big\r\nenough to attract the attention of the inhabitants of the moon,\r\nif there are any?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Barbicane, \"and for another reason more important still.\"\r\n\r\n\"What mean you?\" asked the major.\r\n\r\n\"I mean that it is not enough to discharge a projectile, and\r\nthen take no further notice of it; we must follow it throughout\r\nits course, up to the moment when it shall reach its goal.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" shouted the general and the major in great surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly,\" replied Barbicane composedly, \"or our experiment\r\nwould produce no result.\"\r\n\r\n\"But then,\" replied the major, \"you will have to give this\r\nprojectile enormous dimensions.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!  Be so good as to listen.  You know that optical\r\ninstruments have acquired great perfection; with certain\r\ninstruments we have succeeded in obtaining enlargements of 6,000\r\ntimes and reducing the moon to within forty miles' distance.\r\nNow, at this distance, any objects sixty feet square would be\r\nperfectly visible.\r\n\r\n\"If, then, the penetrative power of telescopes has not been\r\nfurther increased, it is because that power detracts from their\r\nlight; and the moon, which is but a reflecting mirror, does not\r\ngive back sufficient light to enable us to perceive objects of\r\nlesser magnitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, what do you propose to do?\" asked the general.\r\n\"Would you give your projectile a diameter of sixty feet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you intend, then, to increase the luminous power of the moon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly so.  If I can succeed in diminishing the density of the\r\natmosphere through which the moon's light has to travel I shall\r\nhave rendered her light more intense.  To effect that object it\r\nwill be enough to establish a telescope on some elevated mountain.\r\nThat is what we will do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I give it up,\" answered the major.  \"You have such a way of\r\nsimplifying things.  And what enlargement do you expect to\r\nobtain in this way?\"\r\n\r\n\"One of 48,000 times, which should bring the moon within an\r\napparent distance of five miles; and, in order to be visible,\r\nobjects need not have a diameter of more than nine feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, then,\" cried J. T. Maston, \"our projectile need not be more\r\nthan nine feet in diameter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me observe, however,\" interrupted Major Elphinstone, \"this\r\nwill involve a weight such as----\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear major,\" replied Barbicane, \"before discussing its\r\nweight permit me to enumerate some of the marvels which our\r\nancestors have achieved in this respect.  I don't mean to\r\npretend that the science of gunnery has not advanced, but it\r\nis as well to bear in mind that during the middle ages they\r\nobtained results more surprising, I will venture to say, than ours.\r\nFor instance, during the siege of Constantinople by Mahomet II.,\r\nin 1453, stone shot of 1,900 pounds weight were employed.  At Malta,\r\nin the time of the knights, there was a gun of the fortress of St.\r\nElmo which threw a projectile weighing 2,500 pounds.  And, now,\r\nwhat is the extent of what we have seen ourselves?  Armstrong guns\r\ndischarging shot of 500 pounds, and the Rodman guns projectiles\r\nof half a ton!  It seems, then, that if projectiles have gained\r\nin range, they have lost far more in weight.  Now, if we turn our\r\nefforts in that direction, we ought to arrive, with the progress\r\non science, at ten times the weight of the shot of Mahomet II.\r\nand the Knights of Malta.\"\r\n\r\n\"Clearly,\" replied the major; \"but what metal do you calculate\r\nupon employing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Simply cast iron,\" said General Morgan.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" interrupted the major, \"since the weight of a shot is\r\nproportionate to its volume, an iron ball of nine feet in\r\ndiameter would be of tremendous weight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if it were solid, not if it were hollow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hollow? then it would be a shell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a shell,\" replied Barbicane; \"decidely it must be.  A solid\r\nshot of 108 inches would weigh more than 200,000 pounds, a weight\r\nevidently far too great.  Still, as we must reserve a certain\r\nstability for our projectile, I propose to give it a weight of\r\n20,000 pounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, then, will be the thickness of the sides?\" asked the major.\r\n\r\n\"If we follow the usual proportion,\" replied Morgan, \"a diameter\r\nof 108 inches would require sides of two feet thickness, or less.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be too much,\" replied Barbicane; \"for you will\r\nobserve that the question is not that of a shot intended to\r\npierce an iron plate; it will suffice to give it sides strong\r\nenough to resist the pressure of the gas.  The problem,\r\ntherefore, is this-- What thickness ought a cast-iron shell to\r\nhave in order not to weight more than 20,000 pounds?  Our clever\r\nsecretary will soon enlighten us upon this point.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing easier.\" replied the worthy secretary of the committee;\r\nand, rapidly tracing a few algebraical formulae upon paper,\r\namong which _n_^2 and _x_^2 frequently appeared, he presently said:\r\n\r\n\"The sides will require a thickness of less than two inches.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will that be enough?\" asked the major doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Clearly not!\" replied the president.\r\n\r\n\"What is to be done, then?\" said Elphinstone, with a puzzled air.\r\n\r\n\"Employ another metal instead of iron.\"\r\n\r\n\"Copper?\" said Morgan.\r\n\r\n\"No! that would be too heavy.  I have better than that to offer.\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\" asked the major.\r\n\r\n\"Aluminum!\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Aluminum?\" cried his three colleagues in chorus.\r\n\r\n\"Unquestionably, my friends.  This valuable metal possesses the\r\nwhiteness of silver, the indestructibility of gold, the tenacity\r\nof iron, the fusibility of copper, the lightness of glass.  It is\r\neasily wrought, is very widely distributed, forming the base of\r\nmost of the rocks, is three times lighter than iron, and seems to\r\nhave been created for the express purpose of furnishing us with\r\nthe material for our projectile.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my dear president,\" said the major, \"is not the cost price\r\nof aluminum extremely high?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was so at its first discovery, but it has fallen now to nine\r\ndollars a pound.\"\r\n\r\n\"But still, nine dollars a pound!\" replied the major, who was\r\nnot willing readily to give in; \"even that is an enormous price.\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly, my dear major; but not beyond our reach.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will the projectile weigh then?\" asked Morgan.\r\n\r\n\"Here is the result of my calculations,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\"A shot of 108 inches in diameter, and twelve inches in\r\nthickness, would weigh, in cast-iron, 67,440 pounds; cast in\r\naluminum, its weight will be reduced to 19,250 pounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Capital!\" cried the major; \"but do you know that, at nine\r\ndollars a pound, this projectile will cost----\"\r\n\r\n\"One hundred and seventy-three thousand and fifty dollars ($173,050).\r\nI know it quite well.  But fear not, my friends; the money will not\r\nbe wanting for our enterprise.  I will answer for it.  Now what say\r\nyou to aluminum, gentlemen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Adopted!\" replied the three members of the committee.  So ended\r\nthe first meeting.  The question of the projectile was\r\ndefinitely settled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE CANNON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe resolutions passed at the last meeting produced a great\r\neffect out of doors.  Timid people took fright at the idea of\r\na shot weighing 20,000 pounds being launched into space; they\r\nasked what cannon could ever transmit a sufficient velocity to\r\nsuch a mighty mass.  The minutes of the second meeting were\r\ndestined triumphantly to answer such questions.  The following\r\nevening the discussion was renewed.\r\n\r\n\"My dear colleagues,\" said Barbicane, without further preamble,\r\n\"the subject now before us is the construction of the engine,\r\nits length, its composition, and its weight.  It is probable\r\nthat we shall end by giving it gigantic dimensions; but however\r\ngreat may be the difficulties in the way, our mechanical genius\r\nwill readily surmount them.  Be good enough, then, to give me\r\nyour attention, and do not hesitate to make objections at the close.\r\nI have no fear of them.  The problem before us is how to communicate\r\nan initial force of 12,000 yards per second to a shell of 108\r\ninches in diameter, weighing 20,000 pounds.  Now when a projectile\r\nis launched into space, what happens to it?  It is acted upon by\r\nthree independent forces:  the resistance of the air, the attraction\r\nof the earth, and the force of impulsion with which it is endowed.\r\nLet us examine these three forces.  The resistance of the air is of\r\nlittle importance.  The atmosphere of the earth does not exceed\r\nforty miles.  Now, with the given rapidity, the projectile will\r\nhave traversed this in five seconds, and the period is too brief\r\nfor the resistance of the medium to be regarded otherwise than\r\nas insignificant.  Proceding, then, to the attraction of the earth,\r\nthat is, the weight of the shell, we know that this weight will\r\ndiminish in the inverse ratio of the square of the distance.\r\nWhen a body left to itself falls to the surface of the earth, it\r\nfalls five feet in the first second; and if the same body were\r\nremoved 257,542 miles further off, in other words, to the distance\r\nof the moon, its fall would be reduced to about half a line in the\r\nfirst second.  That is almost equivalent to a state of perfect rest.\r\nOur business, then, is to overcome progressively this action\r\nof gravitation.  The mode of accomplishing that is by the force\r\nof impulsion.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's the difficulty,\" broke in the major.\r\n\r\n\"True,\" replied the president; \"but we will overcome that, for\r\nthe force of impulsion will depend on the length of the engine\r\nand the powder employed, the latter being limited only by the\r\nresisting power of the former.  Our business, then, to-day is\r\nwith the dimensions of the cannon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, up to the present time,\" said Barbicane, \"our longest guns\r\nhave not exceeded twenty-five feet in length.  We shall\r\ntherefore astonish the world by the dimensions we shall be\r\nobliged to adopt.  It must evidently be, then, a gun of great\r\nrange, since the length of the piece will increase the detention\r\nof the gas accumulated behind the projectile; but there is no\r\nadvantage in passing certain limits.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so,\" said the major.  \"What is the rule in such a case?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ordinarily the length of a gun is twenty to twenty-five times\r\nthe diameter of the shot, and its weight two hundred and\r\nthirty-five to two hundred and forty times that of the shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not enough,\" cried J. T. Maston impetuously.\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you, my good friend; and, in fact, following this\r\nproportion for a projectile nine feet in diameter, weighing 30,000\r\npounds, the gun would only have a length of two hundred and twenty-\r\nfive feet, and a weight of 7,200,000 pounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ridiculous!\" rejoined Maston.  \"As well take a pistol.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so too,\" replied Barbicane; \"that is why I propose to\r\nquadruple that length, and to construct a gun of nine hundred feet.\"\r\n\r\nThe general and the major offered some objections; nevertheless,\r\nthe proposition, actively supported by the secretary, was\r\ndefinitely adopted.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Elphinstone, \"what thickness must we give it?\"\r\n\r\n\"A thickness of six feet,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"You surely don't think of mounting a mass like that upon a\r\ncarriage?\" asked the major.\r\n\r\n\"It would be a superb idea, though,\" said Maston.\r\n\r\n\"But impracticable,\" replied Barbicane.  \"No, I think of sinking\r\nthis engine in the earth alone, binding it with hoops of wrought\r\niron, and finally surrounding it with a thick mass of masonry of\r\nstone and cement.  The piece once cast, it must be bored with\r\ngreat precision, so as to preclude any possible windage.  So there\r\nwill be no loss whatever of gas, and all the expansive force of\r\nthe powder will be employed in the propulsion.\"\r\n\r\n\"One simple question,\" said Elphinstone:  \"is our gun to be rifled?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, certainly not,\" replied Barbicane; \"we require an enormous\r\ninitial velocity; and you are well aware that a shot quits a\r\nrifled gun less rapidly than it does a smooth-bore.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" rejoined the major.\r\n\r\nThe committee here adjourned for a few minutes to tea and sandwiches.\r\n\r\nOn the discussion being renewed, \"Gentlemen,\" said Barbicane,\r\n\"we must now take into consideration the metal to be employed.\r\nOur cannon must be possessed of great tenacity, great hardness,\r\nbe infusible by heat, indissoluble, and inoxidable by the\r\ncorrosive action of acids.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no doubt about that,\" replied the major; \"and as we\r\nshall have to employ an immense quantity of metal, we shall not\r\nbe at a loss for choice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said Morgan, \"I propose the best alloy hitherto\r\nknown, which consists of one hundred parts of copper, twelve of\r\ntin, and six of brass.\"\r\n\r\n\"I admit,\" replied the president, \"that this composition has\r\nyielded excellent results, but in the present case it would be\r\ntoo expensive, and very difficult to work.  I think, then, that\r\nwe ought to adopt a material excellent in its way and of low\r\nprice, such as cast iron.  What is your advice, major?\"\r\n\r\n\"I quite agree with you,\" replied Elphinstone.\r\n\r\n\"In fact,\" continued Barbicane, \"cast iron costs ten times less\r\nthan bronze; it is easy to cast, it runs readily from the moulds\r\nof sand, it is easy of manipulation, it is at once economical of\r\nmoney and of time.  In addition, it is excellent as a material,\r\nand I well remember that during the war, at the siege of\r\nAtlanta, some iron guns fired one thousand rounds at intervals\r\nof twenty minutes without injury.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cast iron is very brittle, though,\" replied Morgan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but it possesses great resistance.  I will now ask our\r\nworthy secretary to calculate the weight of a cast-iron gun with\r\na bore of nine feet and a thickness of six feet of metal.\"\r\n\r\n\"In a moment,\" replied Maston.  Then, dashing off some\r\nalgebraical formulae with marvelous facility, in a minute or two\r\nhe declared the following result:\r\n\r\n\"The cannon will weigh 68,040 tons.  And, at two cents a pound,\r\nit will cost----\"\r\n\r\n\"Two million five hundred and ten thousand seven hundred and\r\none dollars.\"\r\n\r\nMaston, the major, and the general regarded Barbicane with\r\nuneasy looks.\r\n\r\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" replied the president, \"I repeat what I\r\nsaid yesterday.  Make yourselves easy; the millions will not\r\nbe wanting.\"\r\n\r\nWith this assurance of their president the committee separated,\r\nafter having fixed their third meeting for the following evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF THE POWDERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere remained for consideration merely the question of powders.\r\nThe public awaited with interest its final decision.  The size\r\nof the projectile, the length of the cannon being settled, what\r\nwould be the quantity of powder necessary to produce impulsion?\r\n\r\nIt is generally asserted that gunpowder was invented in the\r\nfourteenth century by the monk Schwartz, who paid for his grand\r\ndiscovery with his life.  It is, however, pretty well proved\r\nthat this story ought to be ranked among the legends of the\r\nmiddle ages.  Gunpowder was not invented by any one; it was the\r\nlineal successor of the Greek fire, which, like itself, was\r\ncomposed of sulfur and saltpeter.  Few persons are acquainted\r\nwith the mechanical power of gunpowder.  Now this is precisely\r\nwhat is necessary to be understood in order to comprehend the\r\nimportance of the question submitted to the committee.\r\n\r\nA litre of gunpowder weighs about two pounds; during combustion\r\nit produces 400 litres of gas.  This gas, on being liberated and\r\nacted upon by temperature raised to 2,400 degrees, occupies a\r\nspace of 4,000 litres:  consequently the volume of powder is to\r\nthe volume of gas produced by its combustion as 1 to 4,000.\r\nOne may judge, therefore, of the tremendous pressure on this\r\ngas when compressed within a space 4,000 times too confined.\r\nAll this was, of course, well known to the members of the committee\r\nwhen they met on the following evening.\r\n\r\nThe first speaker on this occasion was Major Elphinstone, who\r\nhad been the director of the gunpowder factories during the war.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said this distinguished chemist, \"I begin with\r\nsome figures which will serve as the basis of our calculation.\r\nThe old 24-pounder shot required for its discharge sixteen pounds\r\nof powder.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are certain of this amount?\" broke in Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Quite certain,\" replied the major.  \"The Armstrong cannon\r\nemploys only seventy-five pounds of powder for a projectile\r\nof eight hundred pounds, and the Rodman Columbiad uses only one\r\nhundred and sixty pounds of powder to send its half ton shot a\r\ndistance of six miles.  These facts cannot be called in question,\r\nfor I myself raised the point during the depositions taken before\r\nthe committee of artillery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite true,\" said the general.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied the major, \"these figures go to prove that the\r\nquantity of powder is not increased with the weight of the shot;\r\nthat is to say, if a 24-pounder shot requires sixteen pounds of\r\npowder;-- in other words, if in ordinary guns we employ a\r\nquantity of powder equal to two-thirds of the weight of the\r\nprojectile, this proportion is not constant.  Calculate, and you\r\nwill see that in place of three hundred and thirty-three pounds\r\nof powder, the quantity is reduced to no more than one hundred\r\nand sixty pounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you aiming at?\" asked the president.\r\n\r\n\"If you push your theory to extremes, my dear major,\" said J. T.\r\nMaston, \"you will get to this, that as soon as your shot becomes\r\nsufficiently heavy you will not require any powder at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our friend Maston is always at his jokes, even in serious\r\nmatters,\" cried the major; \"but let him make his mind easy, I am\r\ngoing presently to propose gunpowder enough to satisfy his\r\nartillerist's propensities.  I only keep to statistical facts\r\nwhen I say that, during the war, and for the very largest guns,\r\nthe weight of the powder was reduced, as the result of\r\nexperience, to a tenth part of the weight of the shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly correct,\" said Morgan; \"but before deciding the\r\nquantity of powder necessary to give the impulse, I think it\r\nwould be as well----\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to employ a large-grained powder,\" continued the\r\nmajor; \"its combustion is more rapid than that of the small.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt about that,\" replied Morgan; \"but it is very\r\ndestructive, and ends by enlarging the bore of the pieces.\"\r\n\r\n\"Granted; but that which is injurious to a gun destined to\r\nperform long service is not so to our Columbiad.  We shall\r\nrun no danger of an explosion; and it is necessary that our\r\npowder should take fire instantaneously in order that its\r\nmechanical effect may be complete.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must have,\" said Maston, \"several touch-holes, so as to fire\r\nit at different points at the same time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied Elphinstone; \"but that will render the\r\nworking of the piece more difficult.  I return then to my\r\nlarge-grained powder, which removes those difficulties.\r\nIn his Columbiad charges Rodman employed a powder as large\r\nas chestnuts, made of willow charcoal, simply dried in cast-\r\niron pans.  This powder was hard and glittering, left no trace\r\nupon the hand, contained hydrogen and oxygen in large proportion,\r\ntook fire instantaneously, and, though very destructive, did not\r\nsensibly injure the mouth-piece.\"\r\n\r\nUp to this point Barbicane had kept aloof from the discussion;\r\nhe left the others to speak while he himself listened; he had\r\nevidently got an idea.  He now simply said, \"Well, my friends,\r\nwhat quantity of powder do you propose?\"\r\n\r\nThe three members looked at one another.\r\n\r\n\"Two hundred thousand pounds.\" at last said Morgan.\r\n\r\n\"Five hundred thousand,\" added the major.\r\n\r\n\"Eight hundred thousand,\" screamed Maston.\r\n\r\nA moment of silence followed this triple proposal; it was at\r\nlast broken by the president.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" he quietly said, \"I start from this principle, that\r\nthe resistance of a gun, constructed under the given conditions,\r\nis unlimited.  I shall surprise our friend Maston, then, by\r\nstigmatizing his calculations as timid; and I propose to double\r\nhis 800,000 pounds of powder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sixteen hundred thousand pounds?\" shouted Maston, leaping from\r\nhis seat.\r\n\r\n\"Just so.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to come then to my ideal of a cannon half a mile\r\nlong; for you see 1,600,000 pounds will occupy a space of about\r\n20,000 cubic feet; and since the contents of your cannon do not\r\nexceed 54,000 cubic feet, it would be half full; and the bore\r\nwill not be more than long enough for the gas to communicate to\r\nthe projectile sufficient impulse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" said the president, \"I hold to that quantity\r\nof powder.  Now, 1,600,000 pounds of powder will create\r\n6,000,000,000 litres of gas.  Six thousand millions!\r\nYou quite understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is to be done then?\" said the general.\r\n\r\n\"The thing is very simple; we must reduce this enormous quantity\r\nof powder, while preserving to it its mechanical power.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good; but by what means?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going to tell you,\" replied Barbicane quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is more easy than to reduce this mass to one quarter of\r\nits bulk.  You know that curious cellular matter which\r\nconstitutes the elementary tissues of vegetable?  This substance\r\nis found quite pure in many bodies, especially in cotton, which\r\nis nothing more than the down of the seeds of the cotton plant.\r\nNow cotton, combined with cold nitric acid, become transformed\r\ninto a substance eminently insoluble, combustible, and explosive.\r\nIt was first discovered in 1832, by Braconnot, a French chemist,\r\nwho called it xyloidine.  In 1838 another Frenchman, Pelouze,\r\ninvestigated its different properties, and finally, in 1846,\r\nSchonbein, professor of chemistry at Bale, proposed its employment\r\nfor purposes of war.  This powder, now called pyroxyle, or\r\nfulminating cotton, is prepared with great facility by simply\r\nplunging cotton for fifteen minutes in nitric acid, then washing\r\nit in water, then drying it, and it is ready for use.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing could be more simple,\" said Morgan.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, pyroxyle is unaltered by moisture-- a valuable\r\nproperty to us, inasmuch as it would take several days to charge\r\nthe cannon.  It ignites at 170 degrees in place of 240, and its\r\ncombustion is so rapid that one may set light to it on the top\r\nof the ordinary powder, without the latter having time to ignite.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfect!\" exclaimed the major.\r\n\r\n\"Only it is more expensive.\"\r\n\r\n\"What matter?\" cried J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\n\"Finally, it imparts to projectiles a velocity four times\r\nsuperior to that of gunpowder.  I will even add, that if we mix\r\nit with one-eighth of its own weight of nitrate of potassium,\r\nits expansive force is again considerably augmented.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will that be necessary?\" asked the major.\r\n\r\n\"I think not,\" replied Barbicane.  \"So, then, in place of\r\n1,600,000 pounds of powder, we shall have but 400,000 pounds of\r\nfulminating cotton; and since we can, without danger, compress\r\n500 pounds of cotton into twenty-seven cubic feet, the whole\r\nquantity will not occupy a height of more than 180 feet within\r\nthe bore of the Columbiad.  In this way the shot will have more\r\nthan 700 feet of bore to traverse under a force of 6,000,000,000\r\nlitres of gas before taking its flight toward the moon.\"\r\n\r\nAt this juncture J. T. Maston could not repress his emotion; he\r\nflung himself into the arms of his friend with the violence of\r\na projectile, and Barbicane would have been stove in if he had\r\nnot been boom-proof.\r\n\r\nThis incident terminated the third meeting of the committee.\r\n\r\nBarbicane and his bold colleagues, to whom nothing seemed\r\nimpossible, had succeeding in solving the complex problems of\r\nprojectile, cannon, and powder.  Their plan was drawn up, and it\r\nonly remained to put it into execution.\r\n\r\n\"A mere matter of detail, a bagatelle,\" said J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nONE ENEMY _v._ TWENTY-FIVE MILLIONS OF FRIENDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American public took a lively interest in the smallest\r\ndetails of the enterprise of the Gun Club.  It followed day by\r\nday the discussion of the committee.  The most simple\r\npreparations for the great experiment, the questions of figures\r\nwhich it involved, the mechanical difficulties to be resolved--\r\nin one word, the entire plan of work-- roused the popular\r\nexcitement to the highest pitch.\r\n\r\nThe purely scientific attraction was suddenly intensified by the\r\nfollowing incident:\r\n\r\nWe have seen what legions of admirers and friends Barbicane's\r\nproject had rallied round its author.  There was, however,\r\none single individual alone in all the States of the Union who\r\nprotested against the attempt of the Gun Club.  He attacked it\r\nfuriously on every opportunity, and human nature is such that\r\nBarbicane felt more keenly the opposition of that one man than\r\nhe did the applause of all the others.  He was well aware of the\r\nmotive of this antipathy, the origin of this solitary enmity,\r\nthe cause of its personality and old standing, and in what\r\nrivalry of self-love it had its rise.\r\n\r\nThis persevering enemy the president of the Gun Club had never seen.\r\nFortunate that it was so, for a meeting between the two men would\r\ncertainly have been attended with serious consequences.  This rival\r\nwas a man of science, like Barbicane himself, of a fiery, daring,\r\nand violent disposition; a pure Yankee.  His name was Captain\r\nNicholl; he lived at Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nMost people are aware of the curious struggle which arose during\r\nthe Federal war between the guns and armor of iron-plated ships.\r\nThe result was the entire reconstruction of the navy of both the\r\ncontinents; as the one grew heavier, the other became thicker\r\nin proportion.  The Merrimac, the Monitor, the Tennessee, the\r\nWeehawken discharged enormous projectiles themselves, after\r\nhaving been armor-clad against the projectiles of others.  In fact\r\nthey did to others that which they would not they should do to them--\r\nthat grand principle of immortality upon which rests the whole art\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nNow if Barbicane was a great founder of shot, Nicholl was a\r\ngreat forger of plates; the one cast night and day at Baltimore,\r\nthe other forged day and night at Philadelphia.  As soon as ever\r\nBarbicane invented a new shot, Nicholl invented a new plate;\r\neach followed a current of ideas essentially opposed to the other.\r\nHappily for these citizens, so useful to their country, a distance\r\nof from fifty to sixty miles separated them from one another, and\r\nthey had never yet met.  Which of these two inventors had the\r\nadvantage over the other it was difficult to decide from the\r\nresults obtained.  By last accounts, however, it would seem that\r\nthe armor-plate would in the end have to give way to the shot;\r\nnevertheless, there were competent judges who had their doubts\r\non the point.\r\n\r\nAt the last experiment the cylindro-conical projectiles of\r\nBarbicane stuck like so many pins in the Nicholl plates.\r\nOn that day the Philadelphia iron-forger then believed himself\r\nvictorious, and could not evince contempt enough for his rival;\r\nbut when the other afterward substituted for conical shot simple\r\n600-pound shells, at very moderate velocity, the captain was\r\nobliged to give in.  In fact, these projectiles knocked his best\r\nmetal plate to shivers.\r\n\r\nMatters were at this stage, and victory seemed to rest with the\r\nshot, when the war came to an end on the very day when Nicholl\r\nhad completed a new armor-plate of wrought steel.  It was a\r\nmasterpiece of its kind, and bid defiance to all the projectiles\r\nof the world.  The captain had it conveyed to the Polygon at\r\nWashington, challenging the president of the Gun Club to break it.\r\nBarbicane, peace having been declared, declined to try the experiment.\r\n\r\nNicholl, now furious, offered to expose his plate to the shock\r\nof any shot, solid, hollow, round, or conical.  Refused by the\r\npresident, who did not choose to compromise his last success.\r\n\r\nNicholl, disgusted by this obstinacy, tried to tempt Barbicane\r\nby offering him every chance.  He proposed to fix the plate\r\nwithin two hundred yards of the gun.  Barbicane still obstinate\r\nin refusal.  A hundred yards?  Not even seventy-five!\r\n\r\n\"At fifty then!\" roared the captain through the newspapers.\r\n\"At twenty-five yards! and I'll stand behind!\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane returned for answer that, even if Captain Nicholl\r\nwould be so good as to stand in front, he would not fire any more.\r\n\r\nNicholl could not contain himself at this reply; threw out hints\r\nof cowardice; that a man who refused to fire a cannon-shot was\r\npretty near being afraid of it; that artillerists who fight at\r\nsix miles distance are substituting mathematical formulae for\r\nindividual courage.\r\n\r\nTo these insinuations Barbicane returned no answer; perhaps he\r\nnever heard of them, so absorbed was he in the calculations for\r\nhis great enterprise.\r\n\r\nWhen his famous communication was made to the Gun Club, the\r\ncaptain's wrath passed all bounds; with his intense jealousy was\r\nmingled a feeling of absolute impotence.  How was he to invent\r\nanything to beat this 900-feet Columbiad?  What armor-plate\r\ncould ever resist a projectile of 30,000 pounds weight?\r\nOverwhelmed at first under this violent shock, he by and by\r\nrecovered himself, and resolved to crush the proposal by weight\r\nof his arguments.\r\n\r\nHe then violently attacked the labors of the Gun Club, published\r\na number of letters in the newspapers, endeavored to prove Barbicane\r\nignorant of the first principles of gunnery.  He maintained that\r\nit was absolutely impossible to impress upon any body whatever\r\na velocity of 12,000 yards per second; that even with such a\r\nvelocity a projectile of such a weight could not transcend the\r\nlimits of the earth's atmosphere.  Further still, even regarding\r\nthe velocity to be acquired, and granting it to be sufficient,\r\nthe shell could not resist the pressure of the gas developed by\r\nthe ignition of 1,600,000 pounds of powder; and supposing it to\r\nresist that pressure, it would be less able to support that\r\ntemperature; it would melt on quitting the Columbiad, and fall\r\nback in a red-hot shower upon the heads of the imprudent spectators.\r\n\r\nBarbicane continued his work without regarding these attacks.\r\n\r\nNicholl then took up the question in its other aspects.  Without\r\ntouching upon its uselessness in all points of view, he regarded\r\nthe experiment as fraught with extreme danger, both to the\r\ncitizens, who might sanction by their presence so reprehensible\r\na spectacle, and also to the towns in the neighborhood of this\r\ndeplorable cannon.  He also observed that if the projectile did\r\nnot succeed in reaching its destination (a result absolutely\r\nimpossible), it must inevitably fall back upon the earth, and\r\nthat the shock of such a mass, multiplied by the square of its\r\nvelocity, would seriously endanger every point of the globe.\r\nUnder the circumstances, therefore, and without interfering with\r\nthe rights of free citizens, it was a case for the intervention\r\nof Government, which ought not to endanger the safety of all for\r\nthe pleasure of one individual.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all his arguments, however, Captain Nicholl\r\nremained alone in his opinion.  Nobody listened to him, and he\r\ndid not succeed in alienating a single admirer from the\r\npresident of the Gun Club.  The latter did not even take the\r\npains to refute the arguments of his rival.\r\n\r\nNicholl, driven into his last entrenchments, and not able to\r\nfight personally in the cause, resolved to fight with money.\r\nHe published, therefore, in the Richmond _Inquirer_ a series of\r\nwagers, conceived in these terms, and on an increasing scale:\r\n\r\nNo. 1 ($1,000).-- That the necessary funds for the experiment\r\nof the Gun Club will not be forthcoming.\r\n\r\nNo. 2 ($2,000).-- That the operation of casting a cannon of 900\r\nfeet is impracticable, and cannot possibly succeed.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 ($3,000).-- That is it impossible to load the Columbiad,\r\nand that the pyroxyle will take fire spontaneously under the\r\npressure of the projectile.\r\n\r\nNo. 4 ($4,000).-- That the Columbiad will burst at the first fire.\r\n\r\nNo. 5 ($5,000).-- That the shot will not travel farther than six miles,\r\nand that it will fall back again a few seconds after its discharge.\r\n\r\nIt was an important sum, therefore, which the captain risked in\r\nhis invincible obstinacy.  He had no less than $15,000 at stake.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the importance of the challenge, on the 19th of\r\nMay he received a sealed packet containing the following\r\nsuperbly laconic reply:\r\n                              \"BALTIMORE, October 19.\r\n                          \"Done.\r\n                              \"BARBICANE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORIDA AND TEXAS\r\n\r\n\r\nOne question remained yet to be decided; it was necessary to\r\nchoose a favorable spot for the experiment.  According to the\r\nadvice of the Observatory of Cambridge, the gun must be fired\r\nperpendicularly to the plane of the horizon, that is to say,\r\ntoward the zenith.  Now the moon does not traverse the zenith,\r\nexcept in places situated between 0@ and 28@ of latitude.  It\r\nbecame, then, necessary to determine exactly that spot on the\r\nglobe where the immense Columbiad should be cast.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of October, at a general meeting of the Gun Club,\r\nBarbicane produced a magnificent map of the United States.\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, in opening the discussion, \"I presume that\r\nwe are all agreed that this experiment cannot and ought not to\r\nbe tried anywhere but within the limits of the soil of the Union.\r\nNow, by good fortune, certain frontiers of the United States\r\nextend downward as far as the 28th parallel of the north latitude.\r\nIf you will cast your eye over this map, you will see that we have at\r\nour disposal the whole of the southern portion of Texas and Florida.\"\r\n\r\nIt was finally agreed, then, that the Columbiad must be cast on\r\nthe soil of either Texas or Florida.  The result, however, of\r\nthis decision was to create a rivalry entirely without precedent\r\nbetween the different towns of these two States.\r\n\r\nThe 28th parallel, on reaching the American coast, traverses the\r\npeninsula of Florida, dividing it into two nearly equal portions.\r\nThen, plunging into the Gulf of Mexico, it subtends the arc\r\nformed by the coast of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana;\r\nthen skirting Texas, off which it cuts an angle, it continues\r\nits course over Mexico, crosses the Sonora, Old California,\r\nand loses itself in the Pacific Ocean.  It was, therefore,\r\nonly those portions of Texas and Florida which were situated\r\nbelow this parallel which came within the prescribed conditions\r\nof latitude.\r\n\r\nFlorida, in its southern part, reckons no cities of importance;\r\nit is simply studded with forts raised against the roving Indians.\r\nOne solitary town, Tampa Town, was able to put in a claim in favor\r\nof its situation.\r\n\r\nIn Texas, on the contrary, the towns are much more numerous\r\nand important.  Corpus Christi, in the county of Nueces, and all\r\nthe cities situated on the Rio Bravo, Laredo, Comalites, San\r\nIgnacio on the Web, Rio Grande City on the Starr, Edinburgh in\r\nthe Hidalgo, Santa Rita, Elpanda, Brownsville in the Cameron,\r\nformed an imposing league against the pretensions of Florida.\r\nSo, scarcely was the decision known, when the Texan and Floridan\r\ndeputies arrived at Baltimore in an incredibly short space of time.\r\nFrom that very moment President Barbicane and the influential\r\nmembers of the Gun Club were besieged day and night by\r\nformidable claims.  If seven cities of Greece contended for\r\nthe honor of having given birth to a Homer, here were two entire\r\nStates threatening to come to blows about the question of a cannon.\r\n\r\nThe rival parties promenaded the streets with arms in their hands;\r\nand at every occasion of their meeting a collision was to be\r\napprehended which might have been attended with disastrous results.\r\nHappily the prudence and address of President Barbicane averted\r\nthe danger.  These personal demonstrations found a division in\r\nthe newspapers of the different States.  The New York _Herald_ and\r\nthe _Tribune_ supported Texas, while the _Times_ and the _American\r\nReview_ espoused the cause of the Floridan deputies.  The members\r\nof the Gun Club could not decide to which to give the preference.\r\n\r\nTexas produced its array of twenty-six counties; Florida replied\r\nthat twelve counties were better than twenty-six in a country\r\nonly one-sixth part of the size.\r\n\r\nTexas plumed itself upon its 330,000 natives; Florida, with a\r\nfar smaller territory, boasted of being much more densely\r\npopulated with 56,000.\r\n\r\nThe Texans, through the columns of the _Herald_ claimed that\r\nsome regard should be had to a State which grew the best cotton\r\nin all America, produced the best green oak for the service of\r\nthe navy, and contained the finest oil, besides iron mines, in\r\nwhich the yield was fifty per cent. of pure metal.\r\n\r\nTo this the _American Review_ replied that the soil of Florida,\r\nalthough not equally rich, afforded the best conditions for the\r\nmoulding and casting of the Columbiad, consisting as it did of\r\nsand and argillaceous earth.\r\n\r\n\"That may be all very well,\" replied the Texans; \"but you must\r\nfirst get to this country.  Now the communications with Florida\r\nare difficult, while the coast of Texas offers the bay of\r\nGalveston, which possesses a circumference of fourteen leagues,\r\nand is capable of containing the navies of the entire world!\"\r\n\r\n\"A pretty notion truly,\" replied the papers in the interest of\r\nFlorida, \"that of Galveston bay _below the 29th parallel!_\r\nHave we not got the bay of Espiritu Santo, opening precisely upon\r\n_the 28th degree_, and by which ships can reach Tampa Town by\r\ndirect route?\"\r\n\r\n\"A fine bay; half choked with sand!\"\r\n\r\n\"Choked yourselves!\" returned the others.\r\n\r\nThus the war went on for several days, when Florida endeavored\r\nto draw her adversary away on to fresh ground; and one morning\r\nthe _Times_ hinted that, the enterprise being essentially\r\nAmerican, it ought not to be attempted upon other than purely\r\nAmerican territory.\r\n\r\nTo these words Texas retorted, \"American! are we not as much so\r\nas you?  Were not Texas and Florida both incorporated into the\r\nUnion in 1845?\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly,\" replied the _Times_; \"but we have belonged to the\r\nAmericans ever since 1820.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" returned the _Tribune_; \"after having been Spaniards or\r\nEnglish for two hundred years, you were sold to the United\r\nStates for five million dollars!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well! and why need we blush for that?  Was not Louisiana bought\r\nfrom Napoleon in 1803 at the price of sixteen million dollars?\"\r\n\r\n\"Scandalous!\" roared the Texas deputies.  \"A wretched little\r\nstrip of country like Florida to dare to compare itself to\r\nTexas, who, in place of selling herself, asserted her own\r\nindependence, drove out the Mexicans in March 2, 1846, and\r\ndeclared herself a federal republic after the victory gained by\r\nSamuel Houston, on the banks of the San Jacinto, over the troops\r\nof Santa Anna!-- a country, in fine, which voluntarily annexed\r\nitself to the United States of America!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; because it was afraid of the Mexicans!\" replied Florida.\r\n\r\n\"Afraid!\"  From this moment the state of things became intolerable.\r\nA sanguinary encounter seemed daily imminent between the two\r\nparties in the streets of Baltimore.  It became necessary to keep\r\nan eye upon the deputies.\r\n\r\nPresident Barbicane knew not which way to look.  Notes, documents,\r\nletters full of menaces showered down upon his house.  Which side\r\nought he to take?  As regarded the appropriation of the soil, the\r\nfacility of communication, the rapidity of transport, the claims\r\nof both States were evenly balanced.  As for political prepossessions,\r\nthey had nothing to do with the question.\r\n\r\nThis dead block had existed for some little time, when Barbicane\r\nresolved to get rid of it all at once.  He called a meeting of\r\nhis colleagues, and laid before them a proposition which, it will\r\nbe seen, was profoundly sagacious.\r\n\r\n\"On carefully considering,\" he said, \"what is going on now\r\nbetween Florida and Texas, it is clear that the same\r\ndifficulties will recur with all the towns of the favored State.\r\nThe rivalry will descend from State to city, and so on downward.\r\nNow Texas possesses eleven towns within the prescribed\r\nconditions, which will further dispute the honor and create us\r\nnew enemies, while Florida has only one.  I go in, therefore,\r\nfor Florida and Tampa Town.\"\r\n\r\nThis decision, on being made known, utterly crushed the\r\nTexan deputies.  Seized with an indescribable fury, they\r\naddressed threatening letters to the different members of the\r\nGun Club by name.  The magistrates had but one course to take,\r\nand they took it.  They chartered a special train, forced the\r\nTexans into it whether they would or no; and they quitted the\r\ncity with a speed of thirty miles an hour.\r\n\r\nQuickly, however, as they were despatched, they found time to\r\nhurl one last and bitter sarcasm at their adversaries.\r\n\r\nAlluding to the extent of Florida, a mere peninsula confined\r\nbetween two seas, they pretended that it could never sustain\r\nthe shock of the discharge, and that it would \"bust up\" at the\r\nvery first shot.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, let it bust up!\" replied the Floridans, with a\r\nbrevity of the days of ancient Sparta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nURBI ET ORBI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe astronomical, mechanical, and topographical difficulties\r\nresolved, finally came the question of finance.  The sum\r\nrequired was far too great for any individual, or even any\r\nsingle State, to provide the requisite millions.\r\n\r\nPresident Barbicane undertook, despite of the matter being a\r\npurely American affair, to render it one of universal interest,\r\nand to request the financial co-operation of all peoples.\r\nIt was, he maintained, the right and duty of the whole earth\r\nto interfere in the affairs of its satellite.  The subscription\r\nopened at Baltimore extended properly to the whole world-- _Urbi\r\net orbi_.\r\n\r\nThis subscription was successful beyond all expectation;\r\nnotwithstanding that it was a question not of lending but of\r\ngiving the money.  It was a purely disinterested operation in\r\nthe strictest sense of the term, and offered not the slightest\r\nchance of profit.\r\n\r\nThe effect, however, of Barbicane's communication was not\r\nconfined to the frontiers of the United States; it crossed\r\nthe Atlantic and Pacific, invading simultaneously Asia and\r\nEurope, Africa and Oceanica.  The observatories of the Union\r\nplaced themselves in immediate communication with those of\r\nforeign countries.  Some, such as those of Paris, Petersburg,\r\nBerlin, Stockholm, Hamburg, Malta, Lisbon, Benares, Madras,\r\nand others, transmitted their good wishes; the rest maintained\r\na prudent silence, quietly awaiting the result.  As for the\r\nobservatory at Greenwich, seconded as it was by the twenty-\r\ntwo astronomical establishments of Great Britain, it spoke\r\nplainly enough.  It boldly denied the possibility of success,\r\nand pronounced in favor of the theories of Captain Nicholl.\r\nBut this was nothing more than mere English jealousy.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of October President Barbicane published a manifesto\r\nfull of enthusiasm, in which he made an appeal to \"all persons\r\nof good will upon the face of the earth.\"  This document,\r\ntranslated into all languages, met with immense success.\r\n\r\nSubscription lists were opened in all the principal cities of\r\nthe Union, with a central office at the Baltimore Bank, 9\r\nBaltimore Street.\r\n\r\nIn addition, subscriptions were received at the following banks\r\nin the different states of the two continents:\r\n\r\n     At Vienna, with S. M. de Rothschild.\r\n     At Petersburg, Stieglitz and Co.\r\n     At Paris, The Credit Mobilier.\r\n     At Stockholm, Tottie and Arfuredson.\r\n     At London, N. M. Rothschild and Son.\r\n     At Turin, Ardouin and Co.\r\n     At Berlin, Mendelssohn.\r\n     At Geneva, Lombard, Odier and Co.\r\n     At Constantinople, The Ottoman Bank.\r\n     At Brussels, J. Lambert.\r\n     At Madrid, Daniel Weisweller.\r\n     At Amsterdam, Netherlands Credit Co.\r\n     At Rome, Torlonia and Co.\r\n     At Lisbon, Lecesne.\r\n     At Copenhagen, Private Bank.\r\n     At Rio de Janeiro, Private Bank.\r\n     At Montevideo, Private Bank.\r\n     At Valparaiso and Lima, Thomas la Chambre and Co.\r\n     At Mexico, Martin Daran and Co.\r\n\r\nThree days after the manifesto of President Barbicane $4,000,000\r\nwere paid into the different towns of the Union.  With such a\r\nbalance the Gun Club might begin operations at once.  But some\r\ndays later advices were received to the effect that foreign\r\nsubscriptions were being eagerly taken up.  Certain countries\r\ndistinguished themselves by their liberality; others untied\r\ntheir purse-strings with less facility--a matter of temperament.\r\nFigures are, however, more eloquent than words, and here is the\r\nofficial statement of the sums which were paid in to the credit\r\nof the Gun Club at the close of the subscription.\r\n\r\nRussia paid in as her contingent the enormous sum of 368,733 roubles.\r\nNo one need be surprised at this, who bears in mind the scientific\r\ntaste of the Russians, and the impetus which they have given to\r\nastronomical studies--thanks to their numerous observatories.\r\n\r\nFrance began by deriding the pretensions of the Americans.\r\nThe moon served as a pretext for a thousand stale puns and\r\na score of ballads, in which bad taste contested the palm\r\nwith ignorance.  But as formerly the French paid before singing,\r\nso now they paid after having had their laugh, and they subscribed\r\nfor a sum of 1,253,930 francs.  At that price they had a right\r\nto enjoy themselves a little.\r\n\r\nAustria showed herself generous in the midst of her financial crisis.\r\nHer public contributions amounted to the sum of 216,000 florins--\r\na perfect godsend.\r\n\r\nFifty-two thousand rix-dollars were the remittance of Sweden\r\nand Norway; the amount is large for the country, but it would\r\nundoubtedly have been considerably increased had the\r\nsubscription been opened in Christiana simultaneously with that\r\nat Stockholm.  For some reason or other the Norwegians do not\r\nlike to send their money to Sweden.\r\n\r\nPrussia, by a remittance of 250,000 thalers, testified her high\r\napproval of the enterprise.\r\n\r\nTurkey behaved generously; but she had a personal interest in\r\nthe matter.  The moon, in fact, regulates the cycle of her years\r\nand her fast of Ramadan.  She could not do less than give\r\n1,372,640 piastres; and she gave them with an eagerness which\r\ndenoted, however, some pressure on the part of the government.\r\n\r\nBelgium distinguished herself among the second-rate states by\r\na grant of 513,000 francs-- about two centimes per head of\r\nher population.\r\n\r\nHolland and her colonies interested themselves to the extent of\r\n110,000 florins, only demanding an allowance of five per cent.\r\ndiscount for paying ready money.\r\n\r\nDenmark, a little contracted in territory, gave nevertheless\r\n9,000 ducats, proving her love for scientific experiments.\r\n\r\nThe Germanic Confederation pledged itself to 34,285 florins.\r\nIt was impossible to ask for more; besides, they would not have\r\ngiven it.\r\n\r\nThough very much crippled, Italy found 200,000 lire in the\r\npockets of her people.  If she had had Venetia she would have\r\ndone better; but she had not.\r\n\r\nThe States of the Church thought that they could not send less\r\nthan 7,040 Roman crowns; and Portugal carried her devotion to\r\nscience as far as 30,000 cruzados.  It was the widow's mite--\r\neighty-six piastres; but self-constituted empires are always\r\nrather short of money.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and fifty-seven francs, this was the modest\r\ncontribution of Switzerland to the American work.  One must\r\nfreely admit that she did not see the practical side of\r\nthe matter.  It did not seem to her that the mere despatch of\r\na shot to the moon could possibly establish any relation of\r\naffairs with her; and it did not seem prudent to her to embark\r\nher capital in so hazardous an enterprise.  After all, perhaps\r\nshe was right.\r\n\r\nAs to Spain, she could not scrape together more than 110 reals.\r\nShe gave as an excuse that she had her railways to finish.\r\nThe truth is, that science is not favorably regarded in that\r\ncountry, it is still in a backward state; and moreover, certain\r\nSpaniards, not by any means the least educated, did not form a\r\ncorrect estimate of the bulk of the projectile compared with\r\nthat of the moon.  They feared that it would disturb the\r\nestablished order of things.  In that case it were better to\r\nkeep aloof; which they did to the tune of some reals.\r\n\r\nThere remained but England; and we know the contemptuous\r\nantipathy with which she received Barbicane's proposition.\r\nThe English have but one soul for the whole twenty-six millions\r\nof inhabitants which Great Britain contains.  They hinted that\r\nthe enterprise of the Gun Club was contrary to the \"principle of\r\nnon-intervention.\"  And they did not subscribe a single farthing.\r\n\r\nAt this intimation the Gun Club merely shrugged its shoulders\r\nand returned to its great work.  When South America, that is to\r\nsay, Peru, Chili, Brazil, the provinces of La Plata and Columbia,\r\nhad poured forth their quota into their hands, the sum of $300,000,\r\nit found itself in possession of a considerable capital, of which\r\nthe following is a statement:\r\n\r\n     United States subscriptions, .     .  $4,000,000\r\n     Foreign subscriptions  .     .     .  $1,446,675\r\n                                          -----------\r\n            Total,    .     .     .     .  $5,446,675\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the sum which the public poured into the treasury of\r\nthe Gun Club.\r\n\r\nLet no one be surprised at the vastness of the amount.  The work\r\nof casting, boring, masonry, the transport of workmen, their\r\nestablishment in an almost uninhabited country, the construction\r\nof furnaces and workshops, the plant, the powder, the projectile,\r\nand incipient expenses, would, according to the estimates, absorb\r\nnearly the whole.  Certain cannon-shots in the Federal war cost\r\none thousand dollars apiece.  This one of President Barbicane,\r\nunique in the annals of gunnery, might well cost five thousand\r\ntimes more.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of October a contract was entered into with the\r\nmanufactory at Coldspring, near New York, which during the war\r\nhad furnished the largest Parrott, cast-iron guns.  It was\r\nstipulated between the contracting parties that the manufactory\r\nof Coldspring should engage to transport to Tampa Town,\r\nin southern Florida, the necessary materials for casting\r\nthe Columbiad.  The work was bound to be completed at latest\r\nby the 15th of October following, and the cannon delivered\r\nin good condition under penalty of a forfeit of one hundred\r\ndollars a day to the moment when the moon should again present\r\nherself under the same conditions-- that is to say, in eighteen\r\nyears and eleven days.\r\n\r\nThe engagement of the workmen, their pay, and all the necessary\r\ndetails of the work, devolved upon the Coldspring Company.\r\n\r\nThis contract, executed in duplicate, was signed by Barbicane,\r\npresident of the Gun Club, of the one part, and T. Murchison\r\ndirector of the Coldspring manufactory, of the other, who thus\r\nexecuted the deed on behalf of their respective principals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nSTONES HILL\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the decision was arrived at by the Gun Club, to the\r\ndisparagement of Texas, every one in America, where reading is\r\na universal acquirement, set to work to study the geography\r\nof Florida.  Never before had there been such a sale for works\r\nlike \"Bertram's Travels in Florida,\" \"Roman's Natural History of\r\nEast and West Florida,\" \"William's Territory of Florida,\" and\r\n\"Cleland on the Cultivation of the Sugar-Cane in Florida.\"\r\nIt became necessary to issue fresh editions of these works.\r\n\r\nBarbicane had something better to do than to read.  He desired\r\nto see things with his own eyes, and to mark the exact position\r\nof the proposed gun.  So, without a moment's loss of time, he\r\nplaced at the disposal of the Cambridge Observatory the funds\r\nnecessary for the construction of a telescope, and entered into\r\nnegotiations with the house of Breadwill and Co., of Albany, for\r\nthe construction of an aluminum projectile of the required size.\r\nHe then quitted Baltimore, accompanied by J. T. Maston, Major\r\nElphinstone, and the manager of the Coldspring factory.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the four fellow-travelers arrived at\r\nNew Orleans.  There they immediately embarked on board the\r\n_Tampico_, a despatch-boat belonging to the Federal navy, which\r\nthe government had placed at their disposal; and, getting up\r\nsteam, the banks of Louisiana speedily disappeared from sight.\r\n\r\nThe passage was not long.  Two days after starting, the _Tampico_,\r\nhaving made four hundred and eighty miles, came in sight of the\r\ncoast of Florida.  On a nearer approach Barbicane found himself\r\nin view of a low, flat country of somewhat barren aspect.\r\nAfter coasting along a series of creeks abounding in lobsters\r\nand oysters, the _Tampico_ entered the bay of Espiritu Santo,\r\nwhere she finally anchored in a small natural harbor, formed by\r\nthe _embouchure_ of the River Hillisborough, at seven P.M., on\r\nthe 22d of October.\r\n\r\nOur four passengers disembarked at once.  \"Gentlemen,\" said\r\nBarbicane, \"we have no time to lose; tomorrow we must obtain\r\nhorses, and proceed to reconnoiter the country.\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane had scarcely set his foot on shore when three thousand\r\nof the inhabitants of Tampa Town came forth to meet him, an\r\nhonor due to the president who had signalized their country by\r\nhis choice.\r\n\r\nDeclining, however, every kind of ovation, Barbicane ensconced\r\nhimself in a room of the Franklin Hotel.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow some of the small horses of the Spanish breed,\r\nfull of vigor and of fire, stood snorting under his windows;\r\nbut instead of four steeds, here were fifty, together with\r\ntheir riders.  Barbicane descended with his three fellow-\r\ntravelers; and much astonished were they all to find themselves\r\nin the midst of such a cavalcade.  He remarked that every\r\nhorseman carried a carbine slung across his shoulders and\r\npistols in his holsters.\r\n\r\nOn expressing his surprise at these preparations, he was\r\nspeedily enlightened by a young Floridan, who quietly said:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, there are Seminoles there.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by Seminoles?\"\r\n\r\n\"Savages who scour the prairies.  We thought it best, therefore,\r\nto escort you on your road.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pooh!\" cried J. T. Maston, mounting his steed.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said the Floridan; \"but it is true enough, nevertheless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" answered Barbicane, \"I thank you for your kind\r\nattention; but it is time to be off.\"\r\n\r\nIt was five A.M. when Barbicane and his party, quitting Tampa Town,\r\nmade their way along the coast in the direction of Alifia Creek.\r\nThis little river falls into Hillisborough Bay twelve miles above\r\nTampa Town.  Barbicane and his escort coasted along its right bank\r\nto the eastward.  Soon the waves of the bay disappeared behind a\r\nbend of rising ground, and the Floridan \"champagne\" alone offered\r\nitself to view.\r\n\r\nFlorida, discovered on Palm Sunday, in 1512, by Juan Ponce de\r\nLeon, was originally named _Pascha Florida_.  It little deserved\r\nthat designation, with its dry and parched coasts.  But after\r\nsome few miles of tract the nature of the soil gradually changes\r\nand the country shows itself worthy of the name.  Cultivated plains\r\nsoon appear, where are united all the productions of the northern\r\nand tropical floras, terminating in prairies abounding with\r\npineapples and yams, tobacco, rice, cotton-plants, and sugar-canes,\r\nwhich extend beyond reach of sight, flinging their riches broadcast\r\nwith careless prodigality.\r\n\r\nBarbicane appeared highly pleased on observing the progressive\r\nelevation of the land; and in answer to a question of J. T.\r\nMaston, replied:\r\n\r\n\"My worthy friend, we cannot do better than sink our Columbiad\r\nin these high grounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"To get nearer the moon, perhaps?\" said the secretary of the Gun Club.\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly,\" replied Barbicane, smiling; \"do you not see that\r\namong these elevated plateaus we shall have a much easier work\r\nof it?  No struggles with the water-springs, which will save us\r\nlong expensive tubings; and we shall be working in daylight\r\ninstead of down a deep and narrow well.  Our business, then, is\r\nto open our trenches upon ground some hundreds of yards above\r\nthe level of the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, sir,\" struck in Murchison, the engineer; \"and, if I\r\nmistake not, we shall ere long find a suitable spot for our purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish we were at the first stroke of the pickaxe,\" said the president.\r\n\r\n\"And I wish we were at the _last_,\" cried J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\nAbout ten A.M. the little band had crossed a dozen miles.\r\nTo fertile plains succeeded a region of forests.  There perfumes\r\nof the most varied kinds mingled together in tropical profusion.\r\nThese almost impenetrable forests were composed of pomegranates,\r\norange-trees, citrons, figs, olives, apricots, bananas, huge vines,\r\nwhose blossoms and fruits rivaled each other in color and perfume.\r\nBeneath the odorous shade of these magnificent trees fluttered and\r\nwarbled a little world of brilliantly plumaged birds.\r\n\r\nJ. T. Maston and the major could not repress their admiration on\r\nfinding themselves in the presence of the glorious beauties of\r\nthis wealth of nature.  President Barbicane, however, less\r\nsensitive to these wonders, was in haste to press forward;\r\nthe very luxuriance of the country was displeasing to him.\r\nThey hastened onward, therefore, and were compelled to ford\r\nseveral rivers, not without danger, for they were infested\r\nwith huge alligators from fifteen to eighteen feet long.\r\nMaston courageously menaced them with his steel hook, but he\r\nonly succeeded in frightening some pelicans and teal, while\r\ntall flamingos stared stupidly at the party.\r\n\r\nAt length these denizens of the swamps disappeared in their\r\nturn; smaller trees became thinly scattered among less dense\r\nthickets-- a few isolated groups detached in the midst of\r\nendless plains over which ranged herds of startled deer.\r\n\r\n\"At last,\" cried Barbicane, rising in his stirrups, \"here we are\r\nat the region of pines!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! and of savages too,\" replied the major.\r\n\r\nIn fact, some Seminoles had just came in sight upon the horizon;\r\nthey rode violently backward and forward on their fleet horses,\r\nbrandishing their spears or discharging their guns with a dull report.\r\nThese hostile demonstrations, however, had no effect upon Barbicane\r\nand his companions.\r\n\r\nThey were then occupying the center of a rocky plain, which the\r\nsun scorched with its parching rays.  This was formed by a\r\nconsiderable elevation of the soil, which seemed to offer to the\r\nmembers of the Gun Club all the conditions requisite for the\r\nconstruction of their Columbiad.\r\n\r\n\"Halt!\" said Barbicane, reining up.  \"Has this place any\r\nlocal appellation?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is called Stones Hill,\" replied one of the Floridans.\r\n\r\nBarbicane, without saying a word, dismounted, seized his instruments,\r\nand began to note his position with extreme exactness.  The little\r\nband, drawn up in the rear, watched his proceedings in profound silence.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the sun passed the meridian.  Barbicane, after a\r\nfew moments, rapidly wrote down the result of his observations,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\"This spot is situated eighteen hundred feet above the level of\r\nthe sea, in 27@ 7' N. lat. and 5@ 7' W. long. of the meridian\r\nof Washington.  It appears to me by its rocky and barren character\r\nto offer all the conditions requisite for our experiment.  On that\r\nplain will be raised our magazines, workshops, furnaces, and\r\nworkmen's huts; and here, from this very spot,\" said he, stamping\r\nhis foot on the summit of Stones Hill, \"hence shall our projectile\r\ntake its flight into the regions of the Solar World.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nPICKAXE AND TROWEL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same evening Barbicane and his companions returned to Tampa\r\nTown; and Murchison, the engineer, re-embarked on board the\r\nTampico for New Orleans.  His object was to enlist an army of\r\nworkmen, and to collect together the greater part of the materials.\r\nThe members of the Gun Club remained at Tampa Town, for the\r\npurpose of setting on foot the preliminary works by the aid of\r\nthe people of the country.\r\n\r\nEight days after its departure, the Tampico returned into the\r\nbay of Espiritu Santo, with a whole flotilla of steamboats.\r\nMurchison had succeeded in assembling together fifteen\r\nhundred artisans.  Attracted by the high pay and considerable\r\nbounties offered by the Gun Club, he had enlisted a choice\r\nlegion of stokers, iron-founders, lime-burners, miners,\r\nbrickmakers, and artisans of every trade, without distinction\r\nof color.  As many of these people brought their families with\r\nthem, their departure resembled a perfect emigration.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of October, at ten o'clock in the morning, the troop\r\ndisembarked on the quays of Tampa Town; and one may imagine the\r\nactivity which pervaded that little town, whose population was\r\nthus doubled in a single day.\r\n\r\nDuring the first few days they were busy discharging the cargo\r\nbrought by the flotilla, the machines, and the rations, as well\r\nas a large number of huts constructed of iron plates, separately\r\npieced and numbered.  At the same period Barbicane laid the\r\nfirst sleepers of a railway fifteen miles in length, intended to\r\nunite Stones Hill with Tampa Town.  On the first of November\r\nBarbicane quitted Tampa Town with a detachment of workmen; and\r\non the following day the whole town of huts was erected round\r\nStones Hill.  This they enclosed with palisades; and in respect\r\nof energy and activity, it might have been mistaken for one of\r\nthe great cities of the Union.  Everything was placed under a\r\ncomplete system of discipline, and the works were commenced in\r\nmost perfect order.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the soil having been carefully examined, by means\r\nof repeated borings, the work of excavation was fixed for the\r\n4th of November.\r\n\r\nOn that day Barbicane called together his foremen and addressed\r\nthem as follows:  \"You are well aware, my friends, of the\r\nobject with which I have assembled you together in this wild\r\npart of Florida.  Our business is to construct a cannon measuring\r\nnine feet in its interior diameter, six feet thick, and with a\r\nstone revetment of nineteen and a half feet in thickness.  We have,\r\ntherefore, a well of sixty feet in diameter to dig down to a\r\ndepth of nine hundred feet.  This great work must be completed\r\nwithin eight months, so that you have 2,543,400 cubic feet of\r\nearth to excavate in 255 days; that is to say, in round numbers,\r\n2,000 cubic feet per day.  That which would present no difficulty\r\nto a thousand navvies working in open country will be of course\r\nmore troublesome in a comparatively confined space.  However, the\r\nthing must be done, and I reckon for its accomplishment upon your\r\ncourage as much as upon your skill.\"\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock the next morning the first stroke of the\r\npickaxe was struck upon the soil of Florida; and from that\r\nmoment that prince of tools was never inactive for one moment\r\nin the hands of the excavators.  The gangs relieved each other\r\nevery three hours.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of November fifty workmen commenced digging, in the\r\nvery center of the enclosed space on the summit of Stones Hill,\r\na circular hole sixty feet in diameter.  The pickaxe first\r\nstruck upon a kind of black earth, six inches in thickness,\r\nwhich was speedily disposed of.  To this earth succeeded two\r\nfeet of fine sand, which was carefully laid aside as being\r\nvaluable for serving the casting of the inner mould.  After the\r\nsand appeared some compact white clay, resembling the chalk of\r\nGreat Britain, which extended down to a depth of four feet.\r\nThen the iron of the picks struck upon the hard bed of the soil;\r\na kind of rock formed of petrified shells, very dry, very solid,\r\nand which the picks could with difficulty penetrate.  At this\r\npoint the excavation exhibited a depth of six and a half feet\r\nand the work of the masonry was begun.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the excavation they constructed a wheel of oak,\r\na kind of circle strongly bolted together, and of immense strength.\r\nThe center of this wooden disc was hollowed out to a diameter\r\nequal to the exterior diameter of the Columbiad.  Upon this wheel\r\nrested the first layers of the masonry, the stones of which were\r\nbound together by hydraulic cement, with irresistible tenacity.\r\nThe workmen, after laying the stones from the circumference to\r\nthe center, were thus enclosed within a kind of well twenty-one\r\nfeet in diameter.  When this work was accomplished, the miners\r\nresumed their picks and cut away the rock from underneath the wheel\r\nitself, taking care to support it as they advanced upon blocks of\r\ngreat thickness.  At every two feet which the hole gained in depth\r\nthey successively withdrew the blocks.  The wheel then sank little\r\nby little, and with it the massive ring of masonry, on the upper\r\nbed of which the masons labored incessantly, always reserving some\r\nvent holes to permit the escape of gas during the operation of\r\nthe casting.\r\n\r\nThis kind of work required on the part of the workmen extreme\r\nnicety and minute attention.  More than one, in digging\r\nunderneath the wheel, was dangerously injured by the splinters\r\nof stone.  But their ardor never relaxed, night or day.  By day\r\nthey worked under the rays of the scorching sun; by night, under\r\nthe gleam of the electric light.  The sounds of the picks against\r\nthe rock, the bursting of mines, the grinding of the machines,\r\nthe wreaths of smoke scattered through the air, traced around\r\nStones Hill a circle of terror which the herds of buffaloes and\r\nthe war parties of the Seminoles never ventured to pass.\r\nNevertheless, the works advanced regularly, as the steam-cranes\r\nactively removed the rubbish.  Of unexpected obstacles there was\r\nlittle account; and with regard to foreseen difficulties, they\r\nwere speedily disposed of.\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of the first month the well had attained the\r\ndepth assigned for that lapse of time, namely, 112 feet.  This depth\r\nwas doubled in December, and trebled in January.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of February the workmen had to contend with a\r\nsheet of water which made its way right across the outer soil.\r\nIt became necessary to employ very powerful pumps and\r\ncompressed-air engines to drain it off, so as to close up the\r\norifice from whence it issued; just as one stops a leak on\r\nboard ship.  They at last succeeded in getting the upper hand of\r\nthese untoward streams; only, in consequence of the loosening of\r\nthe soil, the wheel partly gave way, and a slight partial\r\nsettlement ensued.  This accident cost the life of several workmen.\r\n\r\nNo fresh occurrence thenceforward arrested the progress of the\r\noperation; and on the tenth of June, twenty days before the\r\nexpiration of the period fixed by Barbicane, the well, lined\r\nthroughout with its facing of stone, had attained the depth of\r\n900 feet.  At the bottom the masonry rested upon a massive block\r\nmeasuring thirty feet in thickness, while on the upper portion\r\nit was level with the surrounding soil.\r\n\r\nPresident Barbicane and the members of the Gun Club warmly\r\ncongratulated their engineer Murchison; the cyclopean work had\r\nbeen accomplished with extraordinary rapidity.\r\n\r\nDuring these eight months Barbicane never quitted Stones Hill\r\nfor a single instant.  Keeping ever close by the work of\r\nexcavation, he busied himself incessantly with the welfare\r\nand health of his workpeople, and was singularly fortunate\r\nin warding off the epidemics common to large communities of\r\nmen, and so disastrous in those regions of the globe which\r\nare exposed to the influences of tropical climates.\r\n\r\nMany workmen, it is true, paid with their lives for the rashness\r\ninherent in these dangerous labors; but these mishaps are impossible\r\nto be avoided, and they are classed among the details with which\r\nthe Americans trouble themselves but little.  They have in fact\r\nmore regard for human nature in general than for the individual\r\nin particular.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Barbicane professed opposite principles to these,\r\nand put them in force at every opportunity.  So, thanks to his\r\ncare, his intelligence, his useful intervention in all\r\ndifficulties, his prodigious and humane sagacity, the average of\r\naccidents did not exceed that of transatlantic countries, noted\r\nfor their excessive precautions-- France, for instance, among\r\nothers, where they reckon about one accident for every two\r\nhundred thousand francs of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FETE OF THE CASTING\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the eight months which were employed in the work of\r\nexcavation the preparatory works of the casting had been carried\r\non simultaneously with extreme rapidity.  A stranger arriving at\r\nStones Hill would have been surprised at the spectacle offered\r\nto his view.\r\n\r\nAt 600 yards from the well, and circularly arranged around it as\r\na central point, rose 1,200 reverberating ovens, each six feet\r\nin diameter, and separated from each other by an interval of\r\nthree feet.  The circumference occupied by these 1,200 ovens\r\npresented a length of two miles.  Being all constructed on the\r\nsame plan, each with its high quadrangular chimney, they\r\nproduced a most singular effect.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that on their third meeting the committee\r\nhad decided to use cast iron for the Columbiad, and in particular\r\nthe white description.  This metal, in fact, is the most\r\ntenacious, the most ductile, and the most malleable, and\r\nconsequently suitable for all moulding operations; and when\r\nsmelted with pit coal, is of superior quality for all\r\nengineering works requiring great resisting power, such as\r\ncannon, steam boilers, hydraulic presses, and the like.\r\n\r\nCast iron, however, if subjected to only one single fusion,\r\nis rarely sufficiently homogeneous; and it requires a second\r\nfusion completely to refine it by dispossessing it of its last\r\nearthly deposits.  So long before being forwarded to Tampa Town,\r\nthe iron ore, molten in the great furnaces of Coldspring, and\r\nbrought into contact with coal and silicium heated to a high\r\ntemperature, was carburized and transformed into cast iron.\r\nAfter this first operation, the metal was sent on to Stones Hill.\r\nThey had, however, to deal with 136,000,000 pounds of iron, a\r\nquantity far too costly to send by railway.  The cost of\r\ntransport would have been double that of material.  It appeared\r\npreferable to freight vessels at New York, and to load them with\r\nthe iron in bars.  This, however, required not less than sixty-\r\neight vessels of 1,000 tons, a veritable fleet, which, quitting\r\nNew York on the 3rd of May, on the 10th of the same month ascended\r\nthe Bay of Espiritu Santo, and discharged their cargoes, without\r\ndues, in the port at Tampa Town.  Thence the iron was transported\r\nby rail to Stones Hill, and about the middle of January this\r\nenormous mass of metal was delivered at its destination.\r\n\r\nIt will easily be understood that 1,200 furnaces were not too\r\nmany to melt simultaneously these 60,000 tons of iron.  Each of\r\nthese furnaces contained nearly 140,000 pounds weight of metal.\r\nThey were all built after the model of those which served for\r\nthe casting of the Rodman gun; they were trapezoidal in shape,\r\nwith a high elliptical arch.  These furnaces, constructed of\r\nfireproof brick, were especially adapted for burning pit coal,\r\nwith a flat bottom upon which the iron bars were laid.  This bottom,\r\ninclined at an angle of 25 degrees, allowed the metal to flow into\r\nthe receiving troughs; and the 1,200 converging trenches carried\r\nthe molten metal down to the central well.\r\n\r\nThe day following that on which the works of the masonry and\r\nboring had been completed, Barbicane set to work upon the\r\ncentral mould.  His object now was to raise within the center of\r\nthe well, and with a coincident axis, a cylinder 900 feet high,\r\nand nine feet in diameter, which should exactly fill up the\r\nspace reserved for the bore of the Columbiad.  This cylinder was\r\ncomposed of a mixture of clay and sand, with the addition of a\r\nlittle hay and straw.  The space left between the mould and the\r\nmasonry was intended to be filled up by the molten metal, which\r\nwould thus form the walls six feet in thickness.  This cylinder,\r\nin order to maintain its equilibrium, had to be bound by iron\r\nbands, and firmly fixed at certain intervals by cross-clamps\r\nfastened into the stone lining; after the castings these would\r\nbe buried in the block of metal, leaving no external projection.\r\n\r\nThis operation was completed on the 8th of July, and the run of\r\nthe metal was fixed for the following day.\r\n\r\n\"This _fete_ of the casting will be a grand ceremony,\" said J.\r\nT. Maston to his friend Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said Barbicane; \"but it will not be a public _fete_\"\r\n\r\n\"What! will you not open the gates of the enclosure to all comers?\"\r\n\r\n\"I must be very careful, Maston.  The casting of the Columbiad\r\nis an extremely delicate, not to say a dangerous operation, and\r\nI should prefer its being done privately.  At the discharge of\r\nthe projectile, a _fete_ if you like-- till then, no!\"\r\n\r\nThe president was right.  The operation involved unforeseen\r\ndangers, which a great influx of spectators would have hindered\r\nhim from averting.  It was necessary to preserve complete\r\nfreedom of movement.  No one was admitted within the enclosure\r\nexcept a delegation of members of the Gun Club, who had made the\r\nvoyage to Tampa Town.  Among these was the brisk Bilsby, Tom\r\nHunter, Colonel Blomsberry, Major Elphinstone, General Morgan,\r\nand the rest of the lot to whom the casting of the Columbiad was\r\na matter of personal interest.  J. T. Maston became their cicerone.\r\nHe omitted no point of detail; he conducted them throughout the\r\nmagazines, workshops, through the midst of the engines, and\r\ncompelled them to visit the whole 1,200 furnaces one after\r\nthe other.  At the end of the twelve-hundredth visit they were\r\npretty well knocked up.\r\n\r\nThe casting was to take place at twelve o'clock precisely.\r\nThe previous evening each furnace had been charged with 114,000\r\npounds weight of metal in bars disposed cross-ways to each other,\r\nso as to allow the hot air to circulate freely between them.\r\nAt daybreak the 1,200 chimneys vomited their torrents of flame\r\ninto the air, and the ground was agitated with dull tremblings.\r\nAs many pounds of metal as there were to cast, so many pounds of\r\ncoal were there to burn.  Thus there were 68,000 tons of coal\r\nwhich projected in the face of the sun a thick curtain of smoke.\r\nThe heat soon became insupportable within the circle of furnaces,\r\nthe rumbling of which resembled the rolling of thunder.  The powerful\r\nventilators added their continuous blasts and saturated with\r\noxygen the glowing plates.  The operation, to be successful,\r\nrequired to be conducted with great rapidity.  On a signal given\r\nby a cannon-shot each furnace was to give vent to the molten\r\niron and completely to empty itself.  These arrangements made,\r\nforemen and workmen waited the preconcerted moment with an\r\nimpatience mingled with a certain amount of emotion.  Not a soul\r\nremained within the enclosure.  Each superintendent took his\r\npost by the aperture of the run.\r\n\r\nBarbicane and his colleagues, perched on a neighboring eminence,\r\nassisted at the operation.  In front of them was a piece of\r\nartillery ready to give fire on the signal from the engineer.\r\nSome minutes before midday the first driblets of metal began to\r\nflow; the reservoirs filled little by little; and, by the time\r\nthat the whole melting was completely accomplished, it was kept\r\nin abeyance for a few minutes in order to facilitate the\r\nseparation of foreign substances.\r\n\r\nTwelve o'clock struck!  A gunshot suddenly pealed forth and shot\r\nits flame into the air.  Twelve hundred melting-troughs were\r\nsimultaneously opened and twelve hundred fiery serpents crept\r\ntoward the central well, unrolling their incandescent curves.\r\nThere, down they plunged with a terrific noise into a depth of\r\n900 feet.  It was an exciting and a magnificent spectacle.\r\nThe ground trembled, while these molten waves, launching into the\r\nsky their wreaths of smoke, evaporated the moisture of the mould\r\nand hurled it upward through the vent-holes of the stone lining\r\nin the form of dense vapor-clouds.  These artificial clouds\r\nunrolled their thick spirals to a height of 1,000 yards into\r\nthe air.  A savage, wandering somewhere beyond the limits of the\r\nhorizon, might have believed that some new crater was forming in\r\nthe bosom of Florida, although there was neither any eruption,\r\nnor typhoon, nor storm, nor struggle of the elements, nor any of\r\nthose terrible phenomena which nature is capable of producing.\r\nNo, it was man alone who had produced these reddish vapors,\r\nthese gigantic flames worthy of a volcano itself, these\r\ntremendous vibrations resembling the shock of an earthquake,\r\nthese reverberations rivaling those of hurricanes and storms;\r\nand it was his hand which precipitated into an abyss, dug by\r\nhimself, a whole Niagara of molten metal!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLUMBIAD\r\n\r\n\r\nHad the casting succeeded?  They were reduced to mere conjecture.\r\nThere was indeed every reason to expect success, since the mould\r\nhas absorbed the entire mass of the molten metal; still some\r\nconsiderable time must elapse before they could arrive at any\r\ncertainty upon the matter.\r\n\r\nThe patience of the members of the Gun Club was sorely tried during\r\nthis period of time.  But they could do nothing.  J. T. Maston\r\nescaped roasting by a miracle.  Fifteen days after the casting\r\nan immense column of smoke was still rising in the open sky and\r\nthe ground burned the soles of the feet within a radius of two\r\nhundred feet round the summit of Stones Hill.  It was impossible\r\nto approach nearer.  All they could do was to wait with what\r\npatience they might.\r\n\r\n\"Here we are at the 10th of August,\" exclaimed J. T. Maston one\r\nmorning, \"only four months to the 1st of December!  We shall\r\nnever be ready in time!\"  Barbicane said nothing, but his\r\nsilence covered serious irritation.\r\n\r\nHowever, daily observations revealed a certain change going on\r\nin the state of the ground.  About the 15th of August the vapors\r\nejected had sensibly diminished in intensity and thickness.\r\nSome days afterward the earth exhaled only a slight puff of\r\nsmoke, the last breath of the monster enclosed within its circle\r\nof stone.  Little by little the belt of heat contracted, until\r\non the 22nd of August, Barbicane, his colleagues, and the\r\nengineer were enabled to set foot on the iron sheet which lay\r\nlevel upon the summit of Stones Hill.\r\n\r\n\"At last!\" exclaimed the president of the Gun Club, with an\r\nimmense sigh of relief.\r\n\r\nThe work was resumed the same day.  They proceeded at once to\r\nextract the interior mould, for the purpose of clearing out the\r\nboring of the piece.  Pickaxes and boring irons were set to work\r\nwithout intermission.  The clayey and sandy soils had acquired\r\nextreme hardness under the action of the heat; but, by the aid\r\nof the machines, the rubbish on being dug out was rapidly carted\r\naway on railway wagons; and such was the ardor of the work, so\r\npersuasive the arguments of Barbicane's dollars, that by the 3rd\r\nof September all traces of the mould had entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nImmediately the operation of boring was commenced; and by the\r\naid of powerful machines, a few weeks later, the inner surface\r\nof the immense tube had been rendered perfectly cylindrical, and\r\nthe bore of the piece had acquired a thorough polish.\r\n\r\nAt length, on the 22d of September, less than a twelvemonth\r\nafter Barbicane's original proposition, the enormous weapon,\r\naccurately bored, and exactly vertically pointed, was ready\r\nfor work.  There was only the moon now to wait for; and they\r\nwere pretty sure that she would not fail in the rendezvous.\r\n\r\nThe ecstasy of J. T. Maston knew no bounds, and he narrowly\r\nescaped a frightful fall while staring down the tube.  But for\r\nthe strong hand of Colonel Blomsberry, the worthy secretary,\r\nlike a modern Erostratus, would have found his death in the\r\ndepths of the Columbiad.\r\n\r\nThe cannon was then finished; there was no possible doubt as to\r\nits perfect completion.  So, on the 6th of October, Captain\r\nNicholl opened an account between himself and President Barbicane,\r\nin which he debited himself to the latter in the sum of two\r\nthousand dollars.  One may believe that the captain's wrath was\r\nincreased to its highest point, and must have made him seriously ill.\r\nHowever, he had still three bets of three, four, and five\r\nthousand dollars, respectively; and if he gained two out of these,\r\nhis position would not be very bad.  But the money question did\r\nnot enter into his calculations; it was the success of his rival\r\nin casting a cannon against which iron plates sixty feet thick\r\nwould have been ineffectual, that dealt him a terrible blow.\r\n\r\nAfter the 23rd of September the enclosure of Stones hill was\r\nthrown open to the public; and it will be easily imagined what\r\nwas the concourse of visitors to this spot!  There was an\r\nincessant flow of people to and from Tampa Town and the place,\r\nwhich resembled a procession, or rather, in fact, a pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nIt was already clear to be seen that, on the day of the\r\nexperiment itself, the aggregate of spectators would be counted\r\nby millions; for they were already arriving from all parts of\r\nthe earth upon this narrow strip of promontory.  Europe was\r\nemigrating to America.\r\n\r\nUp to that time, however, it must be confessed, the curiosity\r\nof the numerous comers was but scantily gratified.  Most had\r\ncounted upon witnessing the spectacle of the casting, and they\r\nwere treated to nothing but smoke.  This was sorry food for\r\nhungry eyes; but Barbicane would admit no one to that operation.\r\nThen ensued grumbling, discontent, murmurs; they blamed the\r\npresident, taxed him with dictatorial conduct.  His proceedings\r\nwere declared \"un-American.\"  There was very nearly a riot round\r\nStones Hill; but Barbicane remained inflexible.  When, however,\r\nthe Columbiad was entirely finished, this state of closed doors\r\ncould no longer be maintained; besides it would have been bad\r\ntaste, and even imprudence, to affront the public feeling.\r\nBarbicane, therefore, opened the enclosure to all comers; but,\r\ntrue to his practical disposition, he determined to coin money\r\nout of the public curiosity.\r\n\r\nIt was something, indeed, to be enabled to contemplate this\r\nimmense Columbiad; but to descend into its depths, this seemed\r\nto the Americans the _ne plus ultra_ of earthly felicity.\r\nConsequently, there was not one curious spectator who was not\r\nwilling to give himself the treat of visiting the interior of\r\nthis great metallic abyss.  Baskets suspended from steam-cranes\r\npermitted them to satisfy their curiosity.  There was a\r\nperfect mania.  Women, children, old men, all made it a point\r\nof duty to penetrate the mysteries of the colossal gun.\r\nThe fare for the descent was fixed at five dollars per head;\r\nand despite this high charge, during the two months which\r\npreceded the experiment, the influx of visitors enabled the\r\nGun Club to pocket nearly five hundred thousand dollars!\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that the first visitors of the Columbiad\r\nwere the members of the Gun Club.  This privilege was justly\r\nreserved for that illustrious body.  The ceremony took place on\r\nthe 25th of September.  A basket of honor took down the\r\npresident, J. T. Maston, Major Elphinstone, General Morgan,\r\nColonel Blomsberry, and other members of the club, to the number\r\nof ten in all.  How hot it was at the bottom of that long tube\r\nof metal!  They were half suffocated.  But what delight!\r\nWhat ecstasy!  A table had been laid with six covers on the\r\nmassive stone which formed the bottom of the Columbiad, and\r\nlighted by a jet of electric light resembling that of day itself.\r\nNumerous exquisite dishes, which seemed to descend from heaven,\r\nwere placed successively before the guests, and the richest wines\r\nof France flowed in profusion during this splendid repast, served\r\nnine hundred feet beneath the surface of the earth!\r\n\r\nThe festival was animated, not to say somewhat noisy.  Toasts flew\r\nbackward and forward.  They drank to the earth and to her satellite,\r\nto the Gun Club, the Union, the Moon, Diana, Phoebe, Selene, the\r\n\"peaceful courier of the night!\"  All the hurrahs, carried upward\r\nupon the sonorous waves of the immense acoustic tube, arrived with\r\nthe sound of thunder at its mouth; and the multitude ranged round\r\nStones Hill heartily united their shouts with those of the ten\r\nrevelers hidden from view at the bottom of the gigantic Columbiad.\r\n\r\nJ. T. Maston was no longer master of himself.  Whether he\r\nshouted or gesticulated, ate or drank most, would be a difficult\r\nmatter to determine.  At all events, he would not have given his\r\nplace up for an empire, \"not even if the cannon-- loaded,\r\nprimed, and fired at that very moment--were to blow him in\r\npieces into the planetary world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nA TELEGRAPHIC DISPATCH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great works undertaken by the Gun Club had now virtually\r\ncome to an end; and two months still remained before the day for\r\nthe discharge of the shot to the moon.  To the general impatience\r\nthese two months appeared as long as years!  Hitherto the smallest\r\ndetails of the operation had been daily chronicled by the journals,\r\nwhich the public devoured with eager eyes.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment a circumstance, the most unexpected, the\r\nmost extraordinary and incredible, occurred to rouse afresh\r\ntheir panting spirits, and to throw every mind into a state of\r\nthe most violent excitement.\r\n\r\nOne day, the 30th of September, at 3:47 P.M., a telegram,\r\ntransmitted by cable from Valentia (Ireland) to Newfoundland and\r\nthe American Mainland, arrived at the address of President Barbicane.\r\n\r\nThe president tore open the envelope, read the dispatch, and,\r\ndespite his remarkable powers of self-control, his lips turned\r\npale and his eyes grew dim, on reading the twenty words of\r\nthis telegram.\r\n\r\nHere is the text of the dispatch, which figures now in the\r\narchives of the Gun Club:\r\n\r\n                                FRANCE, PARIS,\r\n                                    30 September, 4 A.M.\r\n            Barbicane, Tampa Town, Florida, United States.\r\n\r\nSubstitute for your spherical shell a cylindro-conical projectile.\r\nI shall go inside.  Shall arrive by steamer Atlanta.\r\n                                                   MICHEL ARDAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PASSENGER OF THE ATLANTA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this astounding news, instead of flying through the electric\r\nwires, had simply arrived by post in the ordinary sealed envelope,\r\nBarbicane would not have hesitated a moment.  He would have held\r\nhis tongue about it, both as a measure of prudence, and in order\r\nnot to have to reconsider his plans.  This telegram might be a\r\ncover for some jest, especially as it came from a Frenchman.\r\nWhat human being would ever have conceived the idea of such\r\na journey? and, if such a person really existed, he must be an\r\nidiot, whom one would shut up in a lunatic ward, rather than\r\nwithin the walls of the projectile.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the dispatch, however, speedily became known;\r\nfor the telegraphic officials possessed but little discretion,\r\nand Michel Ardan's proposition ran at once throughout the\r\nseveral States of the Union.  Barbicane, had, therefore, no\r\nfurther motives for keeping silence.  Consequently, he called\r\ntogether such of his colleagues as were at the moment in Tampa\r\nTown, and without any expression of his own opinions simply read\r\nto them the laconic text itself.  It was received with every\r\npossible variety of expressions of doubt, incredulity, and\r\nderision from every one, with the exception of J. T. Maston, who\r\nexclaimed, \"It is a grand idea, however!\"\r\n\r\nWhen Barbicane originally proposed to send a shot to the moon\r\nevery one looked upon the enterprise as simple and practicable\r\nenough-- a mere question of gunnery; but when a person,\r\nprofessing to be a reasonable being, offered to take passage\r\nwithin the projectile, the whole thing became a farce, or, in\r\nplainer language a humbug.\r\n\r\nOne question, however, remained.  Did such a being exist?\r\nThis telegram flashed across the depths of the Atlantic, the\r\ndesignation of the vessel on board which he was to take his\r\npassage, the date assigned for his speedy arrival, all combined\r\nto impart a certain character of reality to the proposal.\r\nThey must get some clearer notion of the matter.  Scattered groups\r\nof inquirers at length condensed themselves into a compact crowd,\r\nwhich made straight for the residence of President Barbicane.\r\nThat worthy individual was keeping quiet with the intention of\r\nwatching events as they arose.  But he had forgotten to take\r\ninto account the public impatience; and it was with no pleasant\r\ncountenance that he watched the population of Tampa Town\r\ngathering under his windows.  The murmurs and vociferations\r\nbelow presently obliged him to appear.  He came forward,\r\ntherefore, and on silence being procured, a citizen put\r\npoint-blank to him the following question:  \"Is the person\r\nmentioned in the telegram, under the name of Michel Ardan, on\r\nhis way here?  Yes or no.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" replied Barbicane, \"I know no more than you do.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must know,\" roared the impatient voices.\r\n\r\n\"Time will show,\" calmly replied the president.\r\n\r\n\"Time has no business to keep a whole country in suspense,\"\r\nreplied the orator.  \"Have you altered the plans of the\r\nprojectile according to the request of the telegram?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet, gentlemen; but you are right! we must have better\r\ninformation to go by.  The telegraph must complete its information.\"\r\n\r\n\"To the telegraph!\" roared the crowd.\r\n\r\nBarbicane descended; and heading the immense assemblage, led the\r\nway to the telegraph office.  A few minutes later a telegram was\r\ndispatched to the secretary of the underwriters at Liverpool,\r\nrequesting answers to the following queries:\r\n\r\n\"About the ship Atlanta-- when did she leave Europe?  Had she on\r\nboard a Frenchman named Michel Ardan?\"\r\n\r\nTwo hours afterward Barbicane received information too exact to\r\nleave room for the smallest remaining doubt.\r\n\r\n\"The steamer Atlanta from Liverpool put to sea on the 2nd of\r\nOctober, bound for Tampa Town, having on board a Frenchman borne\r\non the list of passengers by the name of Michel Ardan.\"\r\n\r\nThat very evening he wrote to the house of Breadwill and Co.,\r\nrequesting them to suspend the casting of the projectile until\r\nthe receipt of further orders.  On the 10th of October, at nine\r\nA.M., the semaphores of the Bahama Canal signaled a thick smoke\r\non the horizon.  Two hours later a large steamer exchanged\r\nsignals with them.  the name of the Atlanta flew at once over\r\nTampa Town.  At four o'clock the English vessel entered the Bay\r\nof Espiritu Santo.  At five it crossed the passage of\r\nHillisborough Bay at full steam.  At six she cast anchor at\r\nPort Tampa.  The anchor had scarcely caught the sandy bottom when\r\nfive hundred boats surrounded the Atlanta, and the steamer was\r\ntaken by assault.  Barbicane was the first to set foot on deck,\r\nand in a voice of which he vainly tried to conceal the emotion,\r\ncalled \"Michel Ardan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here!\" replied an individual perched on the poop.\r\n\r\nBarbicane, with arms crossed, looked fixedly at the passenger of\r\nthe Atlanta.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of about forty-two years of age, of large build,\r\nbut slightly round-shouldered.  His massive head momentarily\r\nshook a shock of reddish hair, which resembled a lion's mane.\r\nHis face was short with a broad forehead, and furnished with a\r\nmoustache as bristly as a cat's, and little patches of yellowish\r\nwhiskers upon full cheeks.  Round, wildish eyes, slightly\r\nnear-sighted, completed a physiognomy essentially feline.\r\nHis nose was firmly shaped, his mouth particularly sweet in\r\nexpression, high forehead, intelligent and furrowed with\r\nwrinkles like a newly-plowed field.  The body was powerfully\r\ndeveloped and firmly fixed upon long legs.  Muscular arms,\r\nand a general air of decision gave him the appearance of a hardy,\r\njolly, companion.  He was dressed in a suit of ample dimensions,\r\nloose neckerchief, open shirtcollar, disclosing a robust neck;\r\nhis cuffs were invariably unbuttoned, through which appeared\r\na pair of red hands.\r\n\r\nOn the bridge of the steamer, in the midst of the crowd, he\r\nbustled to and fro, never still for a moment, \"dragging his\r\nanchors,\" as the sailors say, gesticulating, making free with\r\neverybody, biting his nails with nervous avidity.  He was one of\r\nthose originals which nature sometimes invents in the freak of\r\na moment, and of which she then breaks the mould.\r\n\r\nAmong other peculiarities, this curiosity gave himself out for\r\na sublime ignoramus, \"like Shakespeare,\" and professed supreme\r\ncontempt for all scientific men.  Those \"fellows,\" as he called\r\nthem, \"are only fit to mark the points, while we play the game.\"\r\nHe was, in fact, a thorough Bohemian, adventurous, but not an\r\nadventurer; a hare-brained fellow, a kind of Icarus, only\r\npossessing relays of wings.  For the rest, he was ever in\r\nscrapes, ending invariably by falling on his feet, like those\r\nlittle figures which they sell for children's toys.  In a few\r\nwords, his motto was \"I have my opinions,\" and the love of the\r\nimpossible constituted his ruling passion.\r\n\r\nSuch was the passenger of the Atlanta, always excitable, as if\r\nboiling under the action of some internal fire by the character\r\nof his physical organization.  If ever two individuals offered\r\na striking contrast to each other, these were certainly Michel\r\nArdan and the Yankee Barbicane; both, moreover, being equally\r\nenterprising and daring, each in his own way.\r\n\r\nThe scrutiny which the president of the Gun Club had instituted\r\nregarding this new rival was quickly interrupted by the shouts\r\nand hurrahs of the crowd.  The cries became at last so\r\nuproarious, and the popular enthusiasm assumed so personal a\r\nform, that Michel Ardan, after having shaken hands some\r\nthousands of times, at the imminent risk of leaving his fingers\r\nbehind him, was fain at last to make a bolt for his cabin.\r\n\r\nBarbicane followed him without uttering a word.\r\n\r\n\"You are Barbicane, I suppose?\" said Michel Ardan, in a tone\r\nof voice in which he would have addressed a friend of twenty\r\nyears' standing.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the president of the Gun Club.\r\n\r\n\"All right! how d'ye do, Barbicane? how are you getting on--\r\npretty well? that's right.\"\r\n\r\n\"So,\" said Barbicane without further preliminary, \"you are quite\r\ndetermined to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite decided.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing will stop you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.  Have you modified your projectile according to my telegram.\"\r\n\r\n\"I waited for your arrival.  But,\" asked Barbicane again, \"have\r\nyou carefully reflected?\"\r\n\r\n\"Reflected? have I any time to spare?  I find an opportunity of\r\nmaking a tour in the moon, and I mean to profit by it.  There is\r\nthe whole gist of the matter.\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane looked hard at this man who spoke so lightly of his\r\nproject with such complete absence of anxiety.  \"But, at least,\"\r\nsaid he, \"you have some plans, some means of carrying your\r\nproject into execution?\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent, my dear Barbicane; only permit me to offer one remark:\r\nMy wish is to tell my story once for all, to everybody, and then\r\nhave done with it; then there will be no need for recapitulation.\r\nSo, if you have no objection, assemble your friends, colleagues,\r\nthe whole town, all Florida, all America if you like, and\r\nto-morrow I shall be ready to explain my plans and answer any\r\nobjections whatever that may be advanced.  You may rest assured\r\nI shall wait without stirring.  Will that suit you?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\nSo saying, the president left the cabin and informed the crowd of\r\nthe proposal of Michel Ardan.  His words were received with clappings\r\nof hands and shouts of joy.  They had removed all difficulties.\r\nTo-morrow every one would contemplate at his ease this European hero.\r\nHowever, some of the spectators, more infatuated than the rest,\r\nwould not leave the deck of the Atlanta.  They passed the night\r\non board.  Among others J. T. Maston got his hook fixed in the\r\ncombing of the poop, and it pretty nearly required the capstan to\r\nget it out again.\r\n\r\n\"He is a hero! a hero!\" he cried, a theme of which he was never\r\ntired of ringing the changes; \"and we are only like weak, silly\r\nwomen, compared with this European!\"\r\n\r\nAs to the president, after having suggested to the visitors it\r\nwas time to retire, he re-entered the passenger's cabin, and\r\nremained there till the bell of the steamer made it midnight.\r\n\r\nBut then the two rivals in popularity shook hands heartily and\r\nparted on terms of intimate friendship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nA MONSTER MEETING\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following day Barbicane, fearing that indiscreet\r\nquestions might be put to Michel Ardan, was desirous of reducing\r\nthe number of the audience to a few of the initiated, his own\r\ncolleagues for instance.  He might as well have tried to\r\ncheck the Falls of Niagara! he was compelled, therefore, to\r\ngive up the idea, and let his new friend run the chances of a\r\npublic conference.  The place chosen for this monster meeting\r\nwas a vast plain situated in the rear of the town.  In a few\r\nhours, thanks to the help of the shipping in port, an immense\r\nroofing of canvas was stretched over the parched prairie, and\r\nprotected it from the burning rays of the sun.  There three\r\nhundred thousand people braved for many hours the stifling heat\r\nwhile awaiting the arrival of the Frenchman.  Of this crowd of\r\nspectators a first set could both see and hear; a second set saw\r\nbadly and heard nothing at all; and as for the third, it could\r\nneither see nor hear anything at all.  At three o'clock Michel\r\nArdan made his appearance, accompanied by the principal members\r\nof the Gun Club.  He was supported on his right by President\r\nBarbicane, and on his left by J. T. Maston, more radiant than\r\nthe midday sun, and nearly as ruddy.  Ardan mounted a platform,\r\nfrom the top of which his view extended over a sea of black hats.\r\n\r\nHe exhibited not the slightest embarrassment; he was just as\r\ngay, familiar, and pleasant as if he were at home.  To the\r\nhurrahs which greeted him he replied by a graceful bow; then,\r\nwaving his hands to request silence, he spoke in perfectly\r\ncorrect English as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, despite the very hot weather I request your patience\r\nfor a short time while I offer some explanations regarding the\r\nprojects which seem to have so interested you.  I am neither an\r\norator nor a man of science, and I had no idea of addressing you\r\nin public; but my friend Barbicane has told me that you would\r\nlike to hear me, and I am quite at your service.  Listen to me,\r\ntherefore, with your six hundred thousand ears, and please\r\nexcuse the faults of the speaker.  Now pray do not forget that\r\nyou see before you a perfect ignoramus whose ignorance goes so\r\nfar that he cannot even understand the difficulties!  It seemed\r\nto him that it was a matter quite simple, natural, and easy\r\nto take one's place in a projectile and start for the moon!\r\nThat journey must be undertaken sooner or later; and, as for the\r\nmode of locomotion adopted, it follows simply the law of progress.\r\nMan began by walking on all-fours; then, one fine day, on two\r\nfeet; then in a carriage; then in a stage-coach; and lastly\r\nby railway.  Well, the projectile is the vehicle of the future,\r\nand the planets themselves are nothing else!  Now some of you,\r\ngentlemen, may imagine that the velocity we propose to impart to\r\nit is extravagant.  It is nothing of the kind.  All the stars\r\nexceed it in rapidity, and the earth herself is at this moment\r\ncarrying us round the sun at three times as rapid a rate, and\r\nyet she is a mere lounger on the way compared with many others\r\nof the planets!  And her velocity is constantly decreasing.\r\nIs it not evident, then, I ask you, that there will some day appear\r\nvelocities far greater than these, of which light or electricity\r\nwill probably be the mechanical agent?\r\n\r\n\"Yes, gentlemen,\" continued the orator, \"in spite of the\r\nopinions of certain narrow-minded people, who would shut up the\r\nhuman race upon this globe, as within some magic circle which it\r\nmust never outstep, we shall one day travel to the moon, the\r\nplanets, and the stars, with the same facility, rapidity, and\r\ncertainty as we now make the voyage from Liverpool to New York!\r\nDistance is but a relative expression, and must end by being\r\nreduced to zero.\"\r\n\r\nThe assembly, strongly predisposed as they were in favor of the\r\nFrench hero, were slightly staggered at this bold theory.\r\nMichel Ardan perceived the fact.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" he continued with a pleasant smile, \"you do not\r\nseem quite convinced.  Very good!  Let us reason the matter out.\r\nDo you know how long it would take for an express train to reach\r\nthe moon?  Three hundred days; no more!  And what is that?\r\nThe distance is no more than nine times the circumference of\r\nthe earth; and there are no sailors or travelers, of even\r\nmoderate activity, who have not made longer journeys than that\r\nin their lifetime.  And now consider that I shall be only ninety-\r\nseven hours on my journey.  Ah!  I see you are reckoning that the\r\nmoon is a long way off from the earth, and that one must think\r\ntwice before making the experiment.  What would you say, then,\r\nif we were talking of going to Neptune, which revolves at a\r\ndistance of more than two thousand seven hundred and twenty\r\nmillions of miles from the sun!  And yet what is that compared\r\nwith the distance of the fixed stars, some of which, such as Arcturus,\r\nare billions of miles distant from us?  And then you talk of the\r\ndistance which separates the planets from the sun!  And there\r\nare people who affirm that such a thing as distance exists.\r\nAbsurdity, folly, idiotic nonsense!  Would you know what I think\r\nof our own solar universe?  Shall I tell you my theory?  It is\r\nvery simple!  In my opinion the solar system is a solid\r\nhomogeneous body; the planets which compose it are in actual\r\ncontact with each other; and whatever space exists between them\r\nis nothing more than the space which separates the molecules of\r\nthe densest metal, such as silver, iron, or platinum!  I have\r\nthe right, therefore, to affirm, and I repeat, with the\r\nconviction which must penetrate all your minds, `Distance is\r\nbut an empty name; distance does not really exist!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" cried one voice (need it be said it was that of\r\nJ. T. Maston).  \"Distance does not exist!\"  And overcome by the\r\nenergy of his movements, he nearly fell from the platform to\r\nthe ground.  He just escaped a severe fall, which would have\r\nproved to him that distance was by no means an empty name.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" resumed the orator, \"I repeat that the distance\r\nbetween the earth and her satellite is a mere trifle, and\r\nundeserving of serious consideration.  I am convinced that\r\nbefore twenty years are over one-half of our earth will have\r\npaid a visit to the moon.  Now, my worthy friends, if you have\r\nany question to put to me, you will, I fear, sadly embarrass a\r\npoor man like myself; still I will do my best to answer you.\"\r\n\r\nUp to this point the president of the Gun Club had been\r\nsatisfied with the turn which the discussion had assumed.\r\nIt became now, however, desirable to divert Ardan from\r\nquestions of a practical nature, with which he was doubtless\r\nfar less conversant.  Barbicane, therefore, hastened to get in\r\na word, and began by asking his new friend whether he thought\r\nthat the moon and the planets were inhabited.\r\n\r\n\"You put before me a great problem, my worthy president,\"\r\nreplied the orator, smiling.  \"Still, men of great intelligence,\r\nsuch as Plutarch, Swedenborg, Bernardin de St. Pierre, and\r\nothers have, if I mistake not, pronounced in the affirmative.\r\nLooking at the question from the natural philosopher's point of\r\nview, I should say that nothing useless existed in the world;\r\nand, replying to your question by another, I should venture to\r\nassert, that if these worlds are habitable, they either are,\r\nhave been, or will be inhabited.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one could answer more logically or fairly,\" replied the\r\npresident.  \"The question then reverts to this:  Are these\r\nworlds habitable?  For my own part I believe they are.\"\r\n\r\n\"For myself, I feel certain of it,\" said Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" retorted one of the audience, \"there are many\r\narguments against the habitability of the worlds.  The conditions\r\nof life must evidently be greatly modified upon the majority\r\nof them.  To mention only the planets, we should be either\r\nbroiled alive in some, or frozen to death in others, according\r\nas they are more or less removed from the sun.\"\r\n\r\n\"I regret,\" replied Michel Ardan, \"that I have not the honor of\r\npersonally knowing my contradictor, for I would have attempted\r\nto answer him.  His objection has its merits, I admit; but I\r\nthink we may successfully combat it, as well as all others which\r\naffect the habitability of other worlds.  If I were a natural\r\nphilosopher, I would tell him that if less of caloric were set\r\nin motion upon the planets which are nearest to the sun, and\r\nmore, on the contrary, upon those which are farthest removed\r\nfrom it, this simple fact would alone suffice to equalize the\r\nheat, and to render the temperature of those worlds supportable\r\nby beings organized like ourselves.  If I were a naturalist,\r\nI would tell him that, according to some illustrious men of\r\nscience, nature has furnished us with instances upon the earth\r\nof animals existing under very varying conditions of life;\r\nthat fish respire in a medium fatal to other animals; that\r\namphibious creatures possess a double existence very difficult\r\nof explanation; that certain denizens of the seas maintain life\r\nat enormous depths, and there support a pressure equal to that\r\nof fifty or sixty atmospheres without being crushed; that\r\nseveral aquatic insects, insensible to temperature, are met with\r\nequally among boiling springs and in the frozen plains of the\r\nPolar Sea; in fine, that we cannot help recognizing in nature a\r\ndiversity of means of operation oftentimes incomprehensible, but\r\nnot the less real.  If I were a chemist, I would tell him that\r\nthe aerolites, bodies evidently formed exteriorly of our\r\nterrestrial globe, have, upon analysis, revealed indisputable\r\ntraces of carbon, a substance which owes its origin solely to\r\norganized beings, and which, according to the experiments of\r\nReichenbach, must necessarily itself have been endued with\r\nanimation.  And lastly, were I a theologian, I would tell him\r\nthat the scheme of the Divine Redemption, according to St. Paul,\r\nseems to be applicable, not merely to the earth, but to all the\r\ncelestial worlds.  But, unfortunately, I am neither theologian,\r\nnor chemist, nor naturalist, nor philosopher; therefore, in my\r\nabsolute ignorance of the great laws which govern the universe,\r\nI confine myself to saying in reply, `I do not know whether the\r\nworlds are inhabited or not:  and since I do not know, I am going\r\nto see!'\"\r\n\r\nWhether Michel Ardan's antagonist hazarded any further arguments\r\nor not it is impossible to say, for the uproarious shouts of the\r\ncrowd would not allow any expression of opinion to gain a hearing.\r\nOn silence being restored, the triumphant orator contented himself\r\nwith adding the following remarks:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, you will observe that I have but slightly touched\r\nupon this great question.  There is another altogether different\r\nline of argument in favor of the habitability of the stars,\r\nwhich I omit for the present.  I only desire to call attention\r\nto one point.  To those who maintain that the planets are _not_\r\ninhabited one may reply:  You might be perfectly in the right,\r\nif you could only show that the earth is the best possible\r\nworld, in spite of what Voltaire has said.  She has but _one_\r\nsatellite, while Jupiter, Uranus, Saturn, Neptune have each\r\nseveral, an advantage by no means to be despised.  But that\r\nwhich renders our own globe so uncomfortable is the inclination\r\nof its axis to the plane of its orbit.  Hence the inequality of\r\ndays and nights; hence the disagreeable diversity of the seasons.\r\nOn the surface of our unhappy spheroid we are always either too\r\nhot or too cold; we are frozen in winter, broiled in summer;\r\nit is the planet of rheumatism, coughs, bronchitis; while on the\r\nsurface of Jupiter, for example, where the axis is but slightly\r\ninclined, the inhabitants may enjoy uniform temperatures.\r\nIt possesses zones of perpetual springs, summers, autumns, and\r\nwinters; every Jovian may choose for himself what climate he\r\nlikes, and there spend the whole of his life in security from\r\nall variations of temperature.  You will, I am sure, readily\r\nadmit this superiority of Jupiter over our own planet, to say\r\nnothing of his years, which each equal twelve of ours!\r\nUnder such auspices and such marvelous conditions of existence,\r\nit appears to me that the inhabitants of so fortunate a world\r\nmust be in every respect superior to ourselves.  All we require,\r\nin order to attain such perfection, is the mere trifle of having\r\nan axis of rotation less inclined to the plane of its orbit!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" roared an energetic voice, \"let us unite our efforts,\r\ninvent the necessary machines, and rectify the earth's axis!\"\r\n\r\nA thunder of applause followed this proposal, the author of\r\nwhich was, of course, no other than J. T. Maston.  And, in all\r\nprobability, if the truth must be told, if the Yankees could\r\nonly have found a point of application for it, they would have\r\nconstructed a lever capable of raising the earth and rectifying\r\nits axis.  It was just this deficiency which baffled these\r\ndaring mechanicians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\nATTACK AND RIPOSTE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the excitement had subsided, the following words were\r\nheard uttered in a strong and determined voice:\r\n\r\n\"Now that the speaker has favored us with so much imagination,\r\nwould he be so good as to return to his subject, and give us a\r\nlittle practical view of the question?\"\r\n\r\nAll eyes were directed toward the person who spoke.  He was a\r\nlittle dried-up man, of an active figure, with an American\r\n\"goatee\" beard.  Profiting by the different movements in the crowd,\r\nhe had managed by degrees to gain the front row of spectators.\r\nThere, with arms crossed and stern gaze, he watched the hero of\r\nthe meeting.  After having put his question he remained silent,\r\nand appeared to take no notice of the thousands of looks directed\r\ntoward himself, nor of the murmur of disapprobation excited by\r\nhis words.  Meeting at first with no reply, he repeated his\r\nquestion with marked emphasis, adding, \"We are here to talk about\r\nthe _moon_ and not about the _earth_.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, sir,\" replied Michel Ardan; \"the discussion has\r\nbecome irregular.  We will return to the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said the unknown, \"you pretend that our satellite is inhabited.\r\nVery good, but if Selenites do exist, that race of beings assuredly\r\nmust live without breathing, for-- I warn you for your own sake--\r\nthere is not the smallest particle of air on the surface of the moon.\"\r\n\r\nAt this remark Ardan pushed up his shock of red hair; he saw\r\nthat he was on the point of being involved in a struggle with\r\nthis person upon the very gist of the whole question.  He looked\r\nsternly at him in his turn and said:\r\n\r\n\"Oh! so there is no air in the moon?  And pray, if you are so\r\ngood, who ventures to affirm that?\r\n\r\n\"The men of science.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really?\"\r\n\r\n\"Really.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" replied Michel, \"pleasantry apart, I have a profound\r\nrespect for men of science who do possess science, but a\r\nprofound contempt for men of science who do not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know any who belong to the latter category?\"\r\n\r\n\"Decidedly.  In France there are some who maintain that,\r\nmathematically, a bird cannot possibly fly; and others who\r\ndemonstrate theoretically that fishes were never made to\r\nlive in water.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing to do with persons of that description, and I\r\ncan quote, in support of my statement, names which you cannot\r\nrefuse deference to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, sir, you will sadly embarrass a poor ignorant, who,\r\nbesides, asks nothing better than to learn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then, do you introduce scientific questions if you have\r\nnever studied them?\" asked the unknown somewhat coarsely.\r\n\r\n\"For the reason that `he is always brave who never suspects danger.'\r\nI know nothing, it is true; but it is precisely my very weakness\r\nwhich constitutes my strength.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your weakness amounts to folly,\" retorted the unknown in a passion.\r\n\r\n\"All the better,\" replied our Frenchman, \"if it carries me up to\r\nthe moon.\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane and his colleagues devoured with their eyes the intruder\r\nwho had so boldly placed himself in antagonism to their enterprise.\r\nNobody knew him, and the president, uneasy as to the result of so\r\nfree a discussion, watched his new friend with some anxiety.\r\nThe meeting began to be somewhat fidgety also, for the contest\r\ndirected their attention to the dangers, if not the actual\r\nimpossibilities, of the proposed expedition.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" replied Ardan's antagonist, \"there are many and\r\nincontrovertible reasons which prove the absence of an\r\natmosphere in the moon.  I might say that, _a priori_, if one\r\never did exist, it must have been absorbed by the earth; but I\r\nprefer to bring forward indisputable facts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bring them forward then, sir, as many as you please.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" said the stranger, \"that when any luminous rays\r\ncross a medium such as the air, they are deflected out of the\r\nstraight line; in other words, they undergo refraction.  Well!\r\nWhen stars are occulted by the moon, their rays, on grazing the\r\nedge of her disc, exhibit not the least deviation, nor offer the\r\nslightest indication of refraction.  It follows, therefore, that\r\nthe moon cannot be surrounded by an atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\"In point of fact,\" replied Ardan, \"this is your chief, if not\r\nyour _only_ argument; and a really scientific man might be\r\npuzzled to answer it.  For myself, I will simply say that it is\r\ndefective, because it assumes that the angular diameter of the\r\nmoon has been completely determined, which is not the case.\r\nBut let us proceed.  Tell me, my dear sir, do you admit the\r\nexistence of volcanoes on the moon's surface?\"\r\n\r\n\"Extinct, yes!  In activity, no!\"\r\n\r\n\"These volcanoes, however, were at one time in a state of activity?\"\r\n\r\n\"True, but, as they furnish themselves the oxygen necessary for\r\ncombustion, the mere fact of their eruption does not prove the\r\npresence of an atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Proceed again, then; and let us set aside this class of\r\narguments in order to come to direct observations.  In 1715 the\r\nastronomers Louville and Halley, watching the eclipse of the\r\n3rd of May, remarked some very extraordinary scintillations.\r\nThese jets of light, rapid in nature, and of frequent recurrence,\r\nthey attributed to thunderstorms generated in the lunar atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\n\"In 1715,\" replied the unknown, \"the astronomers Louville and\r\nHalley mistook for lunar phenomena some which were purely\r\nterrestrial, such as meteoric or other bodies which are\r\ngenerated in our own atmosphere.  This was the scientific\r\nexplanation at the time of the facts; and that is my answer now.\"\r\n\r\n\"On again, then,\" replied Ardan; \"Herschel, in 1787, observed a\r\ngreat number of luminous points on the moon's surface, did he not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! but without offering any solution of them.  Herschel himself\r\nnever inferred from them the necessity of a lunar atmosphere.\r\nAnd I may add that Baeer and Maedler, the two great authorities\r\nupon the moon, are quite agreed as to the entire absence of air\r\non its surface.\"\r\n\r\nA movement was here manifest among the assemblage, who appeared\r\nto be growing excited by the arguments of this singular personage.\r\n\r\n\"Let us proceed,\" replied Ardan, with perfect coolness, \"and\r\ncome to one important fact.  A skillful French astronomer, M.\r\nLaussedat, in watching the eclipse of July 18, 1860, probed that\r\nthe horns of the lunar crescent were rounded and truncated.\r\nNow, this appearance could only have been produced by a\r\ndeviation of the solar rays in traversing the atmosphere of\r\nthe moon.  There is no other possible explanation of the facts.\"\r\n\r\n\"But is this established as a fact?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely certain!\"\r\n\r\nA counter-movement here took place in favor of the hero of the\r\nmeeting, whose opponent was now reduced to silence.  Ardan resumed\r\nthe conversation; and without exhibiting any exultation at the\r\nadvantage he had gained, simply said:\r\n\r\n\"You see, then, my dear sir, we must not pronounce with absolute\r\npositiveness against the existence of an atmosphere in the moon.\r\nThat atmosphere is, probably, of extreme rarity; nevertheless at\r\nthe present day science generally admits that it exists.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in the mountains, at all events,\" returned the unknown,\r\nunwilling to give in.\r\n\r\n\"No! but at the bottom of the valleys, and not exceeding a few\r\nhundred feet in height.\"\r\n\r\n\"In any case you will do well to take every precaution, for the\r\nair will be terribly rarified.\"\r\n\r\n\"My good sir, there will always be enough for a solitary\r\nindividual; besides, once arrived up there, I shall do my best\r\nto economize, and not to breathe except on grand occasions!\"\r\n\r\nA tremendous roar of laughter rang in the ears of the mysterious\r\ninterlocutor, who glared fiercely round upon the assembly.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" continued Ardan, with a careless air, \"since we are in\r\naccord regarding the presence of a certain atmosphere, we are\r\nforced to admit the presence of a certain quantity of water.\r\nThis is a happy consequence for me.  Moreover, my amiable\r\ncontradictor, permit me to submit to you one further observation.\r\nWe only know _one_ side of the moon's disc; and if there is but\r\nlittle air on the face presented to us, it is possible that there\r\nis plenty on the one turned away from us.\"\r\n\r\n\"And for what reason?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the moon, under the action of the earth's attraction,\r\nhas assumed the form of an egg, which we look at from the\r\nsmaller end.  Hence it follows, by Hausen's calculations, that\r\nits center of gravity is situated in the other hemisphere.\r\nHence it results that the great mass of air and water must have\r\nbeen drawn away to the other face of our satellite during the\r\nfirst days of its creation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pure fancies!\" cried the unknown.\r\n\r\n\"No!  Pure theories! which are based upon the laws of mechanics,\r\nand it seems difficult to me to refute them.  I appeal then to\r\nthis meeting, and I put it to them whether life, such as exists\r\nupon the earth, is possible on the surface of the moon?\"\r\n\r\nThree hundred thousand auditors at once applauded the proposition.\r\nArdan's opponent tried to get in another word, but he could not\r\nobtain a hearing.  Cries and menaces fell upon him like hail.\r\n\r\n\"Enough! enough!\" cried some.\r\n\r\n\"Drive the intruder off!\" shouted others.\r\n\r\n\"Turn him out!\" roared the exasperated crowd.\r\n\r\nBut he, holding firmly on to the platform, did not budge an\r\ninch, and let the storm pass on, which would soon have assumed\r\nformidable proportions, if Michel Ardan had not quieted it by\r\na gesture.  He was too chivalrous to abandon his opponent in an\r\napparent extremity.\r\n\r\n\"You wished to say a few more words?\" he asked, in a pleasant voice.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a thousand; or rather, no, only one!  If you persevere in\r\nyour enterprise, you must be a----\"\r\n\r\n\"Very rash person!  How can you treat me as such? me, who have\r\ndemanded a cylindro-conical projectile, in order to prevent\r\nturning round and round on my way like a squirrel?\"\r\n\r\n\"But, unhappy man, the dreadful recoil will smash you to pieces\r\nat your starting.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear contradictor, you have just put your finger upon the\r\ntrue and only difficulty; nevertheless, I have too good an\r\nopinion of the industrial genius of the Americans not to believe\r\nthat they will succeed in overcoming it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the heat developed by the rapidity of the projectile in\r\ncrossing the strata of air?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! the walls are thick, and I shall soon have crossed\r\nthe atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\n\"But victuals and water?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have calculated for a twelvemonth's supply, and I shall be\r\nonly four days on the journey.\"\r\n\r\n\"But for air to breathe on the road?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall make it by a chemical process.\"\r\n\r\n\"But your fall on the moon, supposing you ever reach it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be six times less dangerous than a sudden fall upon the\r\nearth, because the weight will be only one-sixth as great on the\r\nsurface of the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still it will be enough to smash you like glass!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is to prevent my retarding the shock by means of rockets\r\nconveniently placed, and lighted at the right moment?\"\r\n\r\n\"But after all, supposing all difficulties surmounted, all\r\nobstacles removed, supposing everything combined to favor you,\r\nand granting that you may arrive safe and sound in the moon, how\r\nwill you come back?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not coming back!\"\r\n\r\nAt this reply, almost sublime in its very simplicity, the\r\nassembly became silent.  But its silence was more eloquent than\r\ncould have been its cries of enthusiasm.  The unknown profited\r\nby the opportunity and once more protested:\r\n\r\n\"You will inevitably kill yourself!\" he cried; \"and your death\r\nwill be that of a madman, useless even to science!\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on, my dear unknown, for truly your prophecies are most agreeable!\"\r\n\r\n\"It really is too much!\" cried Michel Ardan's adversary.  \"I do\r\nnot know why I should continue so frivolous a discussion!\r\nPlease yourself about this insane expedition!  We need not\r\ntrouble ourselves about you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray don't stand upon ceremony!\"\r\n\r\n\"No! another person is responsible for your act.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who, may I ask?\" demanded Michel Ardan in an imperious tone.\r\n\r\n\"The ignoramus who organized this equally absurd and\r\nimpossible experiment!\"\r\n\r\nThe attack was direct.  Barbicane, ever since the interference\r\nof the unknown, had been making fearful efforts of self-control;\r\nnow, however, seeing himself directly attacked, he could\r\nrestrain himself no longer.  He rose suddenly, and was rushing\r\nupon the enemy who thus braved him to the face, when all at once\r\nhe found himself separated from him.\r\n\r\nThe platform was lifted by a hundred strong arms, and the president\r\nof the Gun Club shared with Michel Ardan triumphal honors.\r\nThe shield was heavy, but the bearers came in continuous relays,\r\ndisputing, struggling, even fighting among themselves in their\r\neagerness to lend their shoulders to this demonstration.\r\n\r\nHowever, the unknown had not profited by the tumult to quit\r\nhis post.  Besides he could not have done it in the midst of that\r\ncompact crowd.  There he held on in the front row with crossed\r\narms, glaring at President Barbicane.\r\n\r\nThe shouts of the immense crowd continued at their highest pitch\r\nthroughout this triumphant march.  Michel Ardan took it all with\r\nevident pleasure.  His face gleamed with delight.  Several times\r\nthe platform seemed seized with pitching and rolling like a\r\nweatherbeaten ship.  But the two heros of the meeting had good\r\nsea-legs.  They never stumbled; and their vessel arrived without\r\ndues at the port of Tampa Town.\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan managed fortunately to escape from the last\r\nembraces of his vigorous admirers.  He made for the Hotel\r\nFranklin, quickly gained his chamber, and slid under the\r\nbedclothes, while an army of a hundred thousand men kept watch\r\nunder his windows.\r\n\r\nDuring this time a scene, short, grave, and decisive, took place\r\nbetween the mysterious personage and the president of the Gun Club.\r\n\r\nBarbicane, free at last, had gone straight at his adversary.\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" he said shortly.\r\n\r\nThe other followed him on the quay; and the two presently found\r\nthemselves alone at the entrance of an open wharf on Jones' Fall.\r\n\r\nThe two enemies, still mutually unknown, gazed at each other.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Nicholl!\"\r\n\r\n\"So I suspected.  Hitherto chance has never thrown you in my way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am come for that purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have insulted me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Publicly!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you will answer to me for this insult?\"\r\n\r\n\"At this very moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!  I desire that all that passes between us shall be secret.\r\nTheir is a wood situated three miles from Tampa, the wood\r\nof Skersnaw.  Do you know it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you be so good as to enter it to-morrow morning at five\r\no'clock, on one side?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! if you will enter at the other side at the same hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you will not forget your rifle?\" said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"No more than you will forget yours?\" replied Nicholl.\r\n\r\nThese words having been coldly spoken, the president of the Gun\r\nClub and the captain parted.  Barbicane returned to his lodging;\r\nbut instead of snatching a few hours of repose, he passed the\r\nnight in endeavoring to discover a means of evading the recoil\r\nof the projectile, and resolving the difficult problem proposed\r\nby Michel Ardan during the discussion at the meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW A FRENCHMAN MANAGES AN AFFAIR\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the contract of this duel was being discussed by the\r\npresident and the captain-- this dreadful, savage duel, in which\r\neach adversary became a man-hunter-- Michel Ardan was resting\r\nfrom the fatigues of his triumph.  Resting is hardly an\r\nappropriate expression, for American beds rival marble or\r\ngranite tables for hardness.\r\n\r\nArdan was sleeping, then, badly enough, tossing about between\r\nthe cloths which served him for sheets, and he was dreaming of\r\nmaking a more comfortable couch in his projectile when a\r\nfrightful noise disturbed his dreams.  Thundering blows shook\r\nhis door.  They seemed to be caused by some iron instrument.\r\nA great deal of loud talking was distinguishable in this racket,\r\nwhich was rather too early in the morning.  \"Open the door,\"\r\nsome one shrieked, \"for heaven's sake!\"  Ardan saw no reason\r\nfor complying with a demand so roughly expressed.  However, he\r\ngot up and opened the door just as it was giving way before the\r\nblows of this determined visitor.  The secretary of the Gun Club\r\nburst into the room.  A bomb could not have made more noise or\r\nhave entered the room with less ceremony.\r\n\r\n\"Last night,\" cried J. T. Maston, _ex abrupto_, \"our president\r\nwas publicly insulted during the meeting.  He provoked his\r\nadversary, who is none other than Captain Nicholl!  They are\r\nfighting this morning in the wood of Skersnaw.  I heard all the\r\nparticulars from the mouth of Barbicane himself.  If he is\r\nkilled, then our scheme is at an end.  We must prevent his duel;\r\nand one man alone has enough influence over Barbicane to stop\r\nhim, and that man is Michel Ardan.\"\r\n\r\nWhile J. T. Maston was speaking, Michel Ardan, without\r\ninterrupting him, had hastily put on his clothes; and, in less\r\nthan two minutes, the two friends were making for the suburbs of\r\nTampa Town with rapid strides.\r\n\r\nIt was during this walk that Maston told Ardan the state of the\r\ncase.  He told him the real causes of the hostility between\r\nBarbicane and Nicholl; how it was of old date, and why, thanks\r\nto unknown friends, the president and the captain had, as yet,\r\nnever met face to face.  He added that it arose simply from\r\na rivalry between iron plates and shot, and, finally, that the\r\nscene at the meeting was only the long-wished-for opportunity\r\nfor Nicholl to pay off an old grudge.\r\n\r\nNothing is more dreadful than private duels in America.  The two\r\nadversaries attack each other like wild beasts.  Then it is that\r\nthey might well covet those wonderful properties of the Indians\r\nof the prairies-- their quick intelligence, their ingenious\r\ncunning, their scent of the enemy.  A single mistake, a moment's\r\nhesitation, a single false step may cause death.  On these\r\noccasions Yankees are often accompanied by their dogs, and keep\r\nup the struggle for hours.\r\n\r\n\"What demons you are!\" cried Michel Ardan, when his companion\r\nhad depicted this scene to him with much energy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we are,\" replied J. T. modestly; \"but we had better make haste.\"\r\n\r\nThough Michel Ardan and he had crossed the plains still wet with\r\ndew, and had taken the shortest route over creeks and ricefields,\r\nthey could not reach Skersnaw in under five hours and a half.\r\n\r\nBarbicane must have passed the border half an hour ago.\r\n\r\nThere was an old bushman working there, occupied in selling\r\nfagots from trees that had been leveled by his axe.\r\n\r\nMaston ran toward him, saying, \"Have you seen a man go into the\r\nwood, armed with a rifle?  Barbicane, the president, my best friend?\"\r\n\r\nThe worthy secretary of the Gun Club thought that his president\r\nmust be known by all the world.  But the bushman did not seem to\r\nunderstand him.\r\n\r\n\"A hunter?\" said Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"A hunter?  Yes,\" replied the bushman.\r\n\r\n\"Long ago?\"\r\n\r\n\"About an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too late!\" cried Maston.\r\n\r\n\"Have you heard any gunshots?\" asked Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"No!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not one?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not one! that hunter did not look as if he knew how to hunt!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is to be done?\" said Maston.\r\n\r\n\"We must go into the wood, at the risk of getting a ball which\r\nis not intended for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" cried Maston, in a tone which could not be mistaken, \"I would\r\nrather have twenty balls in my own head than one in Barbicane's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forward, then,\" said Ardan, pressing his companion's hand.\r\n\r\nA few moments later the two friends had disappeared in the copse.\r\nIt was a dense thicket, in which rose huge cypresses, sycamores,\r\ntulip-trees, olives, tamarinds, oaks, and magnolias.\r\nThese different trees had interwoven their branches into an\r\ninextricable maze, through which the eye could not penetrate.\r\nMichel Ardan and Maston walked side by side in silence through\r\nthe tall grass, cutting themselves a path through the strong\r\ncreepers, casting curious glances on the bushes, and momentarily\r\nexpecting to hear the sound of rifles.  As for the traces which\r\nBarbicane ought to have left of his passage through the wood,\r\nthere was not a vestige of them visible: so they followed the\r\nbarely perceptible paths along which Indians had tracked some\r\nenemy, and which the dense foliage darkly overshadowed.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour spent in vain pursuit the two stopped in\r\nintensified anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"It must be all over,\" said Maston, discouraged.  \"A man like\r\nBarbicane would not dodge with his enemy, or ensnare him, would\r\nnot even maneuver!  He is too open, too brave.  He has gone\r\nstraight ahead, right into the danger, and doubtless far enough\r\nfrom the bushman for the wind to prevent his hearing the report\r\nof the rifles.\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely,\" replied Michel Ardan, \"since we entered the wood\r\nwe should have heard!\"\r\n\r\n\"And what if we came too late?\" cried Maston in tones of despair.\r\n\r\nFor once Ardan had no reply to make, he and Maston resuming\r\ntheir walk in silence.  From time to time, indeed, they raised\r\ngreat shouts, calling alternately Barbicane and Nicholl, neither\r\nof whom, however, answered their cries.  Only the birds,\r\nawakened by the sound, flew past them and disappeared among the\r\nbranches, while some frightened deer fled precipitately before them.\r\n\r\nFor another hour their search was continued.  The greater part\r\nof the wood had been explored.  There was nothing to reveal the\r\npresence of the combatants.  The information of the bushman was\r\nafter all doubtful, and Ardan was about to propose their\r\nabandoning this useless pursuit, when all at once Maston stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" said he, \"there is some one down there!\"\r\n\r\n\"Some one?\" repeated Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; a man!  He seems motionless.  His rifle is not in his hands.\r\nWhat can he be doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"But can you recognize him?\" asked Ardan, whose short sight was\r\nof little use to him in such circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"Yes! yes!  He is turning toward us,\" answered Maston.\r\n\r\n\"And it is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain Nicholl!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nicholl?\" cried Michel Ardan, feeling a terrible pang of grief.\r\n\r\n\"Nicholl unarmed!  He has, then, no longer any fear of his adversary!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us go to him,\" said Michel Ardan, \"and find out the truth.\"\r\n\r\nBut he and his companion had barely taken fifty steps, when they\r\npaused to examine the captain more attentively.  They expected\r\nto find a bloodthirsty man, happy in his revenge.\r\n\r\nOn seeing him, they remained stupefied.\r\n\r\nA net, composed of very fine meshes, hung between two enormous\r\ntulip-trees, and in the midst of this snare, with its wings\r\nentangled, was a poor little bird, uttering pitiful cries, while\r\nit vainly struggled to escape.  The bird-catcher who had laid\r\nthis snare was no human being, but a venomous spider, peculiar\r\nto that country, as large as a pigeon's egg, and armed with\r\nenormous claws.  The hideous creature, instead of rushing on its\r\nprey, had beaten a sudden retreat and taken refuge in the upper\r\nbranches of the tulip-tree, for a formidable enemy menaced\r\nits stronghold.\r\n\r\nHere, then, was Nicholl, his gun on the ground, forgetful\r\nof danger, trying if possible to save the victim from its\r\ncobweb prison.  At last it was accomplished, and the little\r\nbird flew joyfully away and disappeared.\r\n\r\nNicholl lovingly watched its flight, when he heard these words\r\npronounced by a voice full of emotion:\r\n\r\n\"You are indeed a brave man.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned.  Michel Ardan was before him, repeating in a\r\ndifferent tone:\r\n\r\n\"And a kindhearted one!\"\r\n\r\n\"Michel Ardan!\" cried the captain.  \"Why are you here?\"\r\n\r\n\"To press your hand, Nicholl, and to prevent you from either\r\nkilling Barbicane or being killed by him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Barbicane!\" returned the captain.  \"I have been looking for him\r\nfor the last two hours in vain.  Where is he hiding?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nicholl!\" said Michel Ardan, \"this is not courteous! we ought\r\nalways to treat an adversary with respect; rest assureed if\r\nBarbicane is still alive we shall find him all the more easily;\r\nbecause if he has not, like you, been amusing himself with\r\nfreeing oppressed birds, he must be looking for _you_.  When we\r\nhave found him, Michel Ardan tells you this, there will be no\r\nduel between you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Between President Barbicane and myself,\" gravely replied\r\nNicholl, \"there is a rivalry which the death of one of us----\"\r\n\r\n\"Pooh, pooh!\" said Ardan.  \"Brave fellows like you indeed! you\r\nshall not fight!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will fight, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain,\" said J. T. Maston, with much feeling, \"I am a friend\r\nof the president's, his _alter ego_, his second self; if you\r\nreally must kill some one, _shoot me!_ it will do just as well!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" Nicholl replied, seizing his rifle convulsively, \"these\r\njokes----\"\r\n\r\n\"Our friend Maston is not joking,\" replied Ardan.  \"I fully\r\nunderstand his idea of being killed himself in order to save\r\nhis friend.  But neither he nor Barbicane will fall before the balls\r\nof Captain Nicholl.  Indeed I have so attractive a proposal to\r\nmake to the two rivals, that both will be eager to accept it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Nicholl with manifest incredulity.\r\n\r\n\"Patience!\" exclaimed Ardan.  \"I can only reveal it in the\r\npresence of Barbicane.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us go in search of him then!\" cried the captain.\r\n\r\nThe three men started off at once; the captain having discharged\r\nhis rifle threw it over his shoulder, and advanced in silence.\r\nAnother half hour passed, and the pursuit was still fruitless.\r\nMaston was oppressed by sinister forebodings.  He looked fiercely\r\nat Nicholl, asking himself whether the captain's vengeance had\r\nalready been satisfied, and the unfortunate Barbicane, shot, was\r\nperhaps lying dead on some bloody track.  The same thought seemed\r\nto occur to Ardan; and both were casting inquiring glances on\r\nNicholl, when suddenly Maston paused.\r\n\r\nThe motionless figure of a man leaning against a gigantic\r\ncatalpa twenty feet off appeared, half-veiled by the foliage.\r\n\r\n\"It is he!\" said Maston.\r\n\r\nBarbicane never moved.  Ardan looked at the captain, but he did\r\nnot wince.  Ardan went forward crying:\r\n\r\n\"Barbicane!  Barbicane!\"\r\n\r\nNo answer!  Ardan rushed toward his friend; but in the act of\r\nseizing his arms, he stopped short and uttered a cry of surprise.\r\n\r\nBarbicane, pencil in hand, was tracing geometrical figures in a\r\nmemorandum book, while his unloaded rifle lay beside him on the ground.\r\n\r\nAbsorbed in his studies, Barbicane, in his turn forgetful of the\r\nduel, had seen and heard nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen Ardan took his hand, he looked up and stared at his visitor\r\nin astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, it is you!\" he cried at last.  \"I have found it, my friend,\r\nI have found it!\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"My plan!\"\r\n\r\n\"What plan?\"\r\n\r\n\"The plan for countering the effect of the shock at the\r\ndeparture of the projectile!\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed?\" said Michel Ardan, looking at the captain out of the\r\ncorner of his eye.\r\n\r\n\"Yes! water! simply water, which will act as a spring-- ah!\r\nMaston,\" cried Barbicane, \"you here also?\"\r\n\r\n\"Himself,\" replied Ardan; \"and permit me to introduce to you at\r\nthe same time the worthy Captain Nicholl!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nicholl!\" cried Barbicane, who jumped up at once.  \"Pardon me,\r\ncaptain, I had quite forgotten-- I am ready!\"\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan interfered, without giving the two enemies time to\r\nsay anything more.\r\n\r\n\"Thank heaven!\" said he.  \"It is a happy thing that brave men\r\nlike you two did not meet sooner! we should now have been\r\nmourning for one or other of you.  But, thanks to Providence,\r\nwhich has interfered, there is now no further cause for alarm.\r\nWhen one forgets one's anger in mechanics or in cobwebs, it is\r\na sign that the anger is not dangerous.\"\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan then told the president how the captain had been\r\nfound occupied.\r\n\r\n\"I put it to you now,\" said he in conclusion, \"are two such good\r\nfellows as you are made on purpose to smash each other's skulls\r\nwith shot?\"\r\n\r\nThere was in \"the situation\" somewhat of the ridiculous,\r\nsomething quite unexpected; Michel Ardan saw this, and\r\ndetermined to effect a reconciliation.\r\n\r\n\"My good friends,\" said he, with his most bewitching smile,\r\n\"this is nothing but a misunderstanding.  Nothing more! well! to\r\nprove that it is all over between you, accept frankly the\r\nproposal I am going to make to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make it,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Our friend Barbicane believes that his projectile will go\r\nstraight to the moon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, certainly,\" replied the president.\r\n\r\n\"And our friend Nicholl is persuaded it will fall back upon the earth?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am certain of it,\" cried the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" said Ardan.  \"I cannot pretend to make you agree; but I\r\nsuggest this:  Go with me, and so see whether we are stopped on\r\nour journey.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" exclaimed J. T. Maston, stupefied.\r\n\r\nThe two rivals, on this sudden proposal, looked steadily at\r\neach other.  Barbicane waited for the captain's answer.\r\nNicholl watched for the decision of the president.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" said Michel.  \"There is now no fear of the shock!\"\r\n\r\n\"Done!\" cried Barbicane.\r\n\r\nBut quickly as he pronounced the word, he was not before Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah! bravo! hip! hip! hurrah!\" cried Michel, giving a hand\r\nto each of the late adversaries.  \"Now that it is all settled,\r\nmy friends, allow me to treat you after French fashion.  Let us\r\nbe off to breakfast!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nThat same day all America heard of the affair of Captain Nicholl\r\nand President Barbicane, as well as its singular _denouement_.\r\nFrom that day forth, Michel Ardan had not one moment's rest.\r\nDeputations from all corners of the Union harassed him without\r\ncessation or intermission.  He was compelled to receive them\r\nall, whether he would or no.  How many hands he shook, how many\r\npeople he was \"hail-fellow-well-met\" with, it is impossible\r\nto guess!  Such a triumphal result would have intoxicated any\r\nother man; but he managed to keep himself in a state of delightful\r\n_semi_-tipsiness.\r\n\r\nAmong the deputations of all kinds which assailed him, that of\r\n\"The Lunatics\" were careful not to forget what they owed to the\r\nfuture conqueror of the moon.  One day, certain of these poor\r\npeople, so numerous in America, came to call upon him, and\r\nrequested permission to return with him to their native country.\r\n\r\n\"Singular hallucination!\" said he to Barbicane, after having\r\ndismissed the deputation with promises to convey numbers of\r\nmessages to friends in the moon.  \"Do you believe in the\r\ninfluence of the moon upon distempers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Scarcely!\"\r\n\r\n\"No more do I, despite some remarkable recorded facts of history.\r\nFor instance, during an epidemic in 1693, a large number of\r\npersons died at the very moment of an eclipse.  The celebrated\r\nBacon always fainted during an eclipse.  Charles VI relapsed\r\nsix times into madness during the year 1399, sometimes during\r\nthe new, sometimes during the full moon.  Gall observed that\r\ninsane persons underwent an accession of their disorder twice\r\nin every month, at the epochs of new and full moon.  In fact,\r\nnumerous observations made upon fevers, somnambulisms, and other\r\nhuman maladies, seem to prove that the moon does exercise some\r\nmysterious influence upon man.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the how and the wherefore?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I can only give you the answer which Arago borrowed from\r\nPlutarch, which is nineteen centuries old.  `Perhaps the stories\r\nare not true!'\"\r\n\r\nIn the height of his triumph, Michel Ardan had to encounter all\r\nthe annoyances incidental to a man of celebrity.  Managers of\r\nentertainments wanted to exhibit him.  Barnum offered him a\r\nmillion dollars to make a tour of the United States in his show.\r\nAs for his photographs, they were sold of all size, and his\r\nportrait taken in every imaginable posture.  More than half a\r\nmillion copies were disposed of in an incredibly short space of time.\r\n\r\nBut it was not only the men who paid him homage, but the women\r\nas well.  He might have married well a hundred times over, if he\r\nhad been willing to settle in life.  The old maids, in\r\nparticular, of forty years and upward, and dry in proportion,\r\ndevoured his photographs day and night.  They would have married\r\nhim by hundreds, even if he had imposed upon them the condition\r\nof accompanying him into space.  He had, however, no intention\r\nof transplanting a race of Franco-Americans upon the surface of\r\nthe moon.\r\n\r\nHe therefore declined all offers.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he could withdraw from these somewhat embarrassing\r\ndemonstrations, he went, accompanied by his friends, to pay a\r\nvisit to the Columbiad.  He was highly gratified by his\r\ninspection, and made the descent to the bottom of the tube of\r\nthis gigantic machine which was presently to launch him to the\r\nregions of the moon.  It is necessary here to mention a proposal\r\nof J. T. Maston's.  When the secretary of the Gun Club found\r\nthat Barbicane and Nicholl accepted the proposal of Michel\r\nArdan, he determined to join them, and make one of a smug party\r\nof four.  So one day he determined to be admitted as one of the\r\ntravelers.  Barbicane, pained at having to refuse him, gave him\r\nclearly to understand that the projectile could not possibly\r\ncontain so many passengers.  Maston, in despair, went in search\r\nof Michel Ardan, who counseled him to resign himself to the\r\nsituation, adding one or two arguments _ad hominem_.\r\n\r\n\"You see, old fellow,\" he said, \"you must not take what I say in\r\nbad part; but really, between ourselves, you are in too\r\nincomplete a condition to appear in the moon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Incomplete?\" shrieked the valiant invalid.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dear fellow! imagine our meeting some of the\r\ninhabitants up there!  Would you like to give them such a\r\nmelancholy notion of what goes on down here? to teach them what\r\nwar is, to inform them that we employ our time chiefly in\r\ndevouring each other, in smashing arms and legs, and that too\r\non a globe which is capable of supporting a hundred billions\r\nof inhabitants, and which actually does contain nearly two\r\nhundred millions?  Why, my worthy friend, we should have to\r\nturn you out of doors!\"\r\n\r\n\"But still, if you arrive there in pieces, you will be as\r\nincomplete as I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unquestionably,\" replied Michel Ardan; \"but we shall not.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, a preparatory experiment, tried on the 18th of October,\r\nhad yielded the best results and caused the most well-grounded\r\nhopes of success.  Barbicane, desirous of obtaining some notion\r\nof the effect of the shock at the moment of the projectile's\r\ndeparture, had procured a 38-inch mortar from the arsenal\r\nof Pensacola.  He had this placed on the bank of Hillisborough\r\nRoads, in order that the shell might fall back into the sea, and\r\nthe shock be thereby destroyed.  His object was to ascertain the\r\nextent of the shock of departure, and not that of the return.\r\n\r\nA hollow projectile had been prepared for this curious experiment.\r\nA thick padding fastened upon a kind of elastic network, made of\r\nthe best steel, lined the inside of the walls.  It was a veritable\r\n_nest_ most carefully wadded.\r\n\r\n\"What a pity I can't find room in there,\" said J. T. Maston,\r\nregretting that his height did not allow of his trying the adventure.\r\n\r\nWithin this shell were shut up a large cat, and a squirrel\r\nbelonging to J. T. Maston, and of which he was particularly fond.\r\nThey were desirous, however, of ascertaining how this little\r\nanimal, least of all others subject to giddiness, would endure\r\nthis experimental voyage.\r\n\r\nThe mortar was charged with 160 pounds of powder, and the shell\r\nplaced in the chamber.  On being fired, the projectile rose with\r\ngreat velocity, described a majestic parabola, attained a height\r\nof about a thousand feet, and with a graceful curve descended in\r\nthe midst of the vessels that lay there at anchor.\r\n\r\nWithout a moment's loss of time a small boat put off in the\r\ndirection of its fall; some divers plunged into the water\r\nand attached ropes to the handles of the shell, which was\r\nquickly dragged on board.  Five minutes did not elapse between\r\nthe moment of enclosing the animals and that of unscrewing the\r\ncoverlid of their prison.\r\n\r\nArdan, Barbicane, Maston, and Nicholl were present on board the\r\nboat, and assisted at the operation with an interest which may\r\nreadily be comprehended.  Hardly had the shell been opened when\r\nthe cat leaped out, slightly bruised, but full of life, and\r\nexhibiting no signs whatever of having made an aerial expedition.\r\nNo trace, however, of the squirrel could be discovered.  The truth\r\nat last became apparent-- the cat had eaten its fellow-traveler!\r\n\r\nJ. T. Maston grieved much for the loss of his poor squirrel, and\r\nproposed to add its case to that of other martyrs to science.\r\n\r\nAfter this experiment all hesitation, all fear disappeared.\r\nBesides, Barbicane's plans would ensure greater perfection for\r\nhis projectile, and go far to annihilate altogether the effects\r\nof the shock.  Nothing now remained but to go!\r\n\r\nTwo days later Michel Ardan received a message from the\r\nPresident of the United States, an honor of which he showed\r\nhimself especially sensible.\r\n\r\nAfter the example of his illustrious fellow-countryman, the\r\nMarquis de la Fayette, the government had decreed to him the\r\ntitle of \"Citizen of the United States of America.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROJECTILE-VEHICLE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the completion of the Columbiad the public interest centered\r\nin the projectile itself, the vehicle which was destined to\r\ncarry the three hardy adventurers into space.\r\n\r\nThe new plans had been sent to Breadwill and Co., of Albany,\r\nwith the request for their speedy execution.  The projectile was\r\nconsequently cast on the 2nd of November, and immediately\r\nforwarded by the Eastern Railway to Stones Hill, which it\r\nreached without accident on the 10th of that month, where Michel\r\nArdan, Barbicane, and Nicholl were waiting impatiently for it.\r\n\r\nThe projectile had now to be filled to the depth of three feet\r\nwith a bed of water, intended to support a water-tight wooden\r\ndisc, which worked easily within the walls of the projectile.\r\nIt was upon this kind of raft that the travelers were to take\r\ntheir place.  This body of water was divided by horizontal\r\npartitions, which the shock of the departure would have to break\r\nin succession.  Then each sheet of the water, from the lowest\r\nto the highest, running off into escape tubes toward the top of\r\nthe projectile, constituted a kind of spring; and the wooden\r\ndisc, supplied with extremely powerful plugs, could not strike\r\nthe lowest plate except after breaking successively the\r\ndifferent partitions.  Undoubtedly the travelers would still\r\nhave to encounter a violent recoil after the complete escapement\r\nof the water; but the first shock would be almost entirely\r\ndestroyed by this powerful spring.  The upper parts of the walls\r\nwere lined with a thick padding of leather, fastened upon springs\r\nof the best steel, behind which the escape tubes were completely\r\nconcealed; thus all imaginable precautions had been taken for\r\naverting the first shock; and if they did get crushed, they\r\nmust, as Michel Ardan said, be made of very bad materials.\r\n\r\nThe entrance into this metallic tower was by a narrow aperture\r\ncontrived in the wall of the cone.  This was hermetically closed\r\nby a plate of aluminum, fastened internally by powerful\r\nscrew-pressure.  The travelers could therefore quit their prison\r\nat pleasure, as soon as they should reach the moon.\r\n\r\nLight and view were given by means of four thick lenticular\r\nglass scuttles, two pierced in the circular wall itself, the\r\nthird in the bottom, the fourth in the top.  These scuttles then\r\nwere protected against the shock of departure by plates let into\r\nsolid grooves, which could easily be opened outward by\r\nunscrewing them from the inside.  Reservoirs firmly fixed\r\ncontained water and the necessary provisions; and fire\r\nand light were procurable by means of gas, contained in a\r\nspecial reservoir under a pressure of several atmospheres.\r\nThey had only to turn a tap, and for six hours the gas would\r\nlight and warm this comfortable vehicle.\r\n\r\nThere now remained only the question of air; for allowing for\r\nthe consumption of air by Barbicane, his two companions, and two\r\ndogs which he proposed taking with him, it was necessary to\r\nrenew the air of the projectile.  Now air consists principally\r\nof twenty-one parts of oxygen and seventy-nine of nitrogen.\r\nThe lungs absorb the oxygen, which is indispensable for the support\r\nof life, and reject the nitrogen.  The air expired loses nearly\r\nfive per cent. of the former and contains nearly an equal volume\r\nof carbonic acid, produced by the combustion of the elements of\r\nthe blood.  In an air-tight enclosure, then, after a certain\r\ntime, all the oxygen of the air will be replaced by the carbonic\r\nacid-- a gas fatal to life.  There were two things to be done\r\nthen-- first, to replace the absorbed oxygen; secondly, to\r\ndestroy the expired carbonic acid; both easy enough to do, by\r\nmeans of chlorate of potassium and caustic potash.  The former\r\nis a salt which appears under the form of white crystals; when\r\nraised to a temperature of 400 degrees it is transformed into\r\nchlorure of potassium, and the oxygen which it contains is\r\nentirely liberated.  Now twenty-eight pounds of chlorate of\r\npotassium produces seven pounds of oxygen, or 2,400 litres-- the\r\nquantity necessary for the travelers during twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nCaustic potash has a great affinity for carbonic acid; and it is\r\nsufficient to shake it in order for it to seize upon the acid\r\nand form bicarbonate of potassium.  By these two means they\r\nwould be enabled to restore to the vitiated air its life-\r\nsupporting properties.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, however, to add that the experiments had\r\nhitherto been made _in anima vili_.  Whatever its scientific\r\naccuracy was, they were at present ignorant how it would answer\r\nwith human beings.  The honor of putting it to the proof was\r\nenergetically claimed by J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\n\"Since I am not to go,\" said the brave artillerist, \"I may at\r\nleast live for a week in the projectile.\"\r\n\r\nIt would have been hard to refuse him; so they consented to\r\nhis wish.  A sufficient quantity of chlorate of potassium and\r\nof caustic potash was placed at his disposal, together with\r\nprovisions for eight days.  And having shaken hands with his\r\nfriends, on the 12th of November, at six o'clock A.M., after\r\nstrictly informing them not to open his prison before the 20th,\r\nat six o'clock P.M., he slid down the projectile, the plate of\r\nwhich was at once hermetically sealed.  What did he do with\r\nhimself during that week?  They could get no information.\r\nThe thickness of the walls of the projectile prevented any\r\nsound reaching from the inside to the outside.  On the 20th\r\nof November, at six P.M. exactly, the plate was opened.\r\nThe friends of J. T. Maston had been all along in a state of\r\nmuch anxiety; but they were promptly reassured on hearing a\r\njolly voice shouting a boisterous hurrah.\r\n\r\nPresently afterward the secretary of the Gun Club appeared at\r\nthe top of the cone in a triumphant attitude.  He had grown fat!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TELESCOPE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of October in the preceding year, after the close of\r\nthe subscription, the president of the Gun Club had credited the\r\nObservatory of Cambridge with the necessary sums for the\r\nconstruction of a gigantic optical instrument.  This instrument\r\nwas designed for the purpose of rendering visible on the surface\r\nof the moon any object exceeding nine feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nAt the period when the Gun Club essayed their great experiment,\r\nsuch instruments had reached a high degree of perfection,\r\nand produced some magnificent results.  Two telescopes in\r\nparticular, at this time, were possessed of remarkable power\r\nand of gigantic dimensions.  The first, constructed by Herschel,\r\nwas thirty-six feet in length, and had an object-glass of four\r\nfeet six inches; it possessed a magnifying power of 6,000.\r\nThe second was raised in Ireland, in Parsonstown Park, and belongs\r\nto Lord Rosse.  The length of this tube is forty-eight feet, and\r\nthe diameter of its object-glass six feet; it magnifies 6,400\r\ntimes, and required an immense erection of brick work and\r\nmasonry for the purpose of working it, its weight being twelve\r\nand a half tons.\r\n\r\nStill, despite these colossal dimensions, the actual\r\nenlargements scarcely exceeded 6,000 times in round numbers;\r\nconsequently, the moon was brought within no nearer an apparent\r\ndistance than thirty-nine miles; and objects of less than sixty\r\nfeet in diameter, unless they were of very considerable length,\r\nwere still imperceptible.\r\n\r\nIn the present case, dealing with a projectile nine feet in\r\ndiameter and fifteen feet long, it became necessary to bring the\r\nmoon within an apparent distance of five miles at most; and for\r\nthat purpose to establish a magnifying power of 48,000 times.\r\n\r\nSuch was the question proposed to the Observatory of Cambridge,\r\nThere was no lack of funds; the difficulty was purely one\r\nof construction.\r\n\r\nAfter considerable discussion as to the best form and principle\r\nof the proposed instrument the work was finally commenced.\r\nAccording to the calculations of the Observatory of Cambridge,\r\nthe tube of the new reflector would require to be 280 feet in\r\nlength, and the object-glass sixteen feet in diameter.\r\nColossal as these dimensions may appear, they were diminutive\r\nin comparison with the 10,000 foot telescope proposed by the\r\nastronomer Hooke only a few years ago!\r\n\r\nRegarding the choice of locality, that matter was\r\npromptly determined.  The object was to select some lofty\r\nmountain, and there are not many of these in the United States.\r\nIn fact there are but two chains of moderate elevation, between\r\nwhich runs the magnificent Mississippi, the \"king of rivers\"\r\nas these Republican Yankees delight to call it.\r\n\r\nEastwards rise the Appalachians, the very highest point of\r\nwhich, in New Hampshire, does not exceed the very moderate\r\naltitude of 5,600 feet.\r\n\r\nOn the west, however, rise the Rocky Mountains, that immense\r\nrange which, commencing at the Straights of Magellan, follows\r\nthe western coast of Southern America under the name of the\r\nAndes or the Cordilleras, until it crosses the Isthmus of\r\nPanama, and runs up the whole of North America to the very\r\nborders of the Polar Sea.  The highest elevation of this range\r\nstill does not exceed 10,700 feet.  With this elevation,\r\nnevertheless, the Gun Club were compelled to be content,\r\ninasmuch as they had determined that both telescope and\r\nColumbiad should be erected within the limits of the Union.\r\nAll the necessary apparatus was consequently sent on to the\r\nsummit of Long's Peak, in the territory of Missouri.\r\n\r\nNeither pen nor language can describe the difficulties of all\r\nkinds which the American engineers had to surmount, of the\r\nprodigies of daring and skill which they accomplished.  They had\r\nto raise enormous stones, massive pieces of wrought iron, heavy\r\ncorner-clamps and huge portions of cylinder, with an\r\nobject-glass weighing nearly 30,000 pounds, above the line of\r\nperpetual snow for more than 10,000 feet in height, after\r\ncrossing desert prairies, impenetrable forests, fearful rapids,\r\nfar from all centers of population, and in the midst of savage\r\nregions, in which every detail of life becomes an almost\r\ninsoluble problem.  And yet, notwithstanding these innumerable\r\nobstacles, American genius triumphed.  In less than a year after\r\nthe commencement of the works, toward the close of September,\r\nthe gigantic reflector rose into the air to a height of 280 feet.\r\nIt was raised by means of an enormous iron crane; an ingenious\r\nmechanism allowed it to be easily worked toward all the points\r\nof the heavens, and to follow the stars from the one horizon to\r\nthe other during their journey through the heavens.\r\n\r\nIt had cost $400,000.  The first time it was directed toward the\r\nmoon the observers evinced both curiosity and anxiety.  What were\r\nthey about to discover in the field of this telescope which\r\nmagnified objects 48,000 times?  Would they perceive peoples,\r\nherds of lunar animals, towns, lakes, seas?  No! there was\r\nnothing which science had not already discovered! and on all the\r\npoints of its disc the volcanic nature of the moon became\r\ndeterminable with the utmost precision.\r\n\r\nBut the telescope of the Rocky Mountains, before doing its duty\r\nto the Gun Club, rendered immense services to astronomy.  Thanks to\r\nits penetrative power, the depths of the heavens were sounded to\r\nthe utmost extent; the apparent diameter of a great number of stars\r\nwas accurately measured; and Mr. Clark, of the Cambridge staff,\r\nresolved the Crab nebula in Taurus, which the reflector of Lord\r\nRosse had never been able to decompose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n\r\nFINAL DETAILS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the 22nd of November; the departure was to take place in\r\nten days.  One operation alone remained to be accomplished to\r\nbring all to a happy termination; an operation delicate and\r\nperilous, requiring infinite precautions, and against the\r\nsuccess of which Captain Nicholl had laid his third bet.  It was,\r\nin fact, nothing less than the loading of the Columbiad, and the\r\nintroduction into it of 400,000 pounds of gun-cotton.  Nicholl had\r\nthought, not perhaps without reason, that the handling of such\r\nformidable quantities of pyroxyle would, in all probability,\r\ninvolve a grave catastrophe; and at any rate, that this immense\r\nmass of eminently inflammable matter would inevitably ignite when\r\nsubmitted to the pressure of the projectile.\r\n\r\nThere were indeed dangers accruing as before from the\r\ncarelessness of the Americans, but Barbicane had set his heart\r\non success, and took all possible precautions.  In the first\r\nplace, he was very careful as to the transportation of the\r\ngun-cotton to Stones Hill.  He had it conveyed in small\r\nquantities, carefully packed in sealed cases.  These were\r\nbrought by rail from Tampa Town to the camp, and from thence\r\nwere taken to the Columbiad by barefooted workmen, who deposited\r\nthem in their places by means of cranes placed at the orifice of\r\nthe cannon.  No steam-engine was permitted to work, and every\r\nfire was extinguished within two miles of the works.\r\n\r\nEven in November they feared to work by day, lest the sun's rays\r\nacting on the gun-cotton might lead to unhappy results.  This led\r\nto their working at night, by light produced in a vacuum by means\r\nof Ruhmkorff's apparatus, which threw an artificial brightness\r\ninto the depths of the Columbiad.  There the cartridges were\r\narranged with the utmost regularity, connected by a metallic thread,\r\ndestined to communicate to them all simultaneously the electric\r\nspark, by which means this mass of gun-cotton was eventually\r\nto be ignited.\r\n\r\nBy the 28th of November eight hundred cartridges had been\r\nplaced in the bottom of the Columbiad.  So far the operation had\r\nbeen successful!  But what confusion, what anxieties, what struggles\r\nwere undergone by President Barbicane!  In vain had he refused\r\nadmission to Stones Hill; every day the inquisitive neighbors\r\nscaled the palisades, some even carrying their imprudence to the\r\npoint of smoking while surrounded by bales of gun-cotton.\r\nBarbicane was in a perpetual state of alarm.  J. T. Maston\r\nseconded him to the best of his ability, by giving vigorous\r\nchase to the intruders, and carefully picking up the still\r\nlighted cigar ends which the Yankees threw about.  A somewhat\r\ndifficult task! seeing that more than 300,000 persons were\r\ngathered round the enclosure.  Michel Ardan had volunteered to\r\nsuperintend the transport of the cartridges to the mouth of the\r\nColumbiad; but the president, having surprised him with an\r\nenormous cigar in his mouth, while he was hunting out the rash\r\nspectators to whom he himself offered so dangerous an example,\r\nsaw that he could not trust this fearless smoker, and was\r\ntherefore obliged to mount a special guard over him.\r\n\r\nAt last, Providence being propitious, this wonderful loading\r\ncame to a happy termination, Captain Nicholl's third bet being\r\nthus lost.  It remained now to introduce the projectile into the\r\nColumbiad, and to place it on its soft bed of gun-cotton.\r\n\r\nBut before doing this, all those things necessary for the\r\njourney had to be carefully arranged in the projectile vehicle.\r\nThese necessaries were numerous; and had Ardan been allowed to\r\nfollow his own wishes, there would have been no space remaining\r\nfor the travelers.  It is impossible to conceive of half the\r\nthings this charming Frenchman wished to convey to the moon.\r\nA veritable stock of useless trifles!  But Barbicane interfered\r\nand refused admission to anything not absolutely needed.\r\nSeveral thermometers, barometers, and telescopes were packed in\r\nthe instrument case.\r\n\r\nThe travelers being desirous of examing the moon carefully\r\nduring their voyage, in order to facilitate their studies,\r\nthey took with them Boeer and Moeller's excellent _Mappa\r\nSelenographica_, a masterpiece of patience and observation,\r\nwhich they hoped would enable them to identify those physical\r\nfeatures in the moon, with which they were acquainted.\r\nThis map reproduced with scrupulous fidelity the smallest\r\ndetails of the lunar surface which faces the earth; the\r\nmountains, valleys, craters, peaks, and ridges were all\r\nrepresented, with their exact dimensions, relative positions,\r\nand names; from the mountains Doerfel and Leibnitz on the\r\neastern side of the disc, to the _Mare frigoris_ of the North Pole.\r\n\r\nThey took also three rifles and three fowling-pieces, and a\r\nlarge quantity of balls, shot, and powder.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot tell whom we shall have to deal with,\" said Michel Ardan.\r\n\"Men or beasts may possibly object to our visit.  It is only wise\r\nto take all precautions.\"\r\n\r\nThese defensive weapons were accompanied by pickaxes, crowbars,\r\nsaws, and other useful implements, not to mention clothing\r\nadapted to every temperature, from that of polar regions to that\r\nof the torrid zone.\r\n\r\nArdan wished to convey a number of animals of different sorts,\r\nnot indeed a pair of every known species, as he could not see\r\nthe necessity of acclimatizing serpents, tigers, alligators, or\r\nany other noxious beasts in the moon.  \"Nevertheless,\" he said\r\nto Barbicane, \"some valuable and useful beasts, bullocks, cows,\r\nhorses, and donkeys, would bear the journey very well, and would\r\nalso be very useful to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say, my dear Ardan,\" replied the president, \"but our\r\nprojectile-vehicle is no Noah's ark, from which it differs both in\r\ndimensions and object.  Let us confine ourselves to possibilities.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a prolonged discussion, it was agreed that the travelers\r\nshould restrict themselves to a sporting-dog belonging to\r\nNicholl, and to a large Newfoundland.  Several packets of seeds\r\nwere also included among the necessaries.  Michel Ardan, indeed,\r\nwas anxious to add some sacks full of earth to sow them in; as\r\nit was, he took a dozen shrubs carefully wrapped up in straw to\r\nplant in the moon.\r\n\r\nThe important question of provisions still remained; it being\r\nnecessary to provide against the possibility of their finding\r\nthe moon absolutely barren.  Barbicane managed so successfully,\r\nthat he supplied them with sufficient rations for a year.\r\nThese consisted of preserved meats and vegetables, reduced by\r\nstrong hydraulic pressure to the smallest possible dimensions.\r\nThey were also supplied with brandy, and took water enough for\r\ntwo months, being confident, from astronomical observations,\r\nthat there was no lack of water on the moon's surface.  As to\r\nprovisions, doubtless the inhabitants of the _earth_ would find\r\nnourishment somewhere in the _moon_.  Ardan never questioned\r\nthis; indeed, had he done so, he would never have undertaken\r\nthe journey.\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" he said one day to his friends, \"we shall not be\r\ncompletely abandoned by our terrestrial friends; they will take\r\ncare not to forget us.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed!\" replied J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing would be simpler,\" replied Ardan; \"the Columbiad will\r\nbe always there.  Well! whenever the moon is in a favorable\r\ncondition as to the zenith, if not to the perigee, that is to\r\nsay about once a year, could you not send us a shell packed\r\nwith provisions, which we might expect on some appointed day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah! hurrah!\" cried J. T. Matson; \"what an ingenious fellow!\r\nwhat a splendid idea!  Indeed, my good friends, we shall not\r\nforget you!\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall reckon upon you!  Then, you see, we shall receive news\r\nregularly from the earth, and we shall indeed be stupid if we\r\nhit upon no plan for communicating with our good friends here!\"\r\n\r\nThese words inspired such confidence, that Michel Ardan carried\r\nall the Gun Club with him in his enthusiasm.  What he said\r\nseemed so simple and so easy, so sure of success, that none\r\ncould be so sordidly attached to this earth as to hesitate to\r\nfollow the three travelers on their lunar expedition.\r\n\r\nAll being ready at last, it remained to place the projectile in\r\nthe Columbiad, an operation abundantly accompanied by dangers\r\nand difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe enormous shell was conveyed to the summit of Stones Hill.\r\nThere, powerful cranes raised it, and held it suspended over the\r\nmouth of the cylinder.\r\n\r\nIt was a fearful moment!  What if the chains should break under\r\nits enormous weight?  The sudden fall of such a body would\r\ninevitably cause the gun-cotton to explode!\r\n\r\nFortunately this did not happen; and some hours later the\r\nprojectile-vehicle descended gently into the heart of the cannon\r\nand rested on its couch of pyroxyle, a veritable bed of\r\nexplosive eider-down.  Its pressure had no result, other than\r\nthe more effectual ramming down of the charge in the Columbiad.\r\n\r\n\"I have lost,\" said the captain, who forthwith paid President\r\nBarbicane the sum of three thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nBarbicane did not wish to accept the money from one of his\r\nfellow-travelers, but gave way at last before the determination\r\nof Nicholl, who wished before leaving the earth to fulfill all\r\nhis engagements.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Michel Ardan, \"I have only one thing more to wish\r\nfor you, my brave captain.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"It is that you may lose your two other bets!  Then we shall be\r\nsure not to be stopped on our journey!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRE!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first of December had arrived! the fatal day! for, if the\r\nprojectile were not discharged that very night at 10h. 48m. 40s.\r\nP.M., more than eighteen years must roll by before the moon\r\nwould again present herself under the same conditions of zenith\r\nand perigee.\r\n\r\nThe weather was magnificent.  Despite the approach of winter,\r\nthe sun shone brightly, and bathed in its radiant light that\r\nearth which three of its denizens were about to abandon for a\r\nnew world.\r\n\r\nHow many persons lost their rest on the night which preceded\r\nthis long-expected day!  All hearts beat with disquietude, save\r\nonly the heart of Michel Ardan.  That imperturbable personage\r\ncame and went with his habitual business-like air, while nothing\r\nwhatever denoted that any unusual matter preoccupied his mind.\r\n\r\nAfter dawn, an innumerable multitude covered the prairie which\r\nextends, as far as the eye can reach, round Stones Hill.  Every\r\nquarter of an hour the railway brought fresh accessions of\r\nsightseers; and, according to the statement of the Tampa Town\r\n_Observer_, not less than five millions of spectators thronged\r\nthe soil of Florida.\r\n\r\nFor a whole month previously, the mass of these persons had\r\nbivouacked round the enclosure, and laid the foundations for a\r\ntown which was afterward called \"Ardan's Town.\"  The whole plain\r\nwas covered with huts, cottages, and tents.  Every nation under\r\nthe sun was represented there; and every language might be heard\r\nspoken at the same time.  It was a perfect Babel re-enacted.\r\nAll the various classes of American society were mingled\r\ntogether in terms of absolute equality.  Bankers, farmers,\r\nsailors, cotton-planters, brokers, merchants, watermen,\r\nmagistrates, elbowed each other in the most free-and-easy way.\r\nLouisiana Creoles fraternized with farmers from Indiana;\r\nKentucky and Tennessee gentlemen and haughty Virginians\r\nconversed with trappers and the half-savages of the lakes and\r\nbutchers from Cincinnati.  Broad-brimmed white hats and Panamas,\r\nblue-cotton trousers, light-colored stockings, cambric frills,\r\nwere all here displayed; while upon shirt-fronts, wristbands,\r\nand neckties, upon every finger, even upon the very ears, they\r\nwore an assortment of rings, shirt-pins, brooches, and trinkets,\r\nof which the value only equaled the execrable taste.  Women, children,\r\nand servants, in equally expensive dress, surrounded their husbands,\r\nfathers, or masters, who resembled the patriarchs of tribes in the\r\nmidst of their immense households.\r\n\r\nAt meal-times all fell to work upon the dishes peculiar to the\r\nSouthern States, and consumed with an appetite that threatened\r\nspeedy exhaustion of the victualing powers of Florida,\r\nfricasseed frogs, stuffed monkey, fish chowder, underdone\r\n'possum, and raccoon steaks.  And as for the liquors which\r\naccompanied this indigestible repast!  The shouts, the\r\nvociferations that resounded through the bars and taverns\r\ndecorated with glasses, tankards, and bottles of marvelous\r\nshape, mortars for pounding sugar, and bundles of straws!\r\n\"Mint-julep\" roars one of the barmen; \"Claret sangaree!\"\r\nshouts another; \"Cocktail!\" \"Brandy-smash!\" \"Real mint-julep\r\nin the new style!\"  All these cries intermingled produced a\r\nbewildering and deafening hubbub.\r\n\r\nBut on this day, 1st of December, such sounds were rare.  No one\r\nthought of eating or drinking, and at four P.M. there were vast\r\nnumbers of spectators who had not even taken their customary\r\nlunch!  And, a still more significant fact, even the national\r\npassion for play seemed quelled for the time under the general\r\nexcitement of the hour.\r\n\r\nUp till nightfall, a dull, noiseless agitation, such as\r\nprecedes great catastrophes, ran through the anxious multitude.\r\nAn indescribable uneasiness pervaded all minds, an indefinable\r\nsensation which oppressed the heart.  Every one wished it was over.\r\n\r\nHowever, about seven o'clock, the heavy silence was dissipated.\r\nThe moon rose above the horizon.  Millions of hurrahs hailed\r\nher appearance.  She was punctual to the rendezvous, and shouts\r\nof welcome greeted her on all sides, as her pale beams shone\r\ngracefully in the clear heavens.  At this moment the three\r\nintrepid travelers appeared.  This was the signal for renewed\r\ncries of still greater intensity.  Instantly the vast\r\nassemblage, as with one accord, struck up the national hymn of\r\nthe United States, and \"Yankee Doodle,\" sung by five million of\r\nhearty throats, rose like a roaring tempest to the farthest\r\nlimits of the atmosphere.  Then a profound silence reigned\r\nthroughout the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman and the two Americans had by this time entered the\r\nenclosure reserved in the center of the multitude.  They were\r\naccompanied by the members of the Gun Club, and by deputations\r\nsent from all the European Observatories.  Barbicane, cool and\r\ncollected, was giving his final directions.  Nicholl, with\r\ncompressed lips, his arms crossed behind his back, walked with\r\na firm and measured step.  Michel Ardan, always easy, dressed in\r\nthorough traveler's costume, leathern gaiters on his legs, pouch\r\nby his side, in loose velvet suit, cigar in mouth, was full of\r\ninexhaustible gayety, laughing, joking, playing pranks with J.\r\nT. Maston.  In one word, he was the thorough \"Frenchman\" (and\r\nworse, a \"Parisian\") to the last moment.\r\n\r\nTen o'clock struck!  The moment had arrived for taking their\r\nplaces in the projectile!  The necessary operations for the\r\ndescent, and the subsequent removal of the cranes and\r\nscaffolding that inclined over the mouth of the Columbiad,\r\nrequired a certain period of time.\r\n\r\nBarbicane had regulated his chronometer to the tenth part of a\r\nsecond by that of Murchison the engineer, who was charged with\r\nthe duty of firing the gun by means of an electric spark.\r\nThus the travelers enclosed within the projectile were enabled\r\nto follow with their eyes the impassive needle which marked the\r\nprecise moment of their departure.\r\n\r\nThe moment had arrived for saying \"good-by!\"  The scene was a\r\ntouching one.  Despite his feverish gayety, even Michel Ardan\r\nwas touched.  J. T. Maston had found in his own dry eyes one\r\nancient tear, which he had doubtless reserved for the occasion.\r\nHe dropped it on the forehead of his dear president.\r\n\r\n\"Can I not go?\" he said, \"there is still time!\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible, old fellow!\" replied Barbicane.  A few moments\r\nlater, the three fellow-travelers had ensconced themselves in\r\nthe projectile, and screwed down the plate which covered the\r\nentrance-aperture.  The mouth of the Columbiad, now completely\r\ndisencumbered, was open entirely to the sky.\r\n\r\nThe moon advanced upward in a heaven of the purest clearness,\r\noutshining in her passage the twinkling light of the stars.\r\nShe passed over the constellation of the Twins, and was now\r\nnearing the halfway point between the horizon and the zenith.\r\nA terrible silence weighed upon the entire scene!  Not a breath of\r\nwind upon the earth! not a sound of breathing from the countless\r\nchests of the spectators!  Their hearts seemed afraid to beat!\r\nAll eyes were fixed upon the yawning mouth of the Columbiad.\r\n\r\nMurchison followed with his eye the hand of his chronometer.\r\nIt wanted scarce forty seconds to the moment of departure, but\r\neach second seemed to last an age!  At the twentieth there was\r\na general shudder, as it occurred to the minds of that vast\r\nassemblage that the bold travelers shut up within the projectile\r\nwere also counting those terrible seconds.  Some few cries here\r\nand there escaped the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"Thirty-five!-- thirty-six!-- thirty-seven!-- thirty-eight!--\r\nthirty-nine!-- forty!  FIRE!!!\"\r\n\r\nInstantly Murchison pressed with his finger the key of the\r\nelectric battery, restored the current of the fluid, and\r\ndischarged the spark into the breech of the Columbiad.\r\n\r\nAn appalling unearthly report followed instantly, such as can be\r\ncompared to nothing whatever known, not even to the roar of\r\nthunder, or the blast of volcanic explosions!  No words can\r\nconvey the slightest idea of the terrific sound!  An immense\r\nspout of fire shot up from the bowels of the earth as from a crater.\r\nThe earth heaved up, and with great difficulty some few spectators\r\nobtained a momentary glimpse of the projectile victoriously\r\ncleaving the air in the midst of the fiery vapors!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUL WEATHER\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the moment when that pyramid of fire rose to a prodigious\r\nheight into the air, the glare of flame lit up the whole of\r\nFlorida; and for a moment day superseded night over a\r\nconsiderable extent of the country.  This immense canopy of fire\r\nwas perceived at a distance of one hundred miles out at sea, and\r\nmore than one ship's captain entered in his log the appearance\r\nof this gigantic meteor.\r\n\r\nThe discharge of the Columbiad was accompanied by a\r\nperfect earthquake.  Florida was shaken to its very depths.\r\nThe gases of the powder, expanded by heat, forced back the\r\natmospheric strata with tremendous violence, and this\r\nartificial hurricane rushed like a water-spout through the air.\r\n\r\nNot a single spectator remained on his feet!  Men, women\r\nchildren, all lay prostrate like ears of corn under a tempest.\r\nThere ensued a terrible tumult; a large number of persons were\r\nseriously injured.  J. T. Maston, who, despite all dictates of\r\nprudence, had kept in advance of the mass, was pitched back 120\r\nfeet, shooting like a projectile over the heads of his\r\nfellow-citizens.  Three hundred thousand persons remained deaf\r\nfor a time, and as though struck stupefied.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first effects were over, the injured, the deaf,\r\nand lastly, the crowd in general, woke up with frenzied cries.\r\n\"Hurrah for Ardan!  Hurrah for Barbicane!  Hurrah for Nicholl!\"\r\nrose to the skies.  Thousands of persons, noses in air, armed\r\nwith telescopes and race-glasses, were questioning space,\r\nforgetting all contusions and emotions in the one idea of\r\nwatching for the projectile.  They looked in vain!  It was no\r\nlonger to be seen, and they were obliged to wait for telegrams\r\nfrom Long's Peak.  The director of the Cambridge Observatory was\r\nat his post on the Rocky Mountains; and to him, as a skillful\r\nand persevering astronomer, all observations had been confided.\r\n\r\nBut an unforeseen phenomenon came in to subject the public\r\nimpatience to a severe trial.\r\n\r\nThe weather, hitherto so fine, suddenly changed; the sky became\r\nheavy with clouds.  It could not have been otherwise after the\r\nterrible derangement of the atmospheric strata, and the dispersion\r\nof the enormous quantity of vapor arising from the combustion of\r\n200,000 pounds of pyroxyle!\r\n\r\nOn the morrow the horizon was covered with clouds-- a thick and\r\nimpenetrable curtain between earth and sky, which unhappily\r\nextended as far as the Rocky Mountains.  It was a fatality!\r\nBut since man had chosen so to disturb the atmosphere, he was\r\nbound to accept the consequences of his experiment.\r\n\r\nSupposing, now, that the experiment had succeeded, the travelers\r\nhaving started on the 1st of December, at 10h. 46m. 40s. P.M.,\r\nwere due on the 4th at 0h. P.M. at their destination.  So that\r\nup to that time it would have been very difficult after all to\r\nhave observed, under such conditions, a body so small as the shell.\r\nTherefore they waited with what patience they might.\r\n\r\nFrom the 4th to the 6th of December inclusive, the weather\r\nremaining much the same in America, the great European\r\ninstruments of Herschel, Rosse, and Foucault, were constantly\r\ndirected toward the moon, for the weather was then magnificent;\r\nbut the comparative weakness of their glasses prevented any\r\ntrustworthy observations being made.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th the sky seemed to lighten.  They were in hopes now,\r\nbut their hope was of but short duration, and at night again\r\nthick clouds hid the starry vault from all eyes.\r\n\r\nMatters were now becoming serious, when on the 9th the sun\r\nreappeared for an instant, as if for the purpose of teasing\r\nthe Americans.  It was received with hisses; and wounded, no\r\ndoubt, by such a reception, showed itself very sparing of its rays.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th, no change!  J. T. Maston went nearly mad, and great\r\nfears were entertained regarding the brain of this worthy\r\nindividual, which had hitherto been so well preserved within his\r\ngutta-percha cranium.\r\n\r\nBut on the 11th one of those inexplicable tempests peculiar to\r\nthose intertropical regions was let loose in the atmosphere.\r\nA terrific east wind swept away the groups of clouds which had\r\nbeen so long gathering, and at night the semi-disc of the orb of\r\nnight rode majestically amid the soft constellations of the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW STAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThat very night, the startling news so impatiently awaited,\r\nburst like a thunderbolt over the United States of the Union,\r\nand thence, darting across the ocean, ran through all the\r\ntelegraphic wires of the globe.  The projectile had been\r\ndetected, thanks to the gigantic reflector of Long's Peak!\r\nHere is the note received by the director of the Observatory\r\nof Cambridge.  It contains the scientific conclusion regarding\r\nthis great experiment of the Gun Club.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LONG'S PEAK, December 12.\r\nTo the Officers of the Observatory of Cambridge.\r\nThe projectile discharged by the Columbiad at Stones Hill has\r\nbeen detected by Messrs. Belfast and J. T. Maston, 12th of\r\nDecember, at 8:47 P.M., the moon having entered her last quarter.\r\nThis projectile has not arrived at its destination.  It has\r\npassed by the side; but sufficiently near to be retained by the\r\nlunar attraction.\r\n\r\nThe rectilinear movement has thus become changed into a circular\r\nmotion of extreme velocity, and it is now pursuing an elliptical\r\norbit round the moon, of which it has become a true satellite.\r\n\r\nThe elements of this new star we have as yet been unable to\r\ndetermine; we do not yet know the velocity of its passage.\r\nThe distance which separates it from the surface of the moon\r\nmay be estimated at about 2,833 miles.\r\n\r\nHowever, two hypotheses come here into our consideration.\r\n\r\n1. Either the attraction of the moon will end by drawing them\r\ninto itself, and the travelers will attain their destination; or,\r\n\r\n2. The projectile, following an immutable law, will continue to\r\ngravitate round the moon till the end of time.\r\n\r\nAt some future time, our observations will be able to determine\r\nthis point, but till then the experiment of the Gun Club can\r\nhave no other result than to have provided our solar system with\r\na new star.\r\n                                              J. BELFAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo how many questions did this unexpected _denouement_ give rise?\r\nWhat mysterious results was the future reserving for the\r\ninvestigation of science?  At all events, the names of Nicholl,\r\nBarbicane, and Michel Ardan were certain to be immortalized in\r\nthe annals of astronomy!\r\n\r\nWhen the dispatch from Long's Peak had once become known, there\r\nwas but one universal feeling of surprise and alarm.  Was it\r\npossible to go to the aid of these bold travelers?  No! for they\r\nhad placed themselves beyond the pale of humanity, by crossing\r\nthe limits imposed by the Creator on his earthly creatures.\r\nThey had air enough for _two_ months; they had victuals enough\r\nfor _twelve;-- but after that?_  There was only one man who\r\nwould not admit that the situation was desperate-- he alone had\r\nconfidence; and that was their devoted friend J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\nBesides, he never let them get out of sight.  His home was\r\nhenceforth the post at Long's Peak; his horizon, the mirror of\r\nthat immense reflector.  As soon as the moon rose above the\r\nhorizon, he immediately caught her in the field of the\r\ntelescope; he never let her go for an instant out of his\r\nsight, and followed her assiduously in her course through the\r\nstellar spaces.  He watched with untiring patience the passage\r\nof the projectile across her silvery disc, and really the worthy\r\nman remained in perpetual communication with his three friends,\r\nwhom he did not despair of seeing again some day.\r\n\r\n\"Those three men,\" said he, \"have carried into space all the\r\nresources of art, science, and industry.  With that, one can do\r\nanything; and you will see that, some day, they will come out\r\nall right.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROUND THE MOON\r\n\r\nA SEQUEL TO\r\n\r\nFROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROUND THE MOON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY CHAPTER\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST PART OF THIS WORK, AND SERVING AS A PREFACE TO THE SECOND\r\n\r\nDuring the year 186-, the whole world was greatly excited by a\r\nscientific experiment unprecedented in the annals of science.\r\nThe members of the Gun Club, a circle of artillerymen formed at\r\nBaltimore after the American war, conceived the idea of\r\nputting themselves in communication with the moon!-- yes, with\r\nthe moon-- by sending to her a projectile.  Their president,\r\nBarbicane, the promoter of the enterprise, having consulted the\r\nastronomers of the Cambridge Observatory upon the subject, took\r\nall necessary means to ensure the success of this extraordinary\r\nenterprise, which had been declared practicable by the majority\r\nof competent judges.  After setting on foot a public\r\nsubscription, which realized nearly L1,200,000, they began the\r\ngigantic work.\r\n\r\nAccording to the advice forwarded from the members of the\r\nObservatory, the gun destined to launch the projectile had to be\r\nfixed in a country situated between the 0 and 28th degrees of\r\nnorth or south latitude, in order to aim at the moon when at the\r\nzenith; and its initiatory velocity was fixed at twelve thousand\r\nyards to the second.  Launched on the 1st of December, at 10hrs.\r\n46m. 40s. P.M., it ought to reach the moon four days after its\r\ndeparture, that is on the 5th of December, at midnight\r\nprecisely, at the moment of her attaining her perigee, that is\r\nher nearest distance from the earth, which is exactly 86,410\r\nleagues (French), or 238,833 miles mean distance (English).\r\n\r\nThe principal members of the Gun Club, President Barbicane,\r\nMajor Elphinstone, the secretary Joseph T. Maston, and other\r\nlearned men, held several meetings, at which the shape and\r\ncomposition of the projectile were discussed, also the position\r\nand nature of the gun, and the quality and quantity of powder\r\nto be used.  It was decided:  First, that the projectile should\r\nbe a shell made of aluminum with a diameter of 108 inches and a\r\nthickness of twelve inches to its walls; and should weigh\r\n19,250 pounds.  Second, that the gun should be a Columbiad\r\ncast in iron, 900 feet long, and run perpendicularly into\r\nthe earth.  Third, that the charge should contain 400,000 pounds\r\nof gun-cotton, which, giving out six billions of litres of gas in\r\nrear of the projectile, would easily carry it toward the orb of night.\r\n\r\nThese questions determined President Barbicane, assisted by\r\nMurchison the engineer, to choose a spot situated in Florida, in\r\n27@ 7' North latitude, and 77@ 3' West (Greenwich) longitude.\r\nIt was on this spot, after stupendous labor, that the Columbiad\r\nwas cast with full success.  Things stood thus, when an incident\r\ntook place which increased the interest attached to this great\r\nenterprise a hundredfold.\r\n\r\nA Frenchman, an enthusiastic Parisian, as witty as he was bold,\r\nasked to be enclosed in the projectile, in order that he might\r\nreach the moon, and reconnoiter this terrestrial satellite.\r\nThe name of this intrepid adventurer was Michel Ardan.  He landed\r\nin America, was received with enthusiasm, held meetings, saw\r\nhimself carried in triumph, reconciled President Barbicane to\r\nhis mortal enemy, Captain Nicholl, and, as a token of\r\nreconciliation, persuaded them both to start with him in\r\nthe projectile.  The proposition being accepted, the shape\r\nof the projectile was slightly altered.  It was made of a\r\ncylindro-conical form.  This species of aerial car was lined with\r\nstrong springs and partitions to deaden the shock of departure.\r\nIt was provided with food for a year, water for some months,\r\nand gas for some days.  A self-acting apparatus supplied the\r\nthree travelers with air to breathe.  At the same time, on one\r\nof the highest points of the Rocky Mountains, the Gun Club had\r\na gigantic telescope erected, in order that they might be able\r\nto follow the course of the projectile through space.  All was\r\nthen ready.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of November, at the hour fixed upon, from the midst\r\nof an extraordinary crowd of spectators, the departure took place,\r\nand for the first time, three human beings quitted the terrestrial\r\nglobe, and launched into inter-planetary space with almost a\r\ncertainty of reaching their destination.  These bold travelers,\r\nMichel Ardan, President Barbicane, and Captain Nicholl, ought to\r\nmake the passage in ninety-seven hours, thirteen minutes, and\r\ntwenty seconds.  Consequently, their arrival on the lunar disc\r\ncould not take place until the 5th of December at twelve at night,\r\nat the exact moment when the moon should be full, and not on the\r\n4th, as some badly informed journalists had announced.\r\n\r\nBut an unforeseen circumstance, viz., the detonation produced\r\nby the Columbiad, had the immediate effect of troubling the\r\nterrestrial atmosphere, by accumulating a large quantity of\r\nvapor, a phenomenon which excited universal indignation, for the\r\nmoon was hidden from the eyes of the watchers for several nights.\r\n\r\nThe worthy Joseph T. Maston, the staunchest friend of the three\r\ntravelers, started for the Rocky Mountains, accompanied by the\r\nHon. J. Belfast, director of the Cambridge Observatory, and\r\nreached the station of Long's Peak, where the telescope was\r\nerected which brought the moon within an apparent distance of\r\ntwo leagues.  The honorable secretary of the Gun Club wished\r\nhimself to observe the vehicle of his daring friends.\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of the clouds in the atmosphere prevented all\r\nobservation on the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th of December.\r\nIndeed it was thought that all observations would have to be put\r\noff to the 3d of January in the following year; for the moon\r\nentering its last quarter on the 11th, would then only present\r\nan ever-decreasing portion of her disc, insufficient to allow\r\nof their following the course of the projectile.\r\n\r\nAt length, to the general satisfaction, a heavy storm cleared\r\nthe atmosphere on the night of the 11th and 12th of December,\r\nand the moon, with half-illuminated disc, was plainly to be seen\r\nupon the black sky.\r\n\r\nThat very night a telegram was sent from the station of Long's\r\nPeak by Joseph T. Maston and Belfast to the gentlemen of the\r\nCambridge Observatory, announcing that on the 11th of December\r\nat 8h. 47m. P.M., the projectile launched by the Columbiad of\r\nStones Hill had been detected by Messrs. Belfast and Maston--\r\nthat it had deviated from its course from some unknown cause,\r\nand had not reached its destination; but that it had passed near\r\nenough to be retained by the lunar attraction; that its\r\nrectilinear movement had been changed to a circular one, and\r\nthat following an elliptical orbit round the star of night it\r\nhad become its satellite.  The telegram added that the elements\r\nof this new star had not yet been calculated; and indeed three\r\nobservations made upon a star in three different positions are\r\nnecessary to determine these elements.  Then it showed that the\r\ndistance separating the projectile from the lunar surface \"might\"\r\nbe reckoned at about 2,833 miles.\r\n\r\nIt ended with the double hypothesis: either the attraction of\r\nthe moon would draw it to herself, and the travelers thus attain\r\ntheir end; or that the projectile, held in one immutable orbit,\r\nwould gravitate around the lunar disc to all eternity.\r\n\r\nWith such alternatives, what would be the fate of the travelers?\r\nCertainly they had food for some time.  But supposing they did\r\nsucceed in their rash enterprise, how would they return?\r\nCould they ever return?  Should they hear from them?\r\nThese questions, debated by the most learned pens of the day,\r\nstrongly engrossed the public attention.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable here to make a remark which ought to be well\r\nconsidered by hasty observers.  When a purely speculative\r\ndiscovery is announced to the public, it cannot be done with too\r\nmuch prudence.  No one is obliged to discover either a planet,\r\na comet, or a satellite; and whoever makes a mistake in such a\r\ncase exposes himself justly to the derision of the mass.\r\nFar better is it to wait; and that is what the impatient Joseph\r\nT. Maston should have done before sending this telegram forth to\r\nthe world, which, according to his idea, told the whole result\r\nof the enterprise.  Indeed this telegram contained two sorts of\r\nerrors, as was proved eventually.  First, errors of observation,\r\nconcerning the distance of the projectile from the surface of\r\nthe moon, for on the 11th of December it was impossible to see\r\nit; and what Joseph T. Maston had seen, or thought he saw, could\r\nnot have been the projectile of the Columbiad.  Second, errors of\r\ntheory on the fate in store for the said projectile; for in making\r\nit a satellite of the moon, it was putting it in direct\r\ncontradiction of all mechanical laws.\r\n\r\nOne single hypothesis of the observers of Long's Peak could ever\r\nbe realized, that which foresaw the case of the travelers (if\r\nstill alive) uniting their efforts with the lunar attraction to\r\nattain the surface of the disc.\r\n\r\nNow these men, as clever as they were daring, had survived the\r\nterrible shock consequent on their departure, and it is their\r\njourney in the projectile car which is here related in its most\r\ndramatic as well as in its most singular details.  This recital\r\nwill destroy many illusions and surmises; but it will give a\r\ntrue idea of the singular changes in store for such an\r\nenterprise; it will bring out the scientific instincts of\r\nBarbicane, the industrious resources of Nicholl, and the\r\naudacious humor of Michel Ardan.  Besides this, it will prove\r\nthat their worthy friend, Joseph T. Maston, was wasting his\r\ntime, while leaning over the gigantic telescope he watched the\r\ncourse of the moon through the starry space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nTWENTY MINUTES PAST TEN TO FORTY-SEVEN MINUTES PAST TEN P. M.\r\n\r\nAs ten o'clock struck, Michel Ardan, Barbicane, and Nicholl,\r\ntook leave of the numerous friends they were leaving on the earth.\r\nThe two dogs, destined to propagate the canine race on the lunar\r\ncontinents, were already shut up in the projectile.\r\n\r\nThe three travelers approached the orifice of the enormous\r\ncast-iron tube, and a crane let them down to the conical top of\r\nthe projectile.  There, an opening made for the purpose gave\r\nthem access to the aluminum car.  The tackle belonging to the\r\ncrane being hauled from outside, the mouth of the Columbiad was\r\ninstantly disencumbered of its last supports.\r\n\r\nNicholl, once introduced with his companions inside the\r\nprojectile, began to close the opening by means of a strong\r\nplate, held in position by powerful screws.  Other plates,\r\nclosely fitted, covered the lenticular glasses, and the\r\ntravelers, hermetically enclosed in their metal prison, were\r\nplunged in profound darkness.\r\n\r\n\"And now, my dear companions,\" said Michel Ardan, \"let us\r\nmake ourselves at home; I am a domesticated man and strong\r\nin housekeeping.  We are bound to make the best of our new\r\nlodgings, and make ourselves comfortable.  And first let us\r\ntry and see a little.  Gas was not invented for moles.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the thoughtless fellow lit a match by striking it on\r\nthe sole of his boot; and approached the burner fixed to the\r\nreceptacle, in which the carbonized hydrogen, stored at high\r\npressure, sufficed for the lighting and warming of the\r\nprojectile for a hundred and forty-four hours, or six days and\r\nsix nights.  The gas caught fire, and thus lighted the\r\nprojectile looked like a comfortable room with thickly padded\r\nwalls, furnished with a circular divan, and a roof rounded in\r\nthe shape of a dome.\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan examined everything, and declared himself satisfied\r\nwith his installation.\r\n\r\n\"It is a prison,\" said he, \"but a traveling prison; and, with\r\nthe right of putting my nose to the window, I could well stand\r\na lease of a hundred years.  You smile, Barbicane.  Have you any\r\n_arriere-pensee_?  Do you say to yourself, `This prison may be\r\nour tomb?'  Tomb, perhaps; still I would not change it for\r\nMahomet's, which floats in space but never advances an inch!\"\r\n\r\nWhile Michel Ardan was speaking, Barbicane and Nicholl were\r\nmaking their last preparations.\r\n\r\nNicholl's chronometer marked twenty minutes past ten P.M. when\r\nthe three travelers were finally enclosed in their projectile.\r\nThis chronometer was set within the tenth of a second by that of\r\nMurchison the engineer.  Barbicane consulted it.\r\n\r\n\"My friends,\" said he, \"it is twenty minutes past ten.  At forty-\r\nseven minutes past ten Murchison will launch the electric spark\r\non the wire which communicates with the charge of the Columbiad.\r\nAt that precise moment we shall leave our spheroid.  Thus we\r\nstill have twenty-seven minutes to remain on the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-six minutes thirteen seconds,\" replied the methodical Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, in a good-humored tone, \"much\r\nmay be done in twenty-six minutes.  The gravest questions of\r\nmorals and politics may be discussed, and even solved.\r\nTwenty-six minutes well employed are worth more than twenty-six\r\nyears in which nothing is done.  Some seconds of a Pascal or a\r\nNewton are more precious than the whole existence of a crowd of\r\nraw simpletons----\"\r\n\r\n\"And you conclude, then, you everlasting talker?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"I conclude that we have twenty-six minutes left,\" replied Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-four only,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Well, twenty-four, if you like, my noble captain,\" said Ardan;\r\n\"twenty-four minutes in which to investigate----\"\r\n\r\n\"Michel,\" said Barbicane, \"during the passage we shall have\r\nplenty of time to investigate the most difficult questions.\r\nFor the present we must occupy ourselves with our departure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we not ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless; but there are still some precautions to be taken,\r\nto deaden as much as possible the first shock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have we not the water-cushions placed between the partition-\r\nbreaks, whose elasticity will sufficiently protect us?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so, Michel,\" replied Barbicane gently, \"but I am not sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, the joker!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan.  \"He hopes!--He is not\r\nsure!-- and he waits for the moment when we are encased to make\r\nthis deplorable admission!  I beg to be allowed to get out!\"\r\n\r\n\"And how?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" said Michel Ardan, \"it is not easy; we are in the\r\ntrain, and the guard's whistle will sound before twenty-four\r\nminutes are over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\nFor some moments the three travelers looked at each other.\r\nThen they began to examine the objects imprisoned with them.\r\n\r\n\"Everything is in its place,\" said Barbicane.  \"We have now to\r\ndecide how we can best place ourselves to resist the shock.\r\nPosition cannot be an indifferent matter; and we must, as much\r\nas possible, prevent the rush of blood to the head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" replied Michel Ardan, ready to suit the action to the\r\nword, \"let us put our heads down and our feet in the air, like\r\nthe clowns in the grand circus.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Barbicane, \"let us stretch ourselves on our sides; we\r\nshall resist the shock better that way.  Remember that, when the\r\nprojectile starts, it matters little whether we are in it or\r\nbefore it; it amounts to much the same thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it is only `much the same thing,' I may cheer up,\" said\r\nMichel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"Do you approve of my idea, Nicholl?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Entirely,\" replied the captain.  \"We've still thirteen minutes\r\nand a half.\"\r\n\r\n\"That Nicholl is not a man,\" exclaimed Michel; \"he is a\r\nchronometer with seconds, an escape, and eight holes.\"\r\n\r\nBut his companions were not listening; they were taking up their\r\nlast positions with the most perfect coolness.  They were like\r\ntwo methodical travelers in a car, seeking to place themselves\r\nas comfortably as possible.\r\n\r\nWe might well ask ourselves of what materials are the hearts of\r\nthese Americans made, to whom the approach of the most frightful\r\ndanger added no pulsation.\r\n\r\nThree thick and solidly-made couches had been placed in\r\nthe projectile.  Nicholl and Barbicane placed them in the\r\ncenter of the disc forming the floor.  There the three\r\ntravelers were to stretch themselves some moments before\r\ntheir departure.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, Ardan, not being able to keep still, turned in\r\nhis narrow prison like a wild beast in a cage, chatting with his\r\nfriends, speaking to the dogs Diana and Satellite, to whom, as\r\nmay be seen, he had given significant names.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Diana!  Ah, Satellite!\" he exclaimed, teasing them; \"so you\r\nare going to show the moon-dogs the good habits of the dogs of\r\nthe earth!  That will do honor to the canine race!  If ever we\r\ndo come down again, I will bring a cross type of `moon-dogs,'\r\nwhich will make a stir!\"\r\n\r\n\"If there _are_ dogs in the moon,\" said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"There are,\" said Michel Ardan, \"just as there are horses, cows,\r\ndonkeys, and chickens.  I bet that we shall find chickens.\"\r\n\r\n\"A hundred dollars we shall find none!\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Done, my captain!\" replied Ardan, clasping Nicholl's hand.\r\n\"But, by the bye, you have already lost three bets with our\r\npresident, as the necessary funds for the enterprise have been\r\nfound, as the operation of casting has been successful, and\r\nlastly, as the Columbiad has been loaded without accident, six\r\nthousand dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Nicholl.  \"Thirty-seven minutes six seconds past ten.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is understood, captain.  Well, before another quarter of an\r\nhour you will have to count nine thousand dollars to the\r\npresident; four thousand because the Columbiad will not burst,\r\nand five thousand because the projectile will rise more than six\r\nmiles in the air.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have the dollars,\" replied Nicholl, slapping the pocket of\r\nthis coat.  \"I only ask to be allowed to pay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, Nicholl.  I see that you are a man of method, which\r\nI could never be; but indeed you have made a series of bets\r\nof very little advantage to yourself, allow me to tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Because, if you gain the first, the Columbiad will have burst,\r\nand the projectile with it; and Barbicane will no longer be\r\nthere to reimburse your dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"My stake is deposited at the bank in Baltimore,\" replied\r\nBarbicane simply; \"and if Nicholl is not there, it will go to\r\nhis heirs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you practical men!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan; \"I admire you\r\nthe more for not being able to understand you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forty-two minutes past ten!\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Only five minutes more!\" answered Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, five little minutes!\" replied Michel Ardan; \"and we are\r\nenclosed in a projectile, at the bottom of a gun 900 feet long!\r\nAnd under this projectile are rammed 400,000 pounds of gun-cotton,\r\nwhich is equal to 1,600,000 pounds of ordinary powder!  And friend\r\nMurchison, with his chronometer in hand, his eye fixed on the\r\nneedle, his finger on the electric apparatus, is counting the\r\nseconds preparatory to launching us into interplanetary space.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough, Michel, enough!\" said Barbicane, in a serious voice;\r\n\"let us prepare.  A few instants alone separate us from an\r\neventful moment.  One clasp of the hand, my friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, more moved than he wished to\r\nappear; and the three bold companions were united in a last embrace.\r\n\r\n\"God preserve us!\" said the religious Barbicane.\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan and Nicholl stretched themselves on the couches\r\nplaced in the center of the disc.\r\n\r\n\"Forty-seven minutes past ten!\" murmured the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty seconds more!\"  Barbicane quickly put out the gas and\r\nlay down by his companions, and the profound silence was only\r\nbroken by the ticking of the chronometer marking the seconds.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a dreadful shock was felt, and the projectile, under\r\nthe force of six billions of litres of gas, developed by the\r\ncombustion of pyroxyle, mounted into space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST HALF-HOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat had happened?  What effect had this frightful shock produced?\r\nHad the ingenuity of the constructors of the projectile obtained\r\nany happy result?  Had the shock been deadened, thanks to the\r\nsprings, the four plugs, the water-cushions, and the partition-breaks?\r\nHad they been able to subdue the frightful pressure of the initiatory\r\nspeed of more than 11,000 yards, which was enough to traverse Paris\r\nor New York in a second?  This was evidently the question suggested\r\nto the thousand spectators of this moving scene.  They forgot the\r\naim of the journey, and thought only of the travelers.  And if\r\none of them-- Joseph T. Maston for example-- could have cast one\r\nglimpse into the projectile, what would he have seen?\r\n\r\nNothing then.  The darkness was profound.  But its cylindro-\r\nconical partitions had resisted wonderfully.  Not a rent or a\r\ndent anywhere!  The wonderful projectile was not even heated\r\nunder the intense deflagration of the powder, nor liquefied,\r\nas they seemed to fear, in a shower of aluminum.\r\n\r\nThe interior showed but little disorder; indeed, only a few\r\nobjects had been violently thrown toward the roof; but the most\r\nimportant seemed not to have suffered from the shock at all;\r\ntheir fixtures were intact.\r\n\r\nOn the movable disc, sunk down to the bottom by the smashing of\r\nthe partition-breaks and the escape of the water, three bodies\r\nlay apparently lifeless.  Barbicane, Nicholl, and Michel Ardan--\r\ndid they still breathe? or was the projectile nothing now but a\r\nmetal coffin, bearing three corpses into space?\r\n\r\nSome minutes after the departure of the projectile, one of\r\nthe bodies moved, shook its arms, lifted its head, and finally\r\nsucceeded in getting on its knees.  It was Michel Ardan.  He felt\r\nhimself all over, gave a sonorous \"Hem!\" and then said:\r\n\r\n\"Michel Ardan is whole.  How about the others?\"\r\n\r\nThe courageous Frenchman tried to rise, but could not stand.\r\nHis head swam, from the rush of blood; he was blind; he was a\r\ndrunken man.\r\n\r\n\"Bur-r!\" said he.  \"It produces the same effect as two bottles\r\nof Corton, though perhaps less agreeable to swallow.\"\r\nThen, passing his hand several times across his forehead and\r\nrubbing his temples, he called in a firm voice:\r\n\r\n\"Nicholl!  Barbicane!\"\r\n\r\nHe waited anxiously.  No answer; not even a sigh to show that\r\nthe hearts of his companions were still beating.  He called again.\r\nThe same silence.\r\n\r\n\"The devil!\" he exclaimed.  \"They look as if they had fallen\r\nfrom a fifth story on their heads.  Bah!\" he added, with that\r\nimperturbable confidence which nothing could check, \"if a\r\nFrenchman can get on his knees, two Americans ought to be able\r\nto get on their feet.  But first let us light up.\"\r\n\r\nArdan felt the tide of life return by degrees.  His blood became\r\ncalm, and returned to its accustomed circulation.  Another effort\r\nrestored his equilibrium.  He succeeded in rising, drew a match\r\nfrom his pocket, and approaching the burner lighted it.\r\nThe receiver had not suffered at all.  The gas had not escaped.\r\nBesides, the smell would have betrayed it; and in that case\r\nMichel Ardan could not have carried a lighted match with\r\nimpunity through the space filled with hydrogen.  The gas mixing\r\nwith the air would have produced a detonating mixture, and the\r\nexplosion would have finished what the shock had perhaps begun.\r\nWhen the burner was lit, Ardan leaned over the bodies of his\r\ncompanions:  they were lying one on the other, an inert mass,\r\nNicholl above, Barbicane underneath.\r\n\r\nArdan lifted the captain, propped him up against the divan, and\r\nbegan to rub vigorously.  This means, used with judgment,\r\nrestored Nicholl, who opened his eyes, and instantly recovering\r\nhis presence of mind, seized Ardan's hand and looked around him.\r\n\r\n\"And Barbicane?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Each in turn,\" replied Michel Ardan.  \"I began with you,\r\nNicholl, because you were on the top.  Now let us look\r\nto Barbicane.\"  Saying which, Ardan and Nicholl raised the\r\npresident of the Gun Club and laid him on the divan.  He seemed\r\nto have suffered more than either of his companions; he was\r\nbleeding, but Nicholl was reassured by finding that the\r\nhemorrhage came from a slight wound on the shoulder, a mere\r\ngraze, which he bound up carefully.\r\n\r\nStill, Barbicane was a long time coming to himself, which\r\nfrightened his friends, who did not spare friction.\r\n\r\n\"He breathes though,\" said Nicholl, putting his ear to the chest\r\nof the wounded man.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Ardan, \"he breathes like a man who has some\r\nnotion of that daily operation.  Rub, Nicholl; let us rub harder.\"\r\nAnd the two improvised practitioners worked so hard and so well\r\nthat Barbicane recovered his senses.  He opened his eyes, sat up,\r\ntook his two friends by the hands, and his first words were--\r\n\r\n\"Nicholl, are we moving?\"\r\n\r\nNicholl and Ardan looked at each other; they had not yet\r\ntroubled themselves about the projectile; their first thought\r\nhad been for the traveler, not for the car.\r\n\r\n\"Well, are we really moving?\" repeated Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"Or quietly resting on the soil of Florida?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Or at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico?\" added Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"What an idea!\" exclaimed the president.\r\n\r\nAnd this double hypothesis suggested by his companions had the\r\neffect of recalling him to his senses.  In any case they could\r\nnot decide on the position of the projectile.  Its apparent\r\nimmovability, and the want of communication with the outside,\r\nprevented them from solving the question.  Perhaps the projectile\r\nwas unwinding its course through space.  Perhaps after a short\r\nrise it had fallen upon the earth, or even in the Gulf of Mexico--\r\na fall which the narrowness of the peninsula of Florida would\r\nrender not impossible.\r\n\r\nThe case was serious, the problem interesting, and one that must\r\nbe solved as soon as possible.  Thus, highly excited, Barbicane's\r\nmoral energy triumphed over physical weakness, and he rose to\r\nhis feet.  He listened.  Outside was perfect silence; but the\r\nthick padding was enough to intercept all sounds coming from\r\nthe earth.  But one circumstance struck Barbicane, viz., that\r\nthe temperature inside the projectile was singularly high.\r\nThe president drew a thermometer from its case and consulted it.\r\nThe instrument showed 81@ Fahr.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he exclaimed, \"yes, we are moving!  This stifling heat,\r\npenetrating through the partitions of the projectile, is\r\nproduced by its friction on the atmospheric strata.  It will\r\nsoon diminish, because we are already floating in space, and\r\nafter having nearly stifled, we shall have to suffer intense cold.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said Michel Ardan.  \"According to your showing, Barbicane,\r\nwe are already beyond the limits of the terrestrial atmosphere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Without a doubt, Michel.  Listen to me.  It is fifty-five\r\nminutes past ten; we have been gone about eight minutes; and if\r\nour initiatory speed has not been checked by the friction, six\r\nseconds would be enough for us to pass through the forty miles\r\nof atmosphere which surrounds the globe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" replied Nicholl; \"but in what proportion do you\r\nestimate the diminution of speed by friction?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the proportion of one-third, Nicholl.  This diminution is\r\nconsiderable, but according to my calculations it is nothing less.\r\nIf, then, we had an initiatory speed of 12,000 yards, on leaving\r\nthe atmosphere this speed would be reduced to 9,165 yards.  In any\r\ncase we have already passed through this interval, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"And then,\" said Michel Ardan, \"friend Nicholl has lost his two\r\nbets:  four thousand dollars because the Columbiad did not burst;\r\nfive thousand dollars because the projectile has risen more than\r\nsix miles.  Now, Nicholl, pay up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us prove it first,\" said the captain, \"and we will\r\npay afterward.  It is quite possible that Barbicane's reasoning\r\nis correct, and that I have lost my nine thousand dollars.  But a\r\nnew hypothesis presents itself to my mind, and it annuls the wager.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" asked Barbicane quickly.\r\n\r\n\"The hypothesis that, for some reason or other, fire was never\r\nset to the powder, and we have not started at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"My goodness, captain,\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, \"that hypothesis\r\nis not worthy of my brain!  It cannot be a serious one.  For have\r\nwe not been half annihilated by the shock?  Did I not recall you\r\nto life?  Is not the president's shoulder still bleeding from the\r\nblow it has received?\"\r\n\r\n\"Granted,\" replied Nicholl; \"but one question.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear the detonation, which certainly ought to be loud?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Ardan, much surprised; \"certainly I did not hear\r\nthe detonation.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, Barbicane?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I, either.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Well now,\" murmured the president \"why did we not hear the detonation?\"\r\n\r\nThe three friends looked at each other with a disconcerted air.\r\nIt was quite an inexplicable phenomenon.  The projectile had\r\nstarted, and consequently there must have been a detonation.\r\n\r\n\"Let us first find out where we are,\" said Barbicane, \"and let\r\ndown this panel.\"\r\n\r\nThis very simple operation was soon accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe nuts which held the bolts to the outer plates of the\r\nright-hand scuttle gave way under the pressure of the\r\nEnglish wrench.  These bolts were pushed outside, and the\r\nbuffers covered with India-rubber stopped up the holes which let\r\nthem through.  Immediately the outer plate fell back upon its\r\nhinges like a porthole, and the lenticular glass which closed\r\nthe scuttle appeared.  A similar one was let into the thick\r\npartition on the opposite side of the projectile, another in the\r\ntop of the dome, and finally a fourth in the middle of the base.\r\nThey could, therefore, make observations in four different\r\ndirections; the firmament by the side and most direct windows,\r\nthe earth or the moon by the upper and under openings in\r\nthe projectile.\r\n\r\nBarbicane and his two companions immediately rushed to the\r\nuncovered window.  But it was lit by no ray of light.\r\nProfound darkness surrounded them, which, however, did not\r\nprevent the president from exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\"No, my friends, we have not fallen back upon the earth; no, nor\r\nare we submerged in the Gulf of Mexico.  Yes! we are mounting\r\ninto space.  See those stars shining in the night, and that\r\nimpenetrable darkness heaped up between the earth and us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah! hurrah!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan and Nicholl in one voice.\r\n\r\nIndeed, this thick darkness proved that the projectile had left\r\nthe earth, for the soil, brilliantly lit by the moon-beams would\r\nhave been visible to the travelers, if they had been lying on\r\nits surface.  This darkness also showed that the projectile had\r\npassed the atmospheric strata, for the diffused light spread in\r\nthe air would have been reflected on the metal walls, which\r\nreflection was wanting.  This light would have lit the window,\r\nand the window was dark.  Doubt was no longer possible; the\r\ntravelers had left the earth.\r\n\r\n\"I have lost,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"I congratulate you,\" replied Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"Here are the nine thousand dollars,\" said the captain, drawing\r\na roll of paper dollars from his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Will you have a receipt for it?\" asked Barbicane, taking the sum.\r\n\r\n\"If you do not mind,\" answered Nicholl; \"it is more business-like.\"\r\n\r\nAnd coolly and seriously, as if he had been at his strong-box,\r\nthe president drew forth his notebook, tore out a blank leaf,\r\nwrote a proper receipt in pencil, dated and signed it with the\r\nusual flourish, [1] and gave it to the captain, who carefully placed\r\nit in his pocketbook.  Michel Ardan, taking off his hat, bowed to\r\nhis two companions without speaking.  So much formality under such\r\ncircumstances left him speechless.  He had never before seen\r\nanything so \"American.\"\r\n\r\n[1] This is a purely French habit.\r\n\r\nThis affair settled, Barbicane and Nicholl had returned to the\r\nwindow, and were watching the constellations.  The stars looked\r\nlike bright points on the black sky.  But from that side they\r\ncould not see the orb of night, which, traveling from east to\r\nwest, would rise by degrees toward the zenith.  Its absence drew\r\nthe following remark from Ardan:\r\n\r\n\"And the moon; will she perchance fail at our rendezvous?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not alarm yourself,\" said Barbicane; \"our future globe is at\r\nits post, but we cannot see her from this side; let us open the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"As Barbicane was about leaving the window to open the opposite\r\nscuttle, his attention was attracted by the approach of a\r\nbrilliant object.  It was an enormous disc, whose colossal\r\ndimension could not be estimated.  Its face, which was turned to\r\nthe earth, was very bright.  One might have thought it a small\r\nmoon reflecting the light of the large one.  She advanced with\r\ngreat speed, and seemed to describe an orbit round the earth,\r\nwhich would intersect the passage of the projectile.  This body\r\nrevolved upon its axis, and exhibited the phenomena of all\r\ncelestial bodies abandoned in space.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, \"What is that? another projectile?\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane did not answer.  The appearance of this enormous body\r\nsurprised and troubled him.  A collision was possible, and might\r\nbe attended with deplorable results; either the projectile would\r\ndeviate from its path, or a shock, breaking its impetus, might\r\nprecipitate it to earth; or, lastly, it might be irresistibly\r\ndrawn away by the powerful asteroid.  The president caught at a\r\nglance the consequences of these three hypotheses, either of\r\nwhich would, one way or the other, bring their experiment to an\r\nunsuccessful and fatal termination.  His companions stood\r\nsilently looking into space.  The object grew rapidly as it\r\napproached them, and by an optical illusion the projectile\r\nseemed to be throwing itself before it.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, \"we shall run into one another!\"\r\n\r\nInstinctively the travelers drew back.  Their dread was great,\r\nbut it did not last many seconds.  The asteroid passed several\r\nhundred yards from the projectile and disappeared, not so much\r\nfrom the rapidity of its course, as that its face being opposite\r\nthe moon, it was suddenly merged into the perfect darkness of space.\r\n\r\n\"A happy journey to you,\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, with a sigh\r\nof relief.  \"Surely infinity of space is large enough for a poor\r\nlittle projectile to walk through without fear.  Now, what is\r\nthis portentous globe which nearly struck us?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, indeed! you know everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" said Barbicane, \"a simple meteorite, but an enormous one,\r\nwhich the attraction of the earth has retained as a satellite.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan; \"the earth then has\r\ntwo moons like Neptune?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my friends, two moons, though it passes generally for\r\nhaving only one; but this second moon is so small, and its\r\nspeed so great, that the inhabitants of the earth cannot see it.\r\nIt was by noticing disturbances that a French astronomer, M. Petit,\r\nwas able to determine the existence of this second satellite and\r\ncalculate its elements.  According to his observations, this\r\nmeteorite will accomplish its revolution around the earth in\r\nthree hours and twenty minutes, which implies a wonderful rate\r\nof speed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do all astronomers admit the existence of this satellite?\"\r\nasked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Barbicane; \"but if, like us, they had met it, they\r\ncould no longer doubt it.  Indeed, I think that this meteorite,\r\nwhich, had it struck the projectile, would have much embarrassed\r\nus, will give us the means of deciding what our position in\r\nspace is.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" said Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"Because its distance is known, and when we met it, we were\r\nexactly four thousand six hundred and fifty miles from the\r\nsurface of the terrestrial globe.\"\r\n\r\n\"More than two thousand French leagues,\" exclaimed Michel Ardan.\r\n\"That beats the express trains of the pitiful globe called the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think so,\" replied Nicholl, consulting his\r\nchronometer; \"it is eleven o'clock, and it is only thirteen\r\nminutes since we left the American continent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only thirteen minutes?\" said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Nicholl; \"and if our initiatory speed of twelve\r\nthousand yards has been kept up, we shall have made about twenty\r\nthousand miles in the hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all very well, my friends,\" said the president, \"but\r\nthe insoluble question still remains.  Why did we not hear the\r\ndetonation of the Columbiad?\"\r\n\r\nFor want of an answer the conversation dropped, and Barbicane\r\nbegan thoughtfully to let down the shutter of the second side.\r\nHe succeeded; and through the uncovered glass the moon filled\r\nthe projectile with a brilliant light.  Nicholl, as an\r\neconomical man, put out the gas, now useless, and whose\r\nbrilliancy prevented any observation of the inter-planetary space.\r\n\r\nThe lunar disc shone with wonderful purity.  Her rays, no longer\r\nfiltered through the vapory atmosphere of the terrestrial globe,\r\nshone through the glass, filling the air in the interior of the\r\nprojectile with silvery reflections.  The black curtain of the\r\nfirmament in reality heightened the moon's brilliancy, which in\r\nthis void of ether unfavorable to diffusion did not eclipse the\r\nneighboring stars.  The heavens, thus seen, presented quite a\r\nnew aspect, and one which the human eye could never dream of.\r\nOne may conceive the interest with which these bold men watched\r\nthe orb of night, the great aim of their journey.\r\n\r\nIn its motion the earth's satellite was insensibly nearing the\r\nzenith, the mathematical point which it ought to attain\r\nninety-six hours later.  Her mountains, her plains, every\r\nprojection was as clearly discernible to their eyes as if they\r\nwere observing it from some spot upon the earth; but its light\r\nwas developed through space with wonderful intensity.  The disc\r\nshone like a platinum mirror.  Of the earth flying from under\r\ntheir feet, the travelers had lost all recollection.\r\n\r\nIt was captain Nicholl who first recalled their attention to the\r\nvanishing globe.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Michel Ardan, \"do not let us be ungrateful to it.\r\nSince we are leaving our country, let our last looks be directed\r\nto it.  I wish to see the earth once more before it is quite\r\nhidden from my eyes.\"\r\n\r\nTo satisfy his companions, Barbicane began to uncover the window\r\nat the bottom of the projectile, which would allow them to\r\nobserve the earth direct.  The disc, which the force of the\r\nprojection had beaten down to the base, was removed, not\r\nwithout difficulty.  Its fragments, placed carefully against a wall,\r\nmight serve again upon occasion.  Then a circular gap appeared,\r\nnineteen inches in diameter, hollowed out of the lower part of\r\nthe projectile.  A glass cover, six inches thick and strengthened\r\nwith upper fastenings, closed it tightly.  Beneath was fixed an\r\naluminum plate, held in place by bolts.  The screws being undone,\r\nand the bolts let go, the plate fell down, and visible\r\ncommunication was established between the interior and the exterior.\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan knelt by the glass.  It was cloudy, seemingly opaque.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" he exclaimed, \"and the earth?\"\r\n\r\n\"The earth?\" said Barbicane.  \"There it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! that little thread; that silver crescent?\"\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless, Michel.  In four days, when the moon will be full,\r\nat the very time we shall reach it, the earth will be new, and\r\nwill only appear to us as a slender crescent which will soon\r\ndisappear, and for some days will be enveloped in utter darkness.\"\r\n\r\n\"That the earth?\" repeated Michel Ardan, looking with all his\r\neyes at the thin slip of his native planet.\r\n\r\nThe explanation given by President Barbicane was correct.\r\nThe earth, with respect to the projectile, was entering its\r\nlast phase.  It was in its octant, and showed a crescent finely\r\ntraced on the dark background of the sky.  Its light, rendered\r\nbluish by the thick strata of the atmosphere was less intense\r\nthan that of the crescent moon, but it was of considerable\r\ndimensions, and looked like an enormous arch stretched across\r\nthe firmament.  Some parts brilliantly lighted, especially on\r\nits concave part, showed the presence of high mountains, often\r\ndisappearing behind thick spots, which are never seen on the\r\nlunar disc.  They were rings of clouds placed concentrically\r\nround the terrestrial globe.\r\n\r\nWhile the travelers were trying to pierce the profound darkness,\r\na brilliant cluster of shooting stars burst upon their eyes.\r\nHundreds of meteorites, ignited by the friction of the\r\natmosphere, irradiated the shadow of the luminous train, and\r\nlined the cloudy parts of the disc with their fire.  At this\r\nperiod the earth was in its perihelion, and the month of\r\nDecember is so propitious to these shooting stars, that\r\nastronomers have counted as many as twenty-four thousand in\r\nan hour.  But Michel Ardan, disdaining scientific reasonings,\r\npreferred thinking that the earth was thus saluting the\r\ndeparture of her three children with her most brilliant fireworks.\r\n\r\nIndeed this was all they saw of the globe lost in the solar\r\nworld, rising and setting to the great planets like a simple\r\nmorning or evening star!  This globe, where they had left all\r\ntheir affections, was nothing more than a fugitive crescent!\r\n\r\nLong did the three friends look without speaking, though united\r\nin heart, while the projectile sped onward with an\r\never-decreasing speed.  Then an irresistible drowsiness crept\r\nover their brain.  Was it weariness of body and mind?  No doubt;\r\nfor after the over-excitement of those last hours passed upon\r\nearth, reaction was inevitable.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Nicholl, \"since we must sleep, let us sleep.\"\r\n\r\nAnd stretching themselves on their couches, they were all three\r\nsoon in a profound slumber.\r\n\r\nBut they had not forgotten themselves more than a quarter of an\r\nhour, when Barbicane sat up suddenly, and rousing his companions\r\nwith a loud voice, exclaimed----\r\n\r\n\"I have found it!\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you found?\" asked Michel Ardan, jumping from his bed.\r\n\r\n\"The reason why we did not hear the detonation of the Columbiad.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it is----?\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Because our projectile traveled faster than the sound!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEIR PLACE OF SHELTER\r\n\r\n\r\nThis curious but certainly correct explanation once given, the\r\nthree friends returned to their slumbers.  Could they have found\r\na calmer or more peaceful spot to sleep in?  On the earth,\r\nhouses, towns, cottages, and country feel every shock given to\r\nthe exterior of the globe.  On sea, the vessels rocked by the\r\nwaves are still in motion; in the air, the balloon oscillates\r\nincessantly on the fluid strata of divers densities.\r\nThis projectile alone, floating in perfect space, in the midst\r\nof perfect silence, offered perfect repose.\r\n\r\nThus the sleep of our adventurous travelers might have been\r\nindefinitely prolonged, if an unexpected noise had not awakened\r\nthem at about seven o'clock in the morning of the 2nd of\r\nDecember, eight hours after their departure.\r\n\r\nThis noise was a very natural barking.\r\n\r\n\"The dogs! it is the dogs!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, rising at once.\r\n\r\n\"They are hungry,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" replied Michel, \"we have forgotten them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are they?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\nThey looked and found one of the animals crouched under the divan.\r\nTerrified and shaken by the initiatory shock, it had remained\r\nin the corner till its voice returned with the pangs of hunger.\r\nIt was the amiable Diana, still very confused, who crept out of\r\nher retreat, though not without much persuasion, Michel Ardan\r\nencouraging her with most gracious words.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Diana,\" said he:  \"come, my girl! thou whose destiny will\r\nbe marked in the cynegetic annals; thou whom the pagans would\r\nhave given as companion to the god Anubis, and Christians as\r\nfriend to St. Roch; thou who art rushing into interplanetary\r\nspace, and wilt perhaps be the Eve of all Selenite dogs! come,\r\nDiana, come here.\"\r\n\r\nDiana, flattered or not, advanced by degrees, uttering\r\nplaintive cries.\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" said Barbicane:  \"I see Eve, but where is Adam?\"\r\n\r\n\"Adam?\" replied Michel; \"Adam cannot be far off; he is there\r\nsomewhere; we must call him.  Satellite! here, Satellite!\"\r\n\r\nBut Satellite did not appear.  Diana would not leave off howling.\r\nThey found, however, that she was not bruised, and they gave her\r\na pie, which silenced her complaints.  As to Satellite, he seemed\r\nquite lost.  They had to hunt a long time before finding him in\r\none of the upper compartments of the projectile, whither some\r\nunaccountable shock must have violently hurled him.  The poor\r\nbeast, much hurt, was in a piteous state.\r\n\r\n\"The devil!\" said Michel.\r\n\r\nThey brought the unfortunate dog down with great care.  Its skull\r\nhad been broken against the roof, and it seemed unlikely that he\r\ncould recover from such a shock.  Meanwhile, he was stretched\r\ncomfortably on a cushion.  Once there, he heaved a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"We will take care of you,\" said Michel; \"we are responsible for\r\nyour existence.  I would rather lose an arm than a paw of my\r\npoor Satellite.\"\r\n\r\nSaying which, he offered some water to the wounded dog, who\r\nswallowed it with avidity.\r\n\r\nThis attention paid, the travelers watched the earth and the\r\nmoon attentively.  The earth was now only discernible by a\r\ncloudy disc ending in a crescent, rather more contracted than\r\nthat of the previous evening; but its expanse was still\r\nenormous, compared with that of the moon, which was approaching\r\nnearer and nearer to a perfect circle.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" said Michel Ardan, \"I am really sorry that we did not\r\nstart when the earth was full, that is to say, when our globe\r\nwas in opposition to the sun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Because we should have seen our continents and seas in a new\r\nlight-- the first resplendent under the solar rays, the latter\r\ncloudy as represented on some maps of the world.  I should like\r\nto have seen those poles of the earth on which the eye of man\r\nhas never yet rested.\r\n\r\n\"I dare say,\" replied Barbicane; \"but if the earth had been\r\n_full_, the moon would have been _new_; that is to say,\r\ninvisible, because of the rays of the sun.  It is better\r\nfor us to see the destination we wish to reach, than the point\r\nof departure.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Barbicane,\" replied Captain Nicholl; \"and,\r\nbesides, when we have reached the moon, we shall have time\r\nduring the long lunar nights to consider at our leisure the\r\nglobe on which our likenesses swarm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our likenesses!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan; \"They are no more our\r\nlikenesses than the Selenites are!  We inhabit a new world,\r\npeopled by ourselves-- the projectile!  I am Barbicane's\r\nlikeness, and Barbicane is Nicholl's.  Beyond us, around us,\r\nhuman nature is at an end, and we are the only population of\r\nthis microcosm until we become pure Selenites.\"\r\n\r\n\"In about eighty-eight hours,\" replied the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Which means to say?\" asked Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"That it is half-past eight,\" replied Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" retorted Michel; \"then it is impossible for me to\r\nfind even the shadow of a reason why we should not go to breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed the inhabitants of the new star could not live without\r\neating, and their stomachs were suffering from the imperious\r\nlaws of hunger.  Michel Ardan, as a Frenchman, was declared\r\nchief cook, an important function, which raised no rival.\r\nThe gas gave sufficient heat for the culinary apparatus, and\r\nthe provision box furnished the elements of this first feast.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast began with three bowls of excellent soup, thanks to\r\nthe liquefaction in hot water of those precious cakes of Liebig,\r\nprepared from the best parts of the ruminants of the Pampas.\r\nTo the soup succeeded some beefsteaks, compressed by an hydraulic\r\npress, as tender and succulent as if brought straight from the\r\nkitchen of an English eating-house.  Michel, who was imaginative,\r\nmaintained that they were even \"red.\"\r\n\r\nPreserved vegetables (\"fresher than nature,\" said the amiable\r\nMichel) succeeded the dish of meat; and was followed by some\r\ncups of tea with bread and butter, after the American fashion.\r\n\r\nThe beverage was declared exquisite, and was due to the\r\ninfusion of the choicest leaves, of which the emperor of Russia\r\nhad given some chests for the benefit of the travelers.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, to crown the repast, Ardan had brought out a fine\r\nbottle of Nuits, which was found \"by chance\" in the\r\nprovision-box.  The three friends drank to the union of the\r\nearth and her satellite.\r\n\r\nAnd, as if he had not already done enough for the generous wine\r\nwhich he had distilled on the slopes of Burgundy, the sun chose\r\nto be part of the party.  At this moment the projectile emerged\r\nfrom the conical shadow cast by the terrestrial globe, and the\r\nrays of the radiant orb struck the lower disc of the projectile\r\ndirect occasioned by the angle which the moon's orbit makes with\r\nthat of the earth.\r\n\r\n\"The sun!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt,\" replied Barbicane; \"I expected it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Michel, \"the conical shadow which the earth leaves\r\nin space extends beyond the moon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Far beyond it, if the atmospheric refraction is not taken into\r\nconsideration,\" said Barbicane.  \"But when the moon is enveloped\r\nin this shadow, it is because the centers of the three stars,\r\nthe sun, the earth, and the moon, are all in one and the same\r\nstraight line.  Then the _nodes_ coincide with the _phases_ of\r\nthe moon, and there is an eclipse.  If we had started when there\r\nwas an eclipse of the moon, all our passage would have been in\r\nthe shadow, which would have been a pity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because, though we are floating in space, our projectile,\r\nbathed in the solar rays, will receive light and heat.\r\nIt economizes the gas, which is in every respect a good economy.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, under these rays which no atmosphere can temper, either\r\nin temperature or brilliancy, the projectile grew warm and\r\nbright, as if it had passed suddenly from winter to summer.\r\nThe moon above, the sun beneath, were inundating it with their fire.\r\n\r\n\"It is pleasant here,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"I should think so,\" said Michel Ardan.  \"With a little earth\r\nspread on our aluminum planet we should have green peas in\r\ntwenty-four hours.  I have but one fear, which is that the\r\nwalls of the projectile might melt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Calm yourself, my worthy friend,\" replied Barbicane; \"the\r\nprojectile withstood a very much higher temperature than this as\r\nit slid through the strata of the atmosphere.  I should not be\r\nsurprised if it did not look like a meteor on fire to the eyes\r\nof the spectators in Florida.\"\r\n\r\n\"But then J. T. Maston will think we are roasted!\"\r\n\r\n\"What astonishes me,\" said Barbicane, \"is that we have not been.\r\nThat was a danger we had not provided for.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feared it,\" said Nicholl simply.\r\n\r\n\"And you never mentioned it, my sublime captain,\" exclaimed\r\nMichel Ardan, clasping his friend's hand.\r\n\r\nBarbicane now began to settle himself in the projectile as if he\r\nwas never to leave it.  One must remember that this aerial car\r\nhad a base with a _superficies_ of fifty-four square feet.\r\nIts height to the roof was twelve feet.  Carefully laid out in\r\nthe inside, and little encumbered by instruments and traveling\r\nutensils, which each had their particular place, it left the\r\nthree travelers a certain freedom of movement.  The thick window\r\ninserted in the bottom could bear any amount of weight, and\r\nBarbicane and his companions walked upon it as if it were solid\r\nplank; but the sun striking it directly with its rays lit the\r\ninterior of the projectile from beneath, thus producing singular\r\neffects of light.\r\n\r\nThey began by investigating the state of their store of water\r\nand provisions, neither of which had suffered, thanks to the\r\ncare taken to deaden the shock.  Their provisions were abundant,\r\nand plentiful enough to last the three travelers for more than\r\na year.  Barbicane wished to be cautious, in case the projectile\r\nshould land on a part of the moon which was utterly barren.\r\nAs to water and the reserve of brandy, which consisted of fifty\r\ngallons, there was only enough for two months; but according to\r\nthe last observations of astronomers, the moon had a low, dense,\r\nand thick atmosphere, at least in the deep valleys, and there\r\nsprings and streams could not fail.  Thus, during their passage,\r\nand for the first year of their settlement on the lunar\r\ncontinent, these adventurous explorers would suffer neither\r\nhunger nor thirst.\r\n\r\nNow about the air in the projectile.  There, too, they were secure.\r\nReiset and Regnaut's apparatus, intended for the production of\r\noxygen, was supplied with chlorate of potassium for two months.\r\nThey necessarily consumed a certain quantity of gas, for they\r\nwere obliged to keep the producing substance at a temperature\r\nof above 400@.  But there again they were all safe.  The apparatus\r\nonly wanted a little care.  But it was not enough to renew the\r\noxygen; they must absorb the carbonic acid produced by expiration.\r\nDuring the last twelve hours the atmosphere of the projectile had\r\nbecome charged with this deleterious gas.  Nicholl discovered\r\nthe state of the air by observing Diana panting painfully.\r\nThe carbonic acid, by a phenomenon similar to that produced in\r\nthe famous Grotto del Cane, had collected at the bottom of the\r\nprojectile owing to its weight.  Poor Diana, with her head low,\r\nwould suffer before her masters from the presence of this gas.\r\nBut Captain Nicholl hastened to remedy this state of things,\r\nby placing on the floor several receivers containing caustic\r\npotash, which he shook about for a time, and this substance,\r\ngreedy of carbonic acid, soon completely absorbed it, thus\r\npurifying the air.\r\n\r\nAn inventory of instruments was then begun.  The thermometers\r\nand barometers had resisted, all but one minimum thermometer,\r\nthe glass of which was broken.  An excellent aneroid was drawn\r\nfrom the wadded box which contained it and hung on the wall.\r\nOf course it was only affected by and marked the pressure of the\r\nair inside the projectile, but it also showed the quantity of\r\nmoisture which it contained.  At that moment its needle\r\noscillated between 25.24 and 25.08.\r\n\r\nIt was fine weather.\r\n\r\nBarbicane had also brought several compasses, which he found intact.\r\nOne must understand that under present conditions their needles\r\nwere acting _wildly_, that is without any _constant_ direction.\r\nIndeed, at the distance they were from the earth, the magnetic\r\npole could have no perceptible action upon the apparatus; but\r\nthe box placed on the lunar disc might perhaps exhibit some\r\nstrange phenomena.  In any case it would be interesting to see\r\nwhether the earth's satellite submitted like herself to its\r\nmagnetic influence.\r\n\r\nA hypsometer to measure the height of the lunar mountains, a\r\nsextant to take the height of the sun, glasses which would be\r\nuseful as they neared the moon, all these instruments were\r\ncarefully looked over, and pronounced good in spite of the\r\nviolent shock.\r\n\r\nAs to the pickaxes and different tools which were Nicholl's\r\nespecial choice; as to the sacks of different kinds of grain and\r\nshrubs which Michel Ardan hoped to transplant into Selenite\r\nground, they were stowed away in the upper part of the projectile.\r\nThere was a sort of granary there, loaded with things which the\r\nextravagant Frenchman had heaped up.  What they were no one knew,\r\nand the good-tempered fellow did not explain.  Now and then he\r\nclimbed up by cramp-irons riveted to the walls, but kept the\r\ninspection to himself.  He arranged and rearranged, he plunged\r\nhis hand rapidly into certain mysterious boxes, singing in one\r\nof the falsest of voices an old French refrain to enliven\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\nBarbicane observed with some interest that his guns and other\r\narms had not been damaged.  These were important, because,\r\nheavily loaded, they were to help lessen the fall of the\r\nprojectile, when drawn by the lunar attraction (after having\r\npassed the point of neutral attraction) on to the moon's\r\nsurface; a fall which ought to be six times less rapid than it\r\nwould have been on the earth's surface, thanks to the difference\r\nof bulk.  The inspection ended with general satisfaction, when\r\neach returned to watch space through the side windows and the\r\nlower glass coverlid.\r\n\r\nThere was the same view.  The whole extent of the celestial\r\nsphere swarmed with stars and constellations of wonderful\r\npurity, enough to drive an astronomer out of his mind!  On one\r\nside the sun, like the mouth of a lighted oven, a dazzling disc\r\nwithout a halo, standing out on the dark background of the sky!\r\nOn the other, the moon returning its fire by reflection, and\r\napparently motionless in the midst of the starry world.  Then, a\r\nlarge spot seemingly nailed to the firmament, bordered by a\r\nsilvery cord; it was the earth!  Here and there nebulous masses\r\nlike large flakes of starry snow; and from the zenith to the nadir,\r\nan immense ring formed by an impalpable dust of stars, the \"Milky\r\nWay,\" in the midst of which the sun ranks only as a star of the\r\nfourth magnitude.  The observers could not take their eyes from\r\nthis novel spectacle, of which no description could give an\r\nadequate idea.  What reflections it suggested!  What emotions\r\nhitherto unknown awoke in their souls!  Barbicane wished to begin\r\nthe relation of his journey while under its first impressions,\r\nand hour after hour took notes of all facts happening in the\r\nbeginning of the enterprise.  He wrote quietly, with his large\r\nsquare writing, in a business-like style.\r\n\r\nDuring this time Nicholl, the calculator, looked over the\r\nminutes of their passage, and worked out figures with\r\nunparalleled dexterity.  Michel Ardan chatted first with\r\nBarbicane, who did not answer him, and then with Nicholl, who\r\ndid not hear him, with Diana, who understood none of his\r\ntheories, and lastly with himself, questioning and answering,\r\ngoing and coming, busy with a thousand details; at one time bent\r\nover the lower glass, at another roosting in the heights of the\r\nprojectile, and always singing.  In this microcosm he\r\nrepresented French loquacity and excitability, and we beg you to\r\nbelieve that they were well represented.  The day, or rather\r\n(for the expression is not correct) the lapse of twelve hours,\r\nwhich forms a day upon the earth, closed with a plentiful supper\r\ncarefully prepared.  No accident of any nature had yet happened\r\nto shake the travelers' confidence; so, full of hope, already\r\nsure of success, they slept peacefully, while the projectile\r\nunder an uniformly decreasing speed was crossing the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nA LITTLE ALGEBRA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night passed without incident.  The word \"night,\" however,\r\nis scarcely applicable.\r\n\r\nThe position of the projectile with regard to the sun did\r\nnot change.  Astronomically, it was daylight on the lower part,\r\nand night on the upper; so when during this narrative these\r\nwords are used, they represent the lapse of time between rising\r\nand setting of the sun upon the earth.\r\n\r\nThe travelers' sleep was rendered more peaceful by the\r\nprojectile's excessive speed, for it seemed absolutely motionless.\r\nNot a motion betrayed its onward course through space.  The rate\r\nof progress, however rapid it might be, cannot produce any\r\nsensible effect on the human frame when it takes place in a\r\nvacuum, or when the mass of air circulates with the body which\r\nis carried with it.  What inhabitant of the earth perceives its\r\nspeed, which, however, is at the rate of 68,000 miles per hour?\r\nMotion under such conditions is \"felt\" no more than repose; and\r\nwhen a body is in repose it will remain so as long as no strange\r\nforce displaces it; if moving, it will not stop unless an\r\nobstacle comes in its way.  This indifference to motion or\r\nrepose is called inertia.\r\n\r\nBarbicane and his companions might have believed themselves\r\nperfectly stationary, being shut up in the projectile; indeed,\r\nthe effect would have been the same if they had been on the\r\noutside of it.  Had it not been for the moon, which was\r\nincreasing above them, they might have sworn that they were\r\nfloating in complete stagnation.\r\n\r\nThat morning, the 3rd of December, the travelers were awakened by\r\na joyous but unexpected noise; it was the crowing of a cock\r\nwhich sounded through the car.  Michel Ardan, who was the first\r\non his feet, climbed to the top of the projectile, and shutting\r\na box, the lid of which was partly open, said in a low voice,\r\n\"Will you hold your tongue?  That creature will spoil my design!\"\r\n\r\nBut Nicholl and Barbicane were awake.\r\n\r\n\"A cock!\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Why no, my friends,\" Michel answered quickly; \"it was I who\r\nwished to awake you by this rural sound.\"  So saying, he gave\r\nvent to a splendid cock-a-doodledoo, which would have done honor\r\nto the proudest of poultry-yards.\r\n\r\nThe two Americans could not help laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Fine talent that,\" said Nicholl, looking suspiciously at his companion.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Michel; \"a joke in my country.  It is very Gallic;\r\nthey play the cock so in the best society.\"\r\n\r\nThen turning the conversation:\r\n\r\n\"Barbicane, do you know what I have been thinking of all night?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered the president.\r\n\r\n\"Of our Cambridge friends.  You have already remarked that I am\r\nan ignoramus in mathematical subjects; and it is impossible for\r\nme to find out how the savants of the observatory were able to\r\ncalculate what initiatory speed the projectile ought to have on\r\nleaving the Columbiad in order to attain the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean to say,\" replied Barbicane, \"to attain that neutral\r\npoint where the terrestrial and lunar attractions are equal;\r\nfor, starting from that point, situated about nine-tenths of the\r\ndistance traveled over, the projectile would simply fall upon\r\nthe moon, on account of its weight.\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it,\" said Michel; \"but, once more; how could they\r\ncalculate the initiatory speed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing can be easier,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"And you knew how to make that calculation?\" asked Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly.  Nicholl and I would have made it, if the\r\nobservatory had not saved us the trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, old Barbicane,\" replied Michel; \"they might have cut\r\noff my head, beginning at my feet, before they could have made\r\nme solve that problem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you do not know algebra,\" answered Barbicane quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, there you are, you eaters of _x_^1; you think you have said\r\nall when you have said `Algebra.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Michel,\" said Barbicane, \"can you use a forge without a hammer,\r\nor a plow without a plowshare?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, algebra is a tool, like the plow or the hammer, and a\r\ngood tool to those who know how to use it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seriously?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite seriously.\"\r\n\r\n\"And can you use that tool in my presence?\"\r\n\r\n\"If it will interest you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And show me how they calculated the initiatory speed of our car?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my worthy friend; taking into consideration all the\r\nelements of the problem, the distance from the center of the\r\nearth to the center of the moon, of the radius of the earth, of\r\nits bulk, and of the bulk of the moon, I can tell exactly what\r\nought to be the initiatory speed of the projectile, and that by\r\na simple formula.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us see.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall see it; only I shall not give you the real course\r\ndrawn by the projectile between the moon and the earth in\r\nconsidering their motion round the sun.  No, I shall consider\r\nthese two orbs as perfectly motionless, which will answer all\r\nour purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it will be trying to solve the problem called `the\r\nproblem of the three bodies,' for which the integral calculus is\r\nnot yet far enough advanced.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Michel Ardan, in his sly tone, \"mathematics have\r\nnot said their last word?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps the Selenites have carried the integral calculus\r\nfarther than you have; and, by the bye, what is this\r\n`integral calculus?'\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a calculation the converse of the differential,\" replied\r\nBarbicane seriously.\r\n\r\n\"Much obliged; it is all very clear, no doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" continued Barbicane, \"a slip of paper and a bit of\r\npencil, and before a half-hour is over I will have found the\r\nrequired formula.\"\r\n\r\nHalf an hour had not elapsed before Barbicane, raising his head,\r\nshowed Michel Ardan a page covered with algebraical signs, in\r\nwhich the general formula for the solution was contained.\r\n\r\n\"Well, and does Nicholl understand what that means?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, Michel,\" replied the captain.  \"All these signs,\r\nwhich seem cabalistic to you, form the plainest, the clearest,\r\nand the most logical language to those who know how to read it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you pretend, Nicholl,\" asked Michel, \"that by means of\r\nthese hieroglyphics, more incomprehensible than the Egyptian\r\nIbis, you can find what initiatory speed it was necessary to\r\ngive the projectile?\"\r\n\r\n\"Incontestably,\" replied Nicholl; \"and even by this same formula\r\nI can always tell you its speed at any point of its transit.\"\r\n\r\n\"On your word?\"\r\n\r\n\"On my word.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you are as cunning as our president.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Michel; the difficult part is what Barbicane has done; that\r\nis, to get an equation which shall satisfy all the conditions of\r\nthe problem.  The remainder is only a question of arithmetic,\r\nrequiring merely the knowledge of the four rules.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is something!\" replied Michel Ardan, who for his life\r\ncould not do addition right, and who defined the rule as a\r\nChinese puzzle, which allowed one to obtain all sorts of totals.\r\n\r\n\"The expression _v_ zero, which you see in that equation, is the\r\nspeed which the projectile will have on leaving the atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" said Nicholl; \"it is from that point that we must\r\ncalculate the velocity, since we know already that the velocity\r\nat departure was exactly one and a half times more than on\r\nleaving the atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand no more,\" said Michel.\r\n\r\n\"It is a very simple calculation,\" said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Not as simple as I am,\" retorted Michel.\r\n\r\n\"That means, that when our projectile reached the limits of the\r\nterrestrial atmosphere it had already lost one-third of its\r\ninitiatory speed.\"\r\n\r\n\"As much as that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my friend; merely by friction against the atmospheric strata.\r\nYou understand that the faster it goes the more resistance it meets\r\nwith from the air.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I admit,\" answered Michel; \"and I understand it,\r\nalthough your x's and zero's, and algebraic formula, are\r\nrattling in my head like nails in a bag.\"\r\n\r\n\"First effects of algebra,\" replied Barbicane; \"and now, to\r\nfinish, we are going to prove the given number of these\r\ndifferent expressions, that is, work out their value.\"\r\n\r\n\"Finish me!\" replied Michel.\r\n\r\nBarbicane took the paper, and began to make his calculations\r\nwith great rapidity.  Nicholl looked over and greedily read the\r\nwork as it proceeded.\r\n\r\n\"That's it! that's it!\" at last he cried.\r\n\r\n\"Is it clear?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"It is written in letters of fire,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful fellows!\" muttered Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"Do you understand it at last?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Do I understand it?\" cried Ardan; \"my head is splitting with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Nicholl, \"to find out the speed of the\r\nprojectile when it leaves the atmosphere, we have only to\r\ncalculate that.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain, as a practical man equal to all difficulties, began\r\nto write with frightful rapidity.  Divisions and multiplications\r\ngrew under his fingers; the figures were like hail on the white page.\r\nBarbicane watched him, while Michel Ardan nursed a growing headache\r\nwith both hands.\r\n\r\n\"Very well?\" asked Barbicane, after some minutes' silence.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" replied Nicholl; every calculation made, _v_ zero, that\r\nis to say, the speed necessary for the projectile on leaving the\r\natmosphere, to enable it to reach the equal point of attraction,\r\nought to be----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Twelve thousand yards.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed Barbicane, starting; \"you say----\"\r\n\r\n\"Twelve thousand yards.\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil!\" cried the president, making a gesture of despair.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Michel Ardan, much surprised.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter! why, if at this moment our speed had\r\nalready diminished one-third by friction, the initiatory speed\r\nought to have been----\"\r\n\r\n\"Seventeen thousand yards.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the Cambridge Observatory declared that twelve thousand\r\nyards was enough at starting; and our projectile, which only\r\nstarted with that speed----\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it will not be enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall not be able to reach the neutral point.\"\r\n\r\n\"The deuce!\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall not even get halfway.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the name of the projectile!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, jumping\r\nas if it was already on the point of striking the terrestrial globe.\r\n\r\n\"And we shall fall back upon the earth!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLD OF SPACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis revelation came like a thunderbolt.  Who could have\r\nexpected such an error in calculation?  Barbicane would not\r\nbelieve it.  Nicholl revised his figures: they were exact.\r\nAs to the formula which had determined them, they could not\r\nsuspect its truth; it was evident that an initiatory velocity of\r\nseventeen thousand yards in the first second was necessary to\r\nenable them to reach the neutral point.\r\n\r\nThe three friends looked at each other silently.  There was no\r\nthought of breakfast.  Barbicane, with clenched teeth, knitted\r\nbrows, and hands clasped convulsively, was watching through\r\nthe window.  Nicholl had crossed his arms, and was examining\r\nhis calculations.  Michel Ardan was muttering:\r\n\r\n\"That is just like these scientific men:  they never do anything else.\r\nI would give twenty pistoles if we could fall upon the Cambridge\r\nObservatory and crush it, together with the whole lot of dabblers\r\nin figures which it contains.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly a thought struck the captain, which he at once\r\ncommunicated to Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said he; \"it is seven o'clock in the morning; we have\r\nalready been gone thirty-two hours; more than half our passage\r\nis over, and we are not falling that I am aware of.\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane did not answer, but after a rapid glance at the\r\ncaptain, took a pair of compasses wherewith to measure the\r\nangular distance of the terrestrial globe; then from the lower\r\nwindow he took an exact observation, and noticed that the\r\nprojectile was apparently stationary.  Then rising and wiping\r\nhis forehead, on which large drops of perspiration were\r\nstanding, he put some figures on paper.  Nicholl understood that\r\nthe president was deducting from the terrestrial diameter the\r\nprojectile's distance from the earth.  He watched him anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" exclaimed Barbicane, after some moments, \"no, we are not\r\nfalling! no, we are already more than 50,000 leagues from the earth.\r\nWe have passed the point at which the projectile would have stopped\r\nif its speed had only been 12,000 yards at starting.  We are still\r\ngoing up.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is evident,\" replied Nicholl; \"and we must conclude that\r\nour initial speed, under the power of the 400,000 pounds of\r\ngun-cotton, must have exceeded the required 12,000 yards.\r\nNow I can understand how, after thirteen minutes only, we met the\r\nsecond satellite, which gravitates round the earth at more than\r\n2,000 leagues' distance.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this explanation is the more probable,\" added Barbicane,\r\n\"Because, in throwing off the water enclosed between its\r\npartition-breaks, the projectile found itself lightened of a\r\nconsiderable weight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, my brave Nicholl, we are saved!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well then,\" said Michel Ardan quietly; \"as we are safe,\r\nlet us have breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nNicholl was not mistaken.  The initial speed had been, very\r\nfortunately, much above that estimated by the Cambridge\r\nObservatory; but the Cambridge Observatory had nevertheless made\r\na mistake.\r\n\r\nThe travelers, recovered from this false alarm, breakfasted merrily.\r\nIf they ate a good deal, they talked more.  Their confidence was\r\ngreater after than before \"the incident of the algebra.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should we not succeed?\" said Michel Ardan; \"why should we\r\nnot arrive safely?  We are launched; we have no obstacle before\r\nus, no stones in the way; the road is open, more so than that of\r\na ship battling with the sea; more open than that of a balloon\r\nbattling with the wind; and if a ship can reach its destination,\r\na balloon go where it pleases, why cannot our projectile attain\r\nits end and aim?\"\r\n\r\n\"It _will_ attain it,\" said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"If only to do honor to the Americans,\" added Michel Ardan, \"the\r\nonly people who could bring such an enterprise to a happy termination,\r\nand the only one which could produce a President Barbicane.  Ah, now\r\nwe are no longer uneasy, I begin to think, What will become of us?\r\nWe shall get right royally weary.\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane and Nicholl made a gesture of denial.\r\n\r\n\"But I have provided for the contingency, my friends,\" replied\r\nMichel; \"you have only to speak, and I have chess, draughts,\r\ncards, and dominoes at your disposal; nothing is wanting but a\r\nbilliard-table.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed Barbicane; \"you brought away such trifles?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied Michel, \"and not only to distract\r\nourselves, but also with the laudable intention of endowing the\r\nSelenite smoking divans with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend,\" said Barbicane, \"if the moon is inhabited, its\r\ninhabitants must have appeared some thousands of years before\r\nthose of the earth, for we cannot doubt that their star is much\r\nolder than ours.  If then these Selenites have existed their\r\nhundreds of thousands of years, and if their brain is of the same\r\norganization of the human brain, they have already invented all\r\nthat we have invented, and even what we may invent in future ages.\r\nThey have nothing to learn from _us_, and we have everything to\r\nlearn from _them_.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said Michel; \"you believe that they have artists like\r\nPhidias, Michael Angelo, or Raphael?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poets like Homer, Virgil, Milton, Lamartine, and Hugo?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Kant?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Scientific men like Archimedes, Euclid, Pascal, Newton?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could swear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Comic writers like Arnal, and photographers like-- like Nadar?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, friend Barbicane, if they are as strong as we are, and\r\neven stronger-- these Selenites-- why have they not tried to\r\ncommunicate with the earth? why have they not launched a lunar\r\nprojectile to our terrestrial regions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who told you that they have never done so?\" said Barbicane seriously.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" added Nicholl, \"it would be easier for them than for\r\nus, for two reasons; first, because the attraction on the moon's\r\nsurface is six times less than on that of the earth, which would\r\nallow a projectile to rise more easily; secondly, because it\r\nwould be enough to send such a projectile only at 8,000 leagues\r\ninstead of 80,000, which would require the force of projection\r\nto be ten times less strong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" continued Michel, \"I repeat it, why have they not done it?\"\r\n\r\n\"And I repeat,\" said Barbicane; \"who told you that they have not\r\ndone it?\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thousands of years before man appeared on earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the projectile-- where is the projectile?  I demand to see\r\nthe projectile.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend,\" replied Barbicane, \"the sea covers five-sixths of\r\nour globe.  From that we may draw five good reasons for\r\nsupposing that the lunar projectile, if ever launched, is now at\r\nthe bottom of the Atlantic or the Pacific, unless it sped into\r\nsome crevasse at that period when the crust of the earth was not\r\nyet hardened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Old Barbicane,\" said Michel, \"you have an answer for\r\neverything, and I bow before your wisdom.  But there is one\r\nhypothesis that would suit me better than all the others, which\r\nis, the Selenites, being older than we, are wiser, and have not\r\ninvented gunpowder.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment Diana joined in the conversation by a sonorous barking.\r\nShe was asking for her breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Michel Ardan, \"in our discussion we have forgotten\r\nDiana and Satellite.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately a good-sized pie was given to the dog, which\r\ndevoured it hungrily.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see, Barbicane,\" said Michel, \"we should have made a\r\nsecond Noah's ark of this projectile, and borne with us to the\r\nmoon a couple of every kind of domestic animal.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say; but room would have failed us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Michel, \"we might have squeezed a little.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fact is,\" replied Nicholl, \"that cows, bulls, and horses,\r\nand all ruminants, would have been very useful on the lunar\r\ncontinent, but unfortunately the car could neither have been\r\nmade a stable nor a shed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we might have at least brought a donkey, only a little\r\ndonkey; that courageous beast which old Silenus loved to mount.\r\nI love those old donkeys; they are the least favored animals in\r\ncreation; they are not only beaten while alive, but even after\r\nthey are dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you make that out?\" asked Barbicane.  \"Why,\" said\r\nMichel, \"they make their skins into drums.\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane and Nicholl could not help laughing at this ridiculous remark.\r\nBut a cry from their merry companion stopped them.  The latter was\r\nleaning over the spot where Satellite lay.  He rose, saying:\r\n\r\n\"My good Satellite is no longer ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Michel, \"he is dead!  There,\" added he, in a\r\npiteous tone, \"that is embarrassing.  I much fear, my poor\r\nDiana, that you will leave no progeny in the lunar regions!\"\r\n\r\nIndeed the unfortunate Satellite had not survived its wound.\r\nIt was quite dead.  Michel Ardan looked at his friends with a\r\nrueful countenance.\r\n\r\n\"One question presents itself,\" said Barbicane.  \"We cannot keep\r\nthe dead body of this dog with us for the next forty-eight hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! certainly not,\" replied Nicholl; \"but our scuttles are\r\nfixed on hinges; they can be let down.  We will open one, and\r\nthrow the body out into space.\"\r\n\r\nThe president thought for some moments, and then said:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we must do so, but at the same time taking very great precautions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked Michel.\r\n\r\n\"For two reasons which you will understand,\" answered Barbicane.\r\n\"The first relates to the air shut up in the projectile, and of\r\nwhich we must lose as little as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we manufacture the air?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only in part.  We make only the oxygen, my worthy Michel; and\r\nwith regard to that, we must watch that the apparatus does not\r\nfurnish the oxygen in too great a quantity; for an excess would\r\nbring us very serious physiological troubles.  But if we make\r\nthe oxygen, we do not make the azote, that medium which the\r\nlungs do not absorb, and which ought to remain intact; and that\r\nazote will escape rapidly through the open scuttles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! the time for throwing out poor Satellite?\" said Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Agreed; but we must act quickly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the second reason?\" asked Michel.\r\n\r\n\"The second reason is that we must not let the outer cold, which\r\nis excessive, penetrate the projectile or we shall be frozen to death.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the sun?\"\r\n\r\n\"The sun warms our projectile, which absorbs its rays; but it\r\ndoes not warm the vacuum in which we are floating at this moment.\r\nWhere there is no air, there is no more heat than diffused light;\r\nand the same with darkness; it is cold where the sun's rays do not\r\nstrike direct.  This temperature is only the temperature produced\r\nby the radiation of the stars; that is to say, what the\r\nterrestrial globe would undergo if the sun disappeared one day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which is not to be feared,\" replied Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Who knows?\" said Michel Ardan.  \"But, in admitting that the sun\r\ndoes not go out, might it not happen that the earth might move\r\naway from it?\"\r\n\r\n\"There!\" said Barbicane, \"there is Michel with his ideas.\"\r\n\r\n\"And,\" continued Michel, \"do we not know that in 1861 the earth\r\npassed through the tail of a comet?  Or let us suppose a comet\r\nwhose power of attraction is greater than that of the sun.\r\nThe terrestrial orbit will bend toward the wandering star, and\r\nthe earth, becoming its satellite, will be drawn such a distance\r\nthat the rays of the sun will have no action on its surface.\"\r\n\r\n\"That _might_ happen, indeed,\" replied Barbicane, \"but the\r\nconsequences of such a displacement need not be so formidable as\r\nyou suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the heat and cold would be equalized on our globe.\r\nIt has been calculated that, had our earth been carried along in\r\nits course by the comet of 1861, at its perihelion, that is, its\r\nnearest approach to the sun, it would have undergone a heat\r\n28,000 times greater than that of summer.  But this heat, which\r\nis sufficient to evaporate the waters, would have formed a thick\r\nring of cloud, which would have modified that excessive\r\ntemperature; hence the compensation between the cold of the\r\naphelion and the heat of the perihelion.\"\r\n\r\n\"At how many degrees,\" asked Nicholl, \"is the temperature of the\r\nplanetary spaces estimated?\"\r\n\r\n\"Formerly,\" replied Barbicane, \"it was greatly exagerated; but\r\nnow, after the calculations of Fourier, of the French Academy of\r\nScience, it is not supposed to exceed 60@ Centigrade below zero.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pooh!\" said Michel, \"that's nothing!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very much,\" replied Barbicane; \"the temperature which was\r\nobserved in the polar regions, at Melville Island and Fort\r\nReliance, that is 76@ Fahrenheit below zero.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I mistake not,\" said Nicholl, \"M. Pouillet, another savant,\r\nestimates the temperature of space at 250@ Fahrenheit below zero.\r\nWe shall, however, be able to verify these calculations for ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at present; because the solar rays, beating directly\r\nupon our thermometer, would give, on the contrary, a very high\r\ntemperature.  But, when we arrive in the moon, during its\r\nfifteen days of night at either face, we shall have leisure to\r\nmake the experiment, for our satellite lies in a vacuum.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by a vacuum?\" asked Michel.  \"Is it perfectly such?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is absolutely void of air.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is the air replaced by nothing whatever?\"\r\n\r\n\"By the ether only,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"And pray what is the ether?\"\r\n\r\n\"The ether, my friend, is an agglomeration of imponderable\r\natoms, which, relatively to their dimensions, are as far removed\r\nfrom each other as the celestial bodies are in space.  It is\r\nthese atoms which, by their vibratory motion, produce both light\r\nand heat in the universe.\"\r\n\r\nThey now proceeded to the burial of Satellite.  They had merely\r\nto drop him into space, in the same way that sailors drop a body\r\ninto the sea; but, as President Barbicane suggested, they must\r\nact quickly, so as to lose as little as possible of that air\r\nwhose elasticity would rapidly have spread it into space.\r\nThe bolts of the right scuttle, the opening of which measured\r\nabout twelve inches across, were carefully drawn, while Michel,\r\nquite grieved, prepared to launch his dog into space.  The glass,\r\nraised by a powerful lever, which enabled it to overcome the\r\npressure of the inside air on the walls of the projectile,\r\nturned rapidly on its hinges, and Satellite was thrown out.\r\nScarcely a particle of air could have escaped, and the operation\r\nwas so successful that later on Barbicane did not fear to\r\ndispose of the rubbish which encumbered the car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTION AND ANSWER\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of December, when the travelers awoke after\r\nfifty-four hours' journey, the chronometer marked five o'clock\r\nof the terrestrial morning.  In time it was just over five\r\nhours and forty minutes, half of that assigned to their sojourn\r\nin the projectile; but they had already accomplished nearly\r\nseven-tenths of the way.  This peculiarity was due to their\r\nregularly decreasing speed.\r\n\r\nNow when they observed the earth through the lower window,\r\nit looked like nothing more than a dark spot, drowned in the\r\nsolar rays.  No more crescent, no more cloudy light!  The next\r\nday, at midnight, the earth would be _new_, at the very moment\r\nwhen the moon would be full.  Above, the orb of night was nearing\r\nthe line followed by the projectile, so as to meet it at the\r\ngiven hour.  All around the black vault was studded with brilliant\r\npoints, which seemed to move slowly; but, at the great distance\r\nthey were from them, their relative size did not seem to change.\r\nThe sun and stars appeared exactly as they do to us upon earth.\r\nAs to the moon, she was considerably larger; but the travelers'\r\nglasses, not very powerful, did not allow them as yet to make\r\nany useful observations upon her surface, or reconnoiter her\r\ntopographically or geologically.\r\n\r\nThus the time passed in never-ending conversations all about\r\nthe moon.  Each one brought forward his own contingent of\r\nparticular facts; Barbicane and Nicholl always serious, Michel\r\nArdan always enthusiastic.  The projectile, its situation,\r\nits direction, incidents which might happen, the precautions\r\nnecessitated by their fall on to the moon, were inexhaustible\r\nmatters of conjecture.\r\n\r\nAs they were breakfasting, a question of Michel's, relating to\r\nthe projectile, provoked rather a curious answer from Barbicane,\r\nwhich is worth repeating.  Michel, supposing it to be roughly\r\nstopped, while still under its formidable initial speed, wished\r\nto know what the consequences of the stoppage would have been.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Barbicane, \"I do not see how it could have been stopped.\"\r\n\r\n\"But let us suppose so,\" said Michel.\r\n\r\n\"It is an impossible supposition,\" said the practical Barbicane;\r\n\"unless that impulsive force had failed; but even then its speed\r\nwould diminish by degrees, and it would not have stopped suddenly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Admit that it had struck a body in space.\"\r\n\r\n\"What body?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why that enormous meteor which we met.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Nicholl, \"the projectile would have been broken\r\ninto a thousand pieces, and we with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"More than that,\" replied Barbicane; \"we should have been burned\r\nto death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Burned?\" exclaimed Michel, \"by Jove!  I am sorry it did not\r\nhappen, `just to see.'\"\r\n\r\n\"And you would have seen,\" replied Barbicane.  \"It is known now\r\nthat heat is only a modification of motion.  When water is\r\nwarmed-- that is to say, when heat is added to it--its particles\r\nare set in motion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said michel, \"that is an ingenious theory!\"\r\n\r\n\"And a true one, my worthy friend; for it explains every\r\nphenomenon of caloric.  Heat is but the motion of atoms, a\r\nsimple oscillation of the particles of a body.  When they apply\r\nthe brake to a train, the train comes to a stop; but what\r\nbecomes of the motion which it had previously possessed?  It is\r\ntransformed into heat, and the brake becomes hot.  Why do they\r\ngrease the axles of the wheels?  To prevent their heating,\r\nbecause this heat would be generated by the motion which is thus\r\nlost by transformation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I understand,\" replied Michel, \"perfectly.  For example,\r\nwhen I have run a long time, when I am swimming, when I am\r\nperspiring in large drops, why am I obliged to stop?\r\nSimply because my motion is changed into heat.\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane could not help smiling at Michel's reply; then,\r\nreturning to his theory, said:\r\n\r\n\"Thus, in case of a shock, it would have been with our\r\nprojectile as with a ball which falls in a burning state after\r\nhaving struck the metal plate; it is its motion which is turned\r\ninto heat.  Consequently I affirm that, if our projectile had\r\nstruck the meteor, its speed thus suddenly checked would have\r\nraised a heat great enough to turn it into vapor instantaneously.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" asked Nicholl, \"what would happen if the earth's motion\r\nwere to stop suddenly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her temperature would be raised to such a pitch,\" said\r\nBarbicane, \"that she would be at once reduced to vapor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Michel, \"that is a way of ending the earth which\r\nwill greatly simplify things.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if the earth fell upon the sun?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"According to calculation,\" replied Barbicane, \"the fall would\r\ndevelop a heat equal to that produced by 16,000 globes of coal,\r\neach equal in bulk to our terrestrial globe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good additional heat for the sun,\" replied Michel Ardan, \"of\r\nwhich the inhabitants of Uranus or Neptune would doubtless not\r\ncomplain; they must be perished with cold on their planets.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thus, my friends,\" said Barbicane, \"all motion suddenly stopped\r\nproduces heat.  And this theory allows us to infer that the heat\r\nof the solar disc is fed by a hail of meteors falling\r\nincessantly on its surface.  They have even calculated----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear!\" murmured Michel, \"the figures are coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have even calculated,\" continued the imperturbable Barbicane,\r\n\"that the shock of each meteor on the sun ought to produce a heat\r\nequal to that of 4,000 masses of coal of an equal bulk.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is the solar heat?\" asked Michel.\r\n\r\n\"It is equal to that produced by the combustion of a stratum of\r\ncoal surrounding the sun to a depth of forty-seven miles.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that heat----\"\r\n\r\n\"Would be able to boil two billions nine hundred millions of\r\ncubic myriameters [2] of water.\"\r\n\r\n[2] The myriameter is equal to rather more than 10,936\r\ncubic yards English.\r\n\r\n\"And it does not roast us!\" exclaimed Michel.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Barbicane, \"because the terrestrial atmosphere\r\nabsorbs four-tenths of the solar heat; besides, the quantity of\r\nheat intercepted by the earth is but a billionth part of the\r\nentire radiation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see that all is for the best,\" said Michel, \"and that this\r\natmosphere is a useful invention; for it not only allows us to\r\nbreathe, but it prevents us from roasting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" said Nicholl, \"unfortunately, it will not be the same in\r\nthe moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" said Michel, always hopeful.  \"If there are inhabitants,\r\nthey must breathe.  If there are no longer any, they must have\r\nleft enough oxygen for three people, if only at the bottom of\r\nravines, where its own weight will cause it to accumulate, and\r\nwe will not climb the mountains; that is all.\"  And Michel,\r\nrising, went to look at the lunar disc, which shone with\r\nintolerable brilliancy.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" said he, \"it must be hot up there!\"\r\n\r\n\"Without considering,\" replied Nicholl, \"that the day lasts 360 hours!\"\r\n\r\n\"And to compensate that,\" said Barbicane, \"the nights have the\r\nsame length; and as heat is restored by radiation, their\r\ntemperature can only be that of the planetary space.\"\r\n\r\n\"A pretty country, that!\" exclaimed Michel.  \"Never mind!\r\nI wish I was there!  Ah! my dear comrades, it will be rather\r\ncurious to have the earth for our moon, to see it rise on the\r\nhorizon, to recognize the shape of its continents, and to say\r\nto oneself, `There is America, there is Europe;' then to follow\r\nit when it is about to lose itself in the sun's rays!  By the\r\nbye, Barbicane, have the Selenites eclipses?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, eclipses of the sun,\" replied Barbicane, \"when the centers\r\nof the three orbs are on a line, the earth being in the middle.\r\nBut they are only partial, during which the earth, cast like a\r\nscreen upon the solar disc, allows the greater portion to be seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why,\" asked Nicholl, \"is there no total eclipse?  Does not\r\nthe cone of the shadow cast by the earth extend beyond the moon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if we do not take into consideration the refraction\r\nproduced by the terrestrial atmosphere.  No, if we take that\r\nrefraction into consideration.  Thus let <lower case delta> be\r\nthe horizontal parallel, and _p_ the apparent semidiameter----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Michel.  \"Do speak plainly, you man of algebra!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, replied Barbicane; \"in popular language the mean\r\ndistance from the moon to the earth being sixty terrestrial\r\nradii, the length of the cone of the shadow, on account of\r\nrefraction, is reduced to less than forty-two radii.\r\nThe result is that when there are eclipses, the moon finds\r\nitself beyond the cone of pure shadow, and that the sun sends\r\nher its rays, not only from its edges, but also from its center.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Michel, in a merry tone, \"why are there eclipses,\r\nwhen there ought not to be any?\"\r\n\r\n\"Simply because the solar rays are weakened by this refraction,\r\nand the atmosphere through which they pass extinguished the\r\ngreater part of them!\"\r\n\r\n\"That reason satisfies me,\" replied Michel.  \"Besides we shall\r\nsee when we get there.  Now, tell me, Barbicane, do you believe\r\nthat the moon is an old comet?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's an idea!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Michel, with an amiable swagger, \"I have a few\r\nideas of that sort.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that idea does not spring from Michel,\" answered Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, I am a plagiarist.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt about it.  According to the ancients, the Arcadians\r\npretend that their ancestors inhabited the earth before the moon\r\nbecame her satellite.  Starting from this fact, some scientific\r\nmen have seen in the moon a comet whose orbit will one day bring\r\nit so near to the earth that it will be held there by its attraction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there any truth in this hypothesis?\" asked Michel.\r\n\r\n\"None whatever,\" said Barbicane, \"and the proof is, that the\r\nmoon has preserved no trace of the gaseous envelope which always\r\naccompanies comets.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" continued Nicholl, \"Before becoming the earth's satellite,\r\ncould not the moon, when in her perihelion, pass so near the sun\r\nas by evaporation to get rid of all those gaseous substances?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is possible, friend Nicholl, but not probable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because-- Faith I do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Michel, \"what hundred of volumes we might make\r\nof all that we do not know!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! indeed.  What time is it?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Three o'clock,\" answered Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"How time goes,\" said Michel, \"in the conversation of scientific\r\nmen such as we are!  Certainly, I feel I know too much!  I feel\r\nthat I am becoming a well!\"\r\n\r\nSaying which, Michel hoisted himself to the roof of the projectile,\r\n\"to observe the moon better,\" he pretended.  During this time his\r\ncompanions were watching through the lower glass.  Nothing new to note!\r\n\r\nWhen Michel Ardan came down, he went to the side scuttle; and\r\nsuddenly they heard an exclamation of surprise!\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\nThe president approached the window, and saw a sort of flattened\r\nsack floating some yards from the projectile.  This object\r\nseemed as motionless as the projectile, and was consequently\r\nanimated with the same ascending movement.\r\n\r\n\"What is that machine?\" continued Michel Ardan.  \"Is it one of\r\nthe bodies which our projectile keeps within its attraction, and\r\nwhich will accompany it to the moon?\"\r\n\r\n\"What astonishes me,\" said Nicholl, \"is that the specific weight\r\nof the body, which is certainly less than that of the\r\nprojectile, allows it to keep so perfectly on a level with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nicholl,\" replied Barbicane, after a moment's reflection, \"I do\r\nnot know what the object it, but I do know why it maintains our level.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because we are floating in space, my dear captain, and in space\r\nbodies fall or move (which is the same thing) with equal speed\r\nwhatever be their weight or form; it is the air, which by its\r\nresistance creates these differences in weight.  When you create\r\na vacuum in a tube, the objects you send through it, grains of\r\ndust or grains of lead, fall with the same rapidity.  Here in\r\nspace is the same cause and the same effect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" said Nicholl, \"and everything we throw out of the\r\nprojectile will accompany it until it reaches the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! fools that we are!\" exclaimed Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Why that expletive?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Because we might have filled the projectile with useful objects,\r\nbooks, instruments, tools, etc.  We could have thrown them all\r\nout, and all would have followed in our train.  But happy thought!\r\nWhy cannot we walk outside like the meteor?  Why cannot we launch\r\ninto space through the scuttle?  What enjoyment it would be to\r\nfeel oneself thus suspended in ether, more favored than the birds\r\nwho must use their wings to keep themselves up!\"\r\n\r\n\"Granted,\" said Barbicane, \"but how to breathe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hang the air, to fail so inopportunely!\"\r\n\r\n\"But if it did not fail, Michel, your density being less than\r\nthat of the projectile, you would soon be left behind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we must remain in our car?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Michel, in a load voice.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter,\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"I know, I guess, what this pretended meteor is!  It is no\r\nasteroid which is accompanying us!  It is not a piece of a planet.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it then?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"It is our unfortunate dog!  It is Diana's husband!\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, this deformed, unrecognizable object, reduced to\r\nnothing, was the body of Satellite, flattened like a bagpipe\r\nwithout wind, and ever mounting, mounting!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nA MOMENT OF INTOXICATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThus a phenomenon, curious but explicable, was happening under\r\nthese strange conditions.\r\n\r\nEvery object thrown from the projectile would follow the same\r\ncourse and never stop until it did.  There was a subject for\r\nconversation which the whole evening could not exhaust.\r\n\r\nBesides, the excitement of the three travelers increased as they\r\ndrew near the end of their journey.  They expected unforseen\r\nincidents, and new phenomena; and nothing would have astonished\r\nthem in the frame of mind they then were in.  Their overexcited\r\nimagination went faster than the projectile, whose speed was\r\nevidently diminishing, though insensibly to themselves.  But the\r\nmoon grew larger to their eyes, and they fancied if they\r\nstretched out their hands they could seize it.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 5th of November, at five in the morning,\r\nall three were on foot.  That day was to be the last of their\r\njourney, if all calculations were true.  That very night, at\r\ntwelve o'clock, in eighteen hours, exactly at the full moon,\r\nthey would reach its brilliant disc.  The next midnight would\r\nsee that journey ended, the most extraordinary of ancient or\r\nmodern times.  Thus from the first of the morning, through the\r\nscuttles silvered by its rays, they saluted the orb of night\r\nwith a confident and joyous hurrah.\r\n\r\nThe moon was advancing majestically along the starry firmament.\r\nA few more degrees, and she would reach the exact point where\r\nher meeting with the projectile was to take place.\r\n\r\nAccording to his own observations, Barbicane reckoned that they\r\nwould land on her northern hemisphere, where stretch immense plains,\r\nand where mountains are rare.  A favorable circumstance if, as\r\nthey thought, the lunar atmosphere was stored only in its depths.\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" observed Michel Ardan, \"a plain is easier to\r\ndisembark upon than a mountain.  A Selenite, deposited in Europe\r\non the summit of Mont Blanc, or in  Asia on the top of the\r\nHimalayas, would not be quite in the right place.\"\r\n\r\n\"And,\" added Captain Nicholl, \"on a flat ground, the projectile\r\nwill remain motionless when it has once touched; whereas on a\r\ndeclivity it would roll like an avalanche, and not being\r\nsquirrels we should not come out safe and sound.  So it is all\r\nfor the best.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, the success of the audacious attempt no longer\r\nappeared doubtful.  But Barbicane was preoccupied with one\r\nthought; but not wishing to make his companions uneasy, he\r\nkept silence on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe direction the projectile was taking toward the moon's\r\nnorthern hemisphere, showed that her course had been\r\nslightly altered.  The discharge, mathematically calculated,\r\nwould carry the projectile to the very center of the lunar disc.\r\nIf it did not land there, there must have been some deviation.\r\nWhat had caused it?  Barbicane could neither imagine nor\r\ndetermine the importance of the deviation, for there were no\r\npoints to go by.\r\n\r\nHe hoped, however, that it would have no other result than that\r\nof bringing them nearer the upper border of the moon, a region\r\nmore suitable for landing.\r\n\r\nWithout imparting his uneasiness to his companions, Barbicane\r\ncontented himself with constantly observing the moon, in order\r\nto see whether the course of the projectile would not be\r\naltered; for the situation would have been terrible if it failed\r\nin its aim, and being carried beyond the disc should be launched\r\ninto interplanetary space.  At that moment, the moon, instead of\r\nappearing flat like a disc, showed its convexity.  If the sun's\r\nrays had struck it obliquely, the shadow thrown would have brought\r\nout the high mountains, which would have been clearly detached.\r\nThe eye might have gazed into the crater's gaping abysses,\r\nand followed the capricious fissures which wound through the\r\nimmense plains.  But all relief was as yet leveled in\r\nintense brilliancy.  They could scarcely distinguish those\r\nlarge spots which give the moon the appearance of a human face.\r\n\r\n\"Face, indeed!\" said Michel Ardan; \"but I am sorry for the\r\namiable sister of Apollo.  A very pitted face!\"\r\n\r\nBut the travelers, now so near the end, were incessantly\r\nobserving this new world.  They imagined themselves walking\r\nthrough its unknown countries, climbing its highest peaks,\r\ndescending into its lowest depths.  Here and there they fancied\r\nthey saw vast seas, scarcely kept together under so rarefied an\r\natmosphere, and water-courses emptying the mountain tributaries.\r\nLeaning over the abyss, they hoped to catch some sounds from\r\nthat orb forever mute in the solitude of space.  That last day\r\nleft them.\r\n\r\nThey took down the most trifling details.  A vague uneasiness\r\ntook possession of them as they neared the end.  This uneasiness\r\nwould have been doubled had they felt how their speed had decreased.\r\nIt would have seemed to them quite insufficient to carry them to\r\nthe end.  It was because the projectile then \"weighed\" almost nothing.\r\nIts weight was ever decreasing, and would be entirely annihilated on\r\nthat line where the lunar and terrestrial attractions would\r\nneutralize each other.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of his preoccupation, Michel Ardan did not forget\r\nto prepare the morning repast with his accustomed punctuality.\r\nThey ate with a good appetite.  Nothing was so excellent as the\r\nsoup liquefied by the heat of the gas; nothing better than the\r\npreserved meat.  Some glasses of good French wine crowned the\r\nrepast, causing Michel Ardan to remark that the lunar vines,\r\nwarmed by that ardent sun, ought to distill even more generous\r\nwines; that is, if they existed.  In any case, the far-seeing\r\nFrenchman had taken care not to forget in his collection some\r\nprecious cuttings of the Medoc and Cote d'Or, upon which he\r\nfounded his hopes.\r\n\r\nReiset and Regnaut's apparatus worked with great regularity.\r\nNot an atom of carbonic acid resisted the potash; and as to\r\nthe oxygen, Captain Nicholl said \"it was of the first quality.\"\r\nThe little watery vapor enclosed in the projectile mixing with\r\nthe air tempered the dryness; and many apartments in London,\r\nParis, or New York, and many theaters, were certainly not in\r\nsuch a healthy condition.\r\n\r\nBut that it might act with regularity, the apparatus must be\r\nkept in perfect order; so each morning Michel visited the escape\r\nregulators, tried the taps, and regulated the heat of the gas by\r\nthe pyrometer.  Everything had gone well up to that time, and\r\nthe travelers, imitating the worthy Joseph T. Maston, began to\r\nacquire a degree of embonpoint which would have rendered them\r\nunrecognizable if their imprisonment had been prolonged to\r\nsome months.  In a word, they behaved like chickens in a coop;\r\nthey were getting fat.\r\n\r\nIn looking through the scuttle Barbicane saw the specter of the\r\ndog, and other divers objects which had been thrown from the\r\nprojectile, obstinately following them.  Diana howled\r\nlugubriously on seeing the remains of Satellite, which seemed as\r\nmotionless as if they reposed on solid earth.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, my friends,\" said Michel Ardan, \"that if one of us\r\nhad succumbed to the shock consequent on departure, we should\r\nhave had a great deal of trouble to bury him?  What am I saying?\r\nto _etherize_ him, as here ether takes the place of earth.\r\nYou see the accusing body would have followed us into space like\r\na remorse.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would have been sad,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" continued Michel, \"what I regret is not being able to take a\r\nwalk outside.  What voluptuousness to float amid this radiant ether,\r\nto bathe oneself in it, to wrap oneself in the sun's pure rays.\r\nIf Barbicane had only thought of furnishing us with a diving\r\napparatus and an air-pump, I could have ventured out and assumed\r\nfanciful attitudes of feigned monsters on the top of the projectile.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, old Michel,\" replied Barbicane, \"you would not have made\r\na feigned monster long, for in spite of your diver's dress, swollen\r\nby the expansion of air within you, you would have burst like a\r\nshell, or rather like a balloon which has risen too high.  So do\r\nnot regret it, and do not forget this-- as long as we float in\r\nspace, all sentimental walks beyond the projectile are forbidden.\"\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan allowed himself to be convinced to a certain extent.\r\nHe admitted that the thing was difficult but not impossible,\r\na word which he never uttered.\r\n\r\nThe conversation passed from this subject to another, not failing\r\nhim for an instant.  It seemed to the three friends as though,\r\nunder present conditions, ideas shot up in their brains as leaves\r\nshoot at the first warmth of spring.  They felt bewildered.  In the\r\nmiddle of the questions and answers which crossed each other,\r\nNicholl put one question which did not find an immediate solution.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, indeed!\" said he; \"it is all very well to go to the moon,\r\nbut how to get back again?\"\r\n\r\nHis two interlocutors looked surprised.  One would have thought\r\nthat this possibility now occurred to them for the first time.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by that, Nicholl?\" asked Barbicane gravely.\r\n\r\n\"To ask for means to leave a country,\" added Michel, \"When we\r\nhave not yet arrived there, seems to me rather inopportune.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not say that, wishing to draw back,\" replied Nicholl;\r\n\"but I repeat my question, and I ask, `How shall we return?'\"\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing about it,\" answered Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" said Michel, \"if I had known how to return, I would\r\nnever have started.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's an answer!\" cried Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"I quite approve of Michel's words,\" said Barbicane; \"and add,\r\nthat the question has no real interest.  Later, when we think it\r\nis advisable to return, we will take counsel together.  If the\r\nColumbiad is not there, the projectile will be.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a step certainly.  A ball without a gun!\"\r\n\r\n\"The gun,\" replied Barbicane, \"can be manufactured.  The powder\r\ncan be made.  Neither metals, saltpeter, nor coal can fail in\r\nthe depths of the moon, and we need only go 8,000 leagues in\r\norder to fall upon the terrestrial globe by virtue of the mere\r\nlaws of weight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough,\" said Michel with animation.  \"Let it be no longer a\r\nquestion of returning: we have already entertained it too long.\r\nAs to communicating with our former earthly colleagues, that\r\nwill not be difficult.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how?\"\r\n\r\n\"By means of meteors launched by lunar volcanoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well thought of, Michel,\" said Barbicane in a convinced tone\r\nof voice.  \"Laplace has calculated that a force five times greater\r\nthan that of our gun would suffice to send a meteor from the\r\nmoon to the earth, and there is not one volcano which has not a\r\ngreater power of propulsion than that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" exclaimed Michel; \"these meteors are handy postmen,\r\nand cost nothing.  And how we shall be able to laugh at the\r\npost-office administration!  But now I think of it----\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of?\"\r\n\r\n\"A capital idea.  Why did we not fasten a thread to our\r\nprojectile, and we could have exchanged telegrams with the earth?\"\r\n\r\n\"The deuce!\" answered Nicholl.  \"Do you consider the weight of\r\na thread 250,000 miles long nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"As nothing.  They could have trebled the Columbiad's charge;\r\nthey could have quadrupled or quintupled it!\" exclaimed Michel,\r\nwith whom the verb took a higher intonation each time.\r\n\r\n\"There is but one little objection to make to your proposition,\"\r\nreplied Barbicane, \"which is that, during the rotary motion of\r\nthe globe, our thread would have wound itself round it like a\r\nchain on a capstan, and that it would inevitably have brought us\r\nto the ground.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the thirty-nine stars of the Union!\" said Michel, \"I have\r\nnothing but impracticable ideas to-day; ideas worthy of J.\r\nT. Maston.  But I have a notion that, if we do not return to\r\nearth, J. T. Maston will be able to come to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he'll come,\" replied Barbicane; \"he is a worthy and a\r\ncourageous comrade.  Besides, what is easier?  Is not the\r\nColumbiad still buried in the soil of Florida?  Is cotton and\r\nnitric acid wanted wherewith to manufacture the pyroxyle?\r\nWill not the moon pass the zenith of Florida?  In eighteen\r\nyears' time will she not occupy exactly the same place as to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" continued Michel, \"yes, Maston will come, and with him\r\nour friends Elphinstone, Blomsberry, all the members of the Gun\r\nClub, and they will be well received.  And by and by they will\r\nrun trains of projectiles between the earth and the moon!\r\nHurrah for J. T. Maston!\"\r\n\r\nIt is probable that, if the Hon. J. T. Maston did not hear the\r\nhurrahs uttered in his honor, his ears at least tingled.  What was\r\nhe doing then?  Doubtless, posted in the Rocky Mountains, at the\r\nstation of Long's Peak, he was trying to find the invisible\r\nprojectile gravitating in space.  If he was thinking of his dear\r\ncompanions, we must allow that they were not far behind him; and\r\nthat, under the influence of a strange excitement, they were\r\ndevoting to him their best thoughts.\r\n\r\nBut whence this excitement, which was evidently growing upon the\r\ntenants of the projectile?  Their sobriety could not be doubted.\r\nThis strange irritation of the brain, must it be attributed to\r\nthe peculiar circumstances under which they found themselves, to\r\ntheir proximity to the orb of night, from which only a few hours\r\nseparated them, to some secret influence of the moon acting upon\r\ntheir nervous system?  Their faces were as rosy as if they had\r\nbeen exposed to the roaring flames of an oven; their voices\r\nresounded in loud accents; their words escaped like a champagne\r\ncork driven out by carbonic acid; their gestures became annoying,\r\nthey wanted so much room to perform them; and, strange to say,\r\nthey none of them noticed this great tension of the mind.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Nicholl, in a short tone, \"now that I do not know\r\nwhether we shall ever return from the moon, I want to know what\r\nwe are going to do there?\"\r\n\r\n\"What we are going to do there?\" replied Barbicane, stamping\r\nwith his foot as if he was in a fencing saloon; \"I do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not know!\" exclaimed Michel, with a bellow which\r\nprovoked a sonorous echo in the projectile.\r\n\r\n\"No, I have not even thought about it,\" retorted Barbicane, in\r\nthe same loud tone.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I know,\" replied Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Speak, then,\" cried Nicholl, who could no longer contain the\r\ngrowling of his voice.\r\n\r\n\"I shall speak if it suits me,\" exclaimed Michel, seizing his\r\ncompanions' arms with violence.\r\n\r\n\"_It must_ suit you,\" said Barbicane, with an eye on fire and a\r\nthreatening hand.  \"It was you who drew us into this frightful\r\njourney, and we want to know what for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the captain, \"now that I do not know _where_ I am\r\ngoing, I want to know _why_ I am going.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" exclaimed Michel, jumping a yard high, \"why?  To take\r\npossession of the moon in the name of the United States; to add\r\na fortieth State to the Union; to colonize the lunar regions;\r\nto cultivate them, to people them, to transport thither all the\r\nprodigies of art, of science, and industry; to civilize the\r\nSelenites, unless they are more civilized than we are; and to\r\nconstitute them a republic, if they are not already one!\"\r\n\r\n\"And if there are no Selenites?\" retorted Nicholl, who, under the\r\ninfluence of this unaccountable intoxication, was very contradictory.\r\n\r\n\"Who said that there were no Selenites?\" exclaimed Michel in a\r\nthreatening tone.\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" howled Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Captain,\" said Michel, \"do not repreat that insolence, or I\r\nwill knock your teeth down your throat!\"\r\n\r\nThe two adversaries were going to fall upon each other, and the\r\nincoherent discussion threatened to merge into a fight, when\r\nBarbicane intervened with one bound.\r\n\r\n\"Stop, miserable men,\" said he, separating his two companions;\r\n\"if there are no Selenites, we will do without them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" exclaimed Michel, who was not particular; \"yes, we will\r\ndo without them.  We have only to make Selenites.  Down with\r\nthe Selenites!\"\r\n\r\n\"The empire of the moon belongs to us,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Let us three constitute the republic.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will be the congress,\" cried Michel.\r\n\r\n\"And I the senate,\" retorted Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"And Barbicane, the president,\" howled Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Not a president elected by the nation,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, a president elected by the congress,\" cried Michel;\r\n\"and as I am the congress, you are unanimously elected!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! for President Barbicane,\" exclaimed Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Hip! hip! hip!\" vociferated Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\nThen the president and the senate struck up in a tremendous\r\nvoice the popular song \"Yankee Doodle,\" while from the congress\r\nresounded the masculine tones of the \"Marseillaise.\"\r\n\r\nThen they struck up a frantic dance, with maniacal gestures,\r\nidiotic stampings, and somersaults like those of the boneless\r\nclowns in the circus.  Diana, joining in the dance, and howling\r\nin her turn, jumped to the top of the projectile.  An unaccountable\r\nflapping of wings was then heard amid most fantastic cock-crows,\r\nwhile five or six hens fluttered like bats against the walls.\r\n\r\nThen the three traveling companions, acted upon by some\r\nunaccountable influence above that of intoxication, inflamed by\r\nthe air which had set their respiratory apparatus on fire, fell\r\nmotionless to the bottom of the projectile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAT SEVENTY-EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN LEAGUES\r\n\r\nWhat had happened?  Whence the cause of this singular\r\nintoxication, the consequences of which might have been\r\nvery disastrous?  A simple blunder of Michel's, which,\r\nfortunately, Nicholl was able to correct in time.\r\n\r\nAfter a perfect swoon, which lasted some minutes, the captain,\r\nrecovering first, soon collected his scattered senses.\r\nAlthough he had breakfasted only two hours before, he felt a\r\ngnawing hunger, as if he had not eaten anything for several days.\r\nEverything about him, stomach and brain, were overexcited to the\r\nhighest degree.  He got up and demanded from Michel a\r\nsupplementary repast.  Michel, utterly done up, did not answer.\r\n\r\nNicholl then tried to prepare some tea destined to help the\r\nabsorption of a dozen sandwiches.  He first tried to get some\r\nfire, and struck a match sharply.  What was his surprise to see\r\nthe sulphur shine with so extraordinary a brilliancy as to be\r\nalmost unbearable to the eye.  From the gas-burner which he lit\r\nrose a flame equal to a jet of electric light.\r\n\r\nA revelation dawned on Nicholl's mind.  That intensity of light,\r\nthe physiological troubles which had arisen in him, the\r\noverexcitement of all his moral and quarrelsome faculties-- he\r\nunderstood all.\r\n\r\n\"The oxygen!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nAnd leaning over the air apparatus, he saw that the tap was\r\nallowing the colorless gas to escape freely, life-giving, but in\r\nits pure state producing the gravest disorders in the system.\r\nMichel had blunderingly opened the tap of the apparatus to the full.\r\n\r\nNicholl hastened to stop the escape of oxygen with which the\r\natmosphere was saturated, which would have been the death of the\r\ntravelers, not by suffocation, but by combustion.  An hour\r\nlater, the air less charged with it restored the lungs to their\r\nnormal condition.  By degrees the three friends recovered from\r\ntheir intoxication; but they were obliged to sleep themselves\r\nsober over their oxygen as a drunkard does over his wine.\r\n\r\nWhen Michel learned his share of the responsibility of this\r\nincident, he was not much disconcerted.  This unexpected\r\ndrunkenness broke the monotony of the journey.  Many foolish\r\nthings had been said while under its influence, but also\r\nquickly forgotten.\r\n\r\n\"And then,\" added the merry Frenchman, \"I am not sorry to have\r\ntasted a little of this heady gas.  Do you know, my friends,\r\nthat a curious establishment might be founded with rooms of\r\noxygen, where people whose system is weakened could for a few\r\nhours live a more active life.  Fancy parties where the room was\r\nsaturated with this heroic fluid, theaters where it should be\r\nkept at high pressure; what passion in the souls of the actors\r\nand spectators! what fire, what enthusiasm!  And if, instead of\r\nan assembly only a whole people could be saturated, what activity\r\nin its functions, what a supplement to life it would derive.\r\nFrom an exhausted nation they might make a great and strong one,\r\nand I know more than one state in old Europe which ought to put\r\nitself under the regime of oxygen for the sake of its health!\"\r\n\r\nMichel spoke with so much animation that one might have fancied\r\nthat the tap was still too open.  But a few words from Barbicane\r\nsoon shattered his enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"That is all very well, friend Michel,\" said he, \"but will you\r\ninform us where these chickens came from which have mixed\r\nthemselves up in our concert?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those chickens?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, half a dozen chickens and a fine cock were walking\r\nabout, flapping their wings and chattering.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, the awkward things!\" exclaimed Michel.  \"The oxygen has\r\nmade them revolt.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what do you want to do with these chickens?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"To acclimatize them in the moon, by Jove!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why did you hide them?\"\r\n\r\n\"A joke, my worthy president, a simple joke, which has proved a\r\nmiserable failure.  I wanted to set them free on the lunar\r\ncontinent, without saying anything.  Oh, what would have been\r\nyour amazement on seeing these earthly-winged animals pecking in\r\nyour lunar fields!\"\r\n\r\n\"You rascal, you unmitigated rascal,\" replied Barbicane, \"you do\r\nnot want oxygen to mount to the head.  You are always what we\r\nwere under the influence of the gas; you are always foolish!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, who says that we were not wise then?\" replied Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\nAfter this philosophical reflection, the three friends set about\r\nrestoring the order of the projectile.  Chickens and cock were\r\nreinstated in their coop.  But while proceeding with this\r\noperation, Barbicane and his two companions had a most desired\r\nperception of a new phenomenon.  From the moment of leaving the\r\nearth, their own weight, that of the projectile, and the objects\r\nit enclosed, had been subject to an increasing diminution.  If they\r\ncould not prove this loss of the projectile, a moment would arrive\r\nwhen it would be sensibly felt upon themselves and the utensils\r\nand instruments they used.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that a scale would not show this loss; for\r\nthe weight destined to weight the object would have lost exactly\r\nas much as the object itself; but a spring steelyard for\r\nexample, the tension of which was independent of the attraction,\r\nwould have given a just estimate of this loss.\r\n\r\nWe know that the attraction, otherwise called the weight, is in\r\nproportion to the densities of the bodies, and inversely as the\r\nsquares of the distances.  Hence this effect:  If the earth had\r\nbeen alone in space, if the other celestial bodies had been\r\nsuddenly annihilated, the projectile, according to Newton's\r\nlaws, would weigh less as it got farther from the earth, but\r\nwithout ever losing its weight entirely, for the terrestrial\r\nattraction would always have made itself felt, at whatever distance.\r\n\r\nBut, in reality, a time must come when the projectile would no\r\nlonger be subject to the law of weight, after allowing for the\r\nother celestial bodies whose effect could not be set down as zero.\r\nIndeed, the projectile's course was being traced between\r\nthe earth and the moon.  As it distanced the earth, the\r\nterrestrial attraction diminished: but the lunar attraction\r\nrose in proportion.  There must come a point where these two\r\nattractions would neutralize each other:  the projectile would\r\npossess weight no longer.  If the moon's and the earth's\r\ndensities had been equal, this point would have been at an equal\r\ndistance between the two orbs.  But taking the different\r\ndensities into consideration, it was easy to reckon that this\r\npoint would be situated at 47/60ths of the whole journey,\r\n_i.e._, at 78,514 leagues from the earth.  At this point, a body\r\nhaving no principle of speed or displacement in itself, would\r\nremain immovable forever, being attracted equally by both orbs,\r\nand not being drawn more toward one than toward the other.\r\n\r\nNow if the projectile's impulsive force had been correctly\r\ncalculated, it would attain this point without speed, having\r\nlost all trace of weight, as well as all the objects within it.\r\nWhat would happen then?  Three hypotheses presented themselves.\r\n\r\n1. Either it would retain a certain amount of motion, and pass\r\nthe point of equal attraction, and fall upon the moon by virtue\r\nof the excess of the lunar attraction over the terrestrial.\r\n\r\n2. Or, its speed failing, and unable to reach the point of equal\r\nattraction, it would fall upon the moon by virtue of the excess\r\nof the lunar attraction over the terrestrial.\r\n\r\n3. Or, lastly, animated with sufficient speed to enable it to\r\nreach the neutral point, but not sufficient to pass it, it would\r\nremain forever suspended in that spot like the pretended tomb of\r\nMahomet, between the zenith and the nadir.\r\n\r\nSuch was their situation; and Barbicane clearly explained the\r\nconsequences to his traveling companions, which greatly\r\ninterested them.  But how should they know when the projectile\r\nhad reached this neutral point situated at that distance,\r\nespecially when neither themselves, nor the objects enclosed in\r\nthe projectile, would be any longer subject to the laws of weight?\r\n\r\nUp to this time, the travelers, while admitting that this action\r\nwas constantly decreasing, had not yet become sensible to its\r\ntotal absence.\r\n\r\nBut that day, about eleven o'clock in the morning, Nicholl\r\nhaving accidentally let a glass slip from his hand, the glass,\r\ninstead of falling, remained suspended in the air.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, \"that is rather an amusing piece\r\nof natural philosophy.\"\r\n\r\nAnd immediately divers other objects, firearms and bottles,\r\nabandoned to themselves, held themselves up as by enchantment.\r\nDiana too, placed in space by Michel, reproduced, but without\r\nany trick, the wonderful suspension practiced by Caston and\r\nRobert Houdin.  Indeed the dog did not seem to know that she was\r\nfloating in air.\r\n\r\nThe three adventurous companions were surprised and stupefied,\r\ndespite their scientific reasonings.  They felt themselves being\r\ncarried into the domain of wonders! they felt that weight was\r\nreally wanting to their bodies.  If they stretched out their\r\narms, they did not attempt to fall.  Their heads shook on\r\ntheir shoulders.  Their feet no longer clung to the floor of\r\nthe projectile.  They were like drunken men having no stability\r\nin themselves.\r\n\r\nFancy has depicted men without reflection, others without shadow.\r\nBut here reality, by the neutralizations of attractive forces,\r\nproduced men in whom nothing had any weight, and who weighed\r\nnothing themselves.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Michel, taking a spring, left the floor and remained\r\nsuspended in the air, like Murillo's monk of the _Cusine des Anges_.\r\n\r\nThe two friends joined him instantly, and all three formed a\r\nmiraculous \"Ascension\" in the center of the projectile.\r\n\r\n\"Is it to be believed? is it probable? is it possible?\"\r\nexclaimed Michel; \"and yet it is so.  Ah! if Raphael had seen us\r\nthus, what an `Assumption' he would have thrown upon canvas!\"\r\n\r\n\"The `Assumption' cannot last,\" replied Barbicane.  \"If the\r\nprojectile passes the neutral point, the lunar attraction will\r\ndraw us to the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then our feet will be upon the roof,\" replied Michel.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Barbicane, \"because the projectile's center of\r\ngravity is very low; it will only turn by degrees.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then all our portables will be upset from top to bottom, that\r\nis a fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"Calm yourself, Michel,\" replied Nicholl; \"no upset is to be\r\nfeared; not a thing will move, for the projectile's evolution\r\nwill be imperceptible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" continued Barbicane; \"and when it has passed the\r\npoint of equal attraction, its base, being the heavier, will\r\ndraw it perpendicularly to the moon; but, in order that this\r\nphenomenon should take place, we must have passed the neutral line.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pass the neutral line,\" cried Michel; \"then let us do as the\r\nsailors do when they cross the equator.\"\r\n\r\nA slight side movement brought Michel back toward the padded\r\nside; thence he took a bottle and glasses, placed them \"in\r\nspace\" before his companions, and, drinking merrily, they\r\nsaluted the line with a triple hurrah.  The influence of these\r\nattractions scarcely lasted an hour; the travelers felt\r\nthemselves insensibly drawn toward the floor, and Barbicane\r\nfancied that the conical end of the projectile was varying a\r\nlittle from its normal direction toward the moon.  By an inverse\r\nmotion the base was approaching first; the lunar attraction was\r\nprevailing over the terrestrial; the fall toward the moon was\r\nbeginning, almost imperceptibly as yet, but by degrees the\r\nattractive force would become stronger, the fall would be more\r\ndecided, the projectile, drawn by its base, would turn its cone\r\nto the earth, and fall with ever-increasing speed on to the\r\nsurface of the Selenite continent; their destination would then\r\nbe attained.  Now nothing could prevent the success of their\r\nenterprise, and Nicholl and Michel Ardan shared Barbicane's joy.\r\n\r\nThen they chatted of all the phenomena which had astonished them\r\none after the other, particularly the neutralization of the laws\r\nof weight.  Michel Ardan, always enthusiastic, drew conclusions\r\nwhich were purely fanciful.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, my worthy friends,\" he exclaimed, \"what progress we should\r\nmake if on earth we could throw off some of that weight, some of\r\nthat chain which binds us to her; it would be the prisoner set\r\nat liberty; no more fatigue of either arms or legs.  Or, if it\r\nis true that in order to fly on the earth's surface, to keep\r\noneself suspended in the air merely by the play of the muscles,\r\nthere requires a strength a hundred and fifty times greater than\r\nthat which we possess, a simple act of volition, a caprice,\r\nwould bear us into space, if attraction did not exist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" said Nicholl, smiling; \"if we could succeed in\r\nsuppressing weight as they suppress pain by anaesthesia,\r\nthat would change the face of modern society!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" cried Michel, full of his subject, \"destroy weight, and\r\nno more burdens!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well said,\" replied Barbicane; \"but if nothing had any weight,\r\nnothing would keep in its place, not even your hat on your head,\r\nworthy Michel; nor your house, whose stones only adhere by\r\nweight; nor a boat, whose stability on the waves is only caused\r\nby weight; not even the ocean, whose waves would no longer be\r\nequalized by terrestrial attraction; and lastly, not even the\r\natmosphere, whose atoms, being no longer held in their places,\r\nwould disperse in space!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is tiresome,\" retorted Michel; \"nothing like these\r\nmatter-of-fact people for bringing one back to the bare reality.\"\r\n\r\n\"But console yourself, Michel,\" continued Barbicane, \"for if no\r\norb exists from whence all laws of weight are banished, you are\r\nat least going to visit one where it is much less than on the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"The moon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the moon, on whose surface objects weigh six times less\r\nthan on the earth, a phenomenon easy to prove.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we shall feel it?\" asked Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Evidently, as two hundred pounds will only weigh thirty pounds\r\non the surface of the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"And our muscular strength will not diminish?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all; instead of jumping one yard high, you will rise\r\neighteen feet high.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we shall be regular Herculeses in the moon!\" exclaimed Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Nicholl; \"for if the height of the Selenites is\r\nin proportion to the density of their globe, they will be\r\nscarcely a foot high.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lilliputians!\" ejaculated Michel; \"I shall play the part\r\nof Gulliver.  We are going to realize the fable of the giants.\r\nThis is the advantage of leaving one's own planet and\r\nover-running the solar world.\"\r\n\r\n\"One moment, Michel,\" answered Barbicane; \"if you wish to play\r\nthe part of Gulliver, only visit the inferior planets, such as\r\nMercury, Venus, or Mars, whose density is a little less than\r\nthat of the earth; but do not venture into the great planets,\r\nJupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune; for there the order will be\r\nchanged, and you will become Lilliputian.\"\r\n\r\n\"And in the sun?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the sun, if its density is thirteen hundred and twenty-four\r\nthousand times greater, and the attraction is twenty-seven times\r\ngreater than on the surface of our globe, keeping everything in\r\nproportion, the inhabitants ought to be at least two hundred\r\nfeet high.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" exclaimed Michel; \"I should be nothing more than a\r\npigmy, a shrimp!\"\r\n\r\n\"Gulliver with the giants,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"And it would not be quite useless to carry some pieces of\r\nartillery to defend oneself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" replied Nicholl; \"your projectiles would have no effect\r\non the sun; they would fall back upon the earth after some minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a strong remark.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is certain,\" replied Barbicane; \"the attraction is so great\r\non this enormous orb, that an object weighing 70,000 pounds on\r\nthe earth would weigh but 1,920 pounds on the surface of the sun.\r\nIf you were to fall upon it you would weigh-- let me see-- about\r\n5,000 pounds, a weight which you would never be able to raise again.\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil!\" said Michel; \"one would want a portable crane.\r\nHowever, we will be satisfied with the moon for the present;\r\nthere at least we shall cut a great figure.  We will see about\r\nthe sun by and by.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSEQUENCES OF A DEVIATION\r\n\r\n\r\nBarbicane had now no fear of the issue of the journey, at least\r\nas far as the projectile's impulsive force was concerned; its\r\nown speed would carry it beyond the neutral line; it would\r\ncertainly not return to earth; it would certainly not remain\r\nmotionless on the line of attraction.  One single hypothesis\r\nremained to be realized, the arrival of the projectile at its\r\ndestination by the action of the lunar attraction.\r\n\r\nIt was in reality a fall of 8,296 leagues on an orb, it is true,\r\nwhere weight could only be reckoned at one sixth of terrestrial\r\nweight; a formidable fall, nevertheless, and one against which\r\nevery precaution must be taken without delay.\r\n\r\nThese precautions were of two sorts, some to deaden the shock\r\nwhen the projectile should touch the lunar soil, others to delay\r\nthe fall, and consequently make it less violent.\r\n\r\nTo deaden the shock, it was a pity that Barbicane was no longer\r\nable to employ the means which had so ably weakened the shock at\r\ndeparture, that is to say, by water used as springs and the\r\npartition breaks.\r\n\r\nThe partitions still existed, but water failed, for they could\r\nnot use their reserve, which was precious, in case during the\r\nfirst days the liquid element should be found wanting on lunar soil.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed this reserve would have been quite insufficient for\r\na spring.  The layer of water stored in the projectile at\r\nthe time of starting upon their journey occupied no less than\r\nthree feet in depth, and spread over a surface of not less than\r\nfifty-four square feet.  Besides, the cistern did not contain\r\none-fifth part of it; they must therefore give up this efficient\r\nmeans of deadening the shock of arrival.  Happily, Barbicane,\r\nnot content with employing water, had furnished the movable disc\r\nwith strong spring plugs, destined to lessen the shock against\r\nthe base after the breaking of the horizontal partitions.\r\nThese plugs still existed; they had only to readjust them and\r\nreplace the movable disc; every piece, easy to handle, as their\r\nweight was now scarcely felt, was quickly mounted.\r\n\r\nThe different pieces were fitted without trouble, it being only\r\na matter of bolts and screws; tools were not wanting, and soon\r\nthe reinstated disc lay on steel plugs, like a table on its legs.\r\nOne inconvenience resulted from the replacing of the disc,\r\nthe lower window was blocked up; thus it was impossible for\r\nthe travelers to observe the moon from that opening while\r\nthey were being precipitated perpendicularly upon her; but they\r\nwere obliged to give it up; even by the side openings they could\r\nstill see vast lunar regions, as an aeronaut sees the earth from\r\nhis car.\r\n\r\nThis replacing of the disc was at least an hour's work.  It was\r\npast twelve when all preparations were finished.  Barbicane took\r\nfresh observations on the inclination of the projectile, but to\r\nhis annoyance it had not turned over sufficiently for its fall;\r\nit seemed to take a curve parallel to the lunar disc.  The orb\r\nof night shone splendidly into space, while opposite, the orb of\r\nday blazed with fire.\r\n\r\nTheir situation began to make them uneasy.\r\n\r\n\"Are we reaching our destination?\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Let us act as if we were about reaching it,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"You are sceptical,\" retorted Michel Ardan.  \"We shall arrive,\r\nand that, too, quicker than we like.\"\r\n\r\nThis answer brought Barbicane back to his preparations, and he\r\noccupied himself with placing the contrivances intended to break\r\ntheir descent.  We may remember the scene of the meeting held at\r\nTampa Town, in Florida, when Captain Nicholl came forward as\r\nBarbicane's enemy and Michel Ardan's adversary.  To Captain\r\nNicholl's maintaining that the projectile would smash like glass,\r\nMichel replied that he would break their fall by means of rockets\r\nproperly placed.\r\n\r\nThus, powerful fireworks, taking their starting-point from the\r\nbase and bursting outside, could, by producing a recoil, check\r\nto a certain degree the projectile's speed.  These rockets were\r\nto burn in space, it is true; but oxygen would not fail them,\r\nfor they could supply themselves with it, like the lunar\r\nvolcanoes, the burning of which has never yet been stopped by\r\nthe want of atmosphere round the moon.\r\n\r\nBarbicane had accordingly supplied himself with these fireworks,\r\nenclosed in little steel guns, which could be screwed on to the\r\nbase of the projectile.  Inside, these guns were flush with the\r\nbottom; outside, they protruded about eighteen inches.  There were\r\ntwenty of them.  An opening left in the disc allowed them to light\r\nthe match with which each was provided.  All the effect was\r\nfelt outside.  The burning mixture had already been rammed\r\ninto each gun.  They had, then, nothing to do but raise the\r\nmetallic buffers fixed in the base, and replace them by the\r\nguns, which fitted closely in their places.\r\n\r\nThis new work was finished about three o'clock, and after taking\r\nall these precautions there remained but to wait.  But the\r\nprojectile was perceptibly nearing the moon, and evidently\r\nsuccumbed to her influence to a certain degree; though its\r\nown velocity also drew it in an oblique direction.  From these\r\nconflicting influences resulted a line which might become\r\na tangent.  But it was certain that the projectile would not\r\nfall directly on the moon; for its lower part, by reason of\r\nits weight, ought to be turned toward her.\r\n\r\nBarbicane's uneasiness increased as he saw his projectile resist\r\nthe influence of gravitation.  The Unknown was opening before\r\nhim, the Unknown in interplanetary space.  The man of science\r\nthought he had foreseen the only three hypotheses possible-- the\r\nreturn to the earth, the return to the moon, or stagnation on\r\nthe neutral line; and here a fourth hypothesis, big with all the\r\nterrors of the Infinite, surged up inopportunely.  To face it\r\nwithout flinching, one must be a resolute savant like Barbicane,\r\na phlegmatic being like Nicholl, or an audacious adventurer like\r\nMichel Ardan.\r\n\r\nConversation was started upon this subject.  Other men would\r\nhave considered the question from a practical point of view;\r\nthey would have asked themselves whither their projectile\r\ncarriage was carrying them.  Not so with these; they sought for\r\nthe cause which produced this effect.\r\n\r\n\"So we have become diverted from our route,\" said Michel; \"but why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I very much fear,\" answered Nicholl, \"that, in spite of\r\nall precautions taken, the Columbiad was not fairly pointed.\r\nAn error, however small, would be enough to throw us out of\r\nthe moon's attraction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then they must have aimed badly?\" asked Michel.\r\n\r\n\"I do not think so,\" replied Barbicane.  \"The perpendicularity\r\nof the gun was exact, its direction to the zenith of the spot\r\nincontestible; and the moon passing to the zenith of the spot,\r\nwe ought to reach it at the full.  There is another reason,\r\nbut it escapes me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we not arriving too late?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Too late?\" said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" continued Nicholl.  \"The Cambridge Observatory's note\r\nsays that the transit ought to be accomplished in ninety-seven\r\nhours thirteen minutes and twenty seconds; which means to say,\r\nthat _sooner_ the moon will _not_ be at the point indicated, and\r\n_later_ it will have passed it.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" replied Barbicane.  \"But we started the 1st of December,\r\nat thirteen minutes and twenty-five seconds to eleven at night;\r\nand we ought to arrive on the 5th at midnight, at the exact\r\nmoment when the moon would be full; and we are now at the\r\n5th of December.  It is now half-past three in the evening;\r\nhalf-past eight ought to see us at the end of our journey.\r\nWhy do we not arrive?\"\r\n\r\n\"Might it not be an excess of speed?\" answered Nicholl; \"for we\r\nknow now that its initial velocity was greater than they supposed.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! a hundred times, no!\" replied Barbicane.  \"An excess of\r\nspeed, if the direction of the projectile had been right, would\r\nnot have prevented us reaching the moon.  No, there has been\r\na deviation.  We have been turned out of our course.\"\r\n\r\n\"By whom? by what?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then, Barbicane,\" said Michel, \"do you wish to know\r\nmy opinion on the subject of finding out this deviation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would not give half a dollar to know it.  That we have\r\ndeviated is a fact.  Where we are going matters little; we shall\r\nsoon see.  Since we are being borne along in space we shall end\r\nby falling into some center of attraction or other.\"\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan's indifference did not content Barbicane.  Not that\r\nhe was uneasy about the future, but he wanted to know at any\r\ncost _why_ his projectile had deviated.\r\n\r\nBut the projectile continued its course sideways to the moon,\r\nand with it the mass of things thrown out.  Barbicane could even\r\nprove, by the elevations which served as landmarks upon the\r\nmoon, which was only two thousand leagues distant, that its\r\nspeed was becoming uniform-- fresh proof that there was no fall.\r\nIts impulsive force still prevailed over the lunar attraction,\r\nbut the projectile's course was certainly bringing it nearer to\r\nthe moon, and they might hope that at a nearer point the weight,\r\npredominating, would cause a decided fall.\r\n\r\nThe three friends, having nothing better to do, continued their\r\nobservations; but they could not yet determine the topographical\r\nposition of the satellite; every relief was leveled under the\r\nreflection of the solar rays.\r\n\r\nThey watched thus through the side windows until eight o'clock\r\nat night.  The moon had grown so large in their eyes that it\r\nfilled half of the firmament.  The sun on one side, and the orb\r\nof night on the other, flooded the projectile with light.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Barbicane thought he could estimate the distance\r\nwhich separated them from their aim at no more than 700 leagues.\r\nThe speed of the projectile seemed to him to be more than 200\r\nyards, or about 170 leagues a second.  Under the centripetal\r\nforce, the base of the projectile tended toward the moon; but\r\nthe centrifugal still prevailed; and it was probable that its\r\nrectilineal course would be changed to a curve of some sort,\r\nthe nature of which they could not at present determine.\r\n\r\nBarbicane was still seeking the solution of his insoluble problem.\r\nHours passed without any result.  The projectile was evidently\r\nnearing the moon, but it was also evident that it would never\r\nreach her.  As to the nearest distance at which it would pass her,\r\nthat must be the result of two forces, attraction and repulsion,\r\naffecting its motion.\r\n\r\n\"I ask but one thing,\" said Michel; \"that we may pass near\r\nenough to penetrate her secrets.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cursed be the thing that has caused our projectile to deviate\r\nfrom its course,\" cried Nicholl.\r\n\r\nAnd, as if a light had suddenly broken in upon his mind, Barbicane\r\nanswered, \"Then cursed be the meteor which crossed our path.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" said Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" exclaimed Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"I mean,\" said Barbicane in a decided tone, \"I mean that our\r\ndeviation is owing solely to our meeting with this erring body.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it did not even brush us as it passed,\" said Michel.\r\n\r\n\"What does that matter?  Its mass, compared to that of our\r\nprojectile, was enormous, and its attraction was enough to\r\ninfluence our course.\"\r\n\r\n\"So little?\" cried Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Nicholl; but however little it might be,\" replied\r\nBarbicane, \"in a distance of 84,000 leagues, it wanted no more\r\nto make us miss the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OBSERVERS OF THE MOON\r\n\r\n\r\nBarbicane had evidently hit upon the only plausible reason\r\nof this deviation.  However slight it might have been, it\r\nhad sufficed to modify the course of the projectile.  It was\r\na fatality.  The bold attempt had miscarried by a fortuitous\r\ncircumstance; and unless by some exceptional event, they could\r\nnow never reach the moon's disc.\r\n\r\nWould they pass near enough to be able to solve certain physical\r\nand geological questions until then insoluble?  This was the\r\nquestion, and the only one, which occupied the minds of these\r\nbold travelers.  As to the fate in store for themselves, they\r\ndid not even dream of it.\r\n\r\nBut what would become of them amid these infinite solitudes,\r\nthese who would soon want air?  A few more days, and they would\r\nfall stifled in this wandering projectile.  But some days to\r\nthese intrepid fellows was a century; and they devoted all their\r\ntime to observe that moon which they no longer hoped to reach.\r\n\r\nThe distance which had then separated the projectile from the\r\nsatellite was estimated at about two hundred leagues.  Under these\r\nconditions, as regards the visibility of the details of the disc,\r\nthe travelers were farther from the moon than are the inhabitants\r\nof earth with their powerful telescopes.\r\n\r\nIndeed, we know that the instrument mounted by Lord Rosse at\r\nParsonstown, which magnifies 6,500 times, brings the moon to\r\nwithin an apparent distance of sixteen leagues.  And more than\r\nthat, with the powerful one set up at Long's Peak, the orb of\r\nnight, magnified 48,000 times, is brought to within less than\r\ntwo leagues, and objects having a diameter of thirty feet are\r\nseen very distinctly.  So that, at this distance, the\r\ntopographical details of the moon, observed without glasses,\r\ncould not be determined with precision.  The eye caught the vast\r\noutline of those immense depressions inappropriately called\r\n\"seas,\" but they could not recognize their nature.  The prominence\r\nof the mountains disappeared under the splendid irradiation\r\nproduced by the reflection of the solar rays.  The eye, dazzled\r\nas if it was leaning over a bath of molten silver, turned from\r\nit involuntarily; but the oblong form of the orb was quite clear.\r\nIt appeared like a gigantic egg, with the small end turned toward\r\nthe earth.  Indeed the moon, liquid and pliable in the first days\r\nof its formation, was originally a perfect sphere; but being soon\r\ndrawn within the attraction of the earth, it became elongated\r\nunder the influence of gravitation.  In becoming a satellite,\r\nshe lost her native purity of form; her center of gravity was in\r\nadvance of the center of her figure; and from this fact some\r\nsavants draw the conclusion that the air and water had taken\r\nrefuge on the opposite surface of the moon, which is never seen\r\nfrom the earth.  This alteration in the primitive form of the\r\nsatellite was only perceptible for a few moments.  The distance\r\nof the projectile from the moon diminished very rapidly under\r\nits speed, though that was much less than its initial velocity--\r\nbut eight or nine times greater than that which propels our\r\nexpress trains.  The oblique course of the projectile, from its\r\nvery obliquity, gave Michel Ardan some hopes of striking the\r\nlunar disc at some point or other.  He could not think that they\r\nwould never reach it.  No! he could not believe it; and this\r\nopinion he often repeated.  But Barbicane, who was a better\r\njudge, always answered him with merciless logic.\r\n\r\n\"No, Michel, no!  We can only reach the moon by a fall, and we\r\nare not falling.  The centripetal force keeps us under the\r\nmoon's influence, but the centrifugal force draws us\r\nirresistibly away from it.\"\r\n\r\nThis was said in a tone which quenched Michel Ardan's last hope.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the moon which the projectile was nearing was the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, that which the selenographic maps place\r\nbelow; for these maps are generally drawn after the outline\r\ngiven by the glasses, and we know that they reverse the objects.\r\nSuch was the _Mappa Selenographica_ of Boeer and Moedler which\r\nBarbicane consulted.  This northern hemisphere presented vast\r\nplains, dotted with isolated mountains.\r\n\r\nAt midnight the moon was full.  At that precise moment the\r\ntravelers should have alighted upon it, if the mischievous\r\nmeteor had not diverted their course.  The orb was exactly in\r\nthe condition determined by the Cambridge Observatory.  It was\r\nmathematically at its perigee, and at the zenith of the\r\ntwenty-eighth parallel.  An observer placed at the bottom of the\r\nenormous Columbiad, pointed perpendicularly to the horizon,\r\nwould have framed the moon in the mouth of the gun.  A straight\r\nline drawn through the axis of the piece would have passed\r\nthrough the center of the orb of night.  It is needless to say,\r\nthat during the night of the 5th-6th of December, the travelers\r\ntook not an instant's rest.  Could they close their eyes when so\r\nnear this new world?  No!  All their feelings were concentrated\r\nin one single thought:-- See!  Representatives of the earth, of\r\nhumanity, past and present, all centered in them!  It is through\r\ntheir eyes that the human race look at these lunar regions, and\r\npenetrate the secrets of their satellite!  A strange emotion\r\nfilled their hearts as they went from one window to the other.\r\nTheir observations, reproduced by Barbicane, were rigidly determined.\r\nTo take them, they had glasses; to correct them, maps.\r\n\r\nAs regards the optical instruments at their disposal, they had\r\nexcellent marine glasses specially constructed for this journey.\r\nThey possessed magnifying powers of 100.  They would thus have\r\nbrought the moon to within a distance (apparent) of less than\r\n2,000 leagues from the earth.  But then, at a distance which for\r\nthree hours in the morning did not exceed sixty-five miles, and\r\nin a medium free from all atmospheric disturbances, these\r\ninstruments could reduce the lunar surface to within less than\r\n1,500 yards!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nFANCY AND REALITY\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever seen the moon?\" asked a professor, ironically,\r\nof one of his pupils.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir!\" replied the pupil, still more ironically, \"but I must\r\nsay I have heard it spoken of.\"\r\n\r\nIn one sense, the pupil's witty answer might be given by a large\r\nmajority of sublunary beings.  How many people have heard speak\r\nof the moon who have never seen it-- at least through a glass or\r\na telescope!  How many have never examined the map of their satellite!\r\n\r\nIn looking at a selenographic map, one peculiarity strikes us.\r\nContrary to the arrangement followed for that of the Earth and\r\nMars, the continents occupy more particularly the southern\r\nhemisphere of the lunar globe.  These continents do not show\r\nsuch decided, clear, and regular boundary lines as South\r\nAmerica, Africa, and the Indian peninsula.  Their angular,\r\ncapricious, and deeply indented coasts are rich in gulfs\r\nand peninsulas.  They remind one of the confusion in the\r\nislands of the Sound, where the land is excessively indented.\r\nIf navigation ever existed on the surface of the moon, it must\r\nhave been wonderfully difficult and dangerous; and we may well\r\npity the Selenite sailors and hydrographers; the former, when\r\nthey came upon these perilous coasts, the latter when they\r\ntook the soundings of its stormy banks.\r\n\r\nWe may also notice that, on the lunar sphere, the south pole is\r\nmuch more continental than the north pole.  On the latter, there\r\nis but one slight strip of land separated from other continents\r\nby vast seas.  Toward the south, continents clothe almost the\r\nwhole of the hemisphere.  It is even possible that the Selenites\r\nhave already planted the flag on one of their poles, while\r\nFranklin, Ross, Kane, Dumont, d'Urville, and Lambert have never\r\nyet been able to attain that unknown point of the terrestrial globe.\r\n\r\nAs to islands, they are numerous on the surface of the moon.\r\nNearly all oblong or circular, and as if traced with the\r\ncompass, they seem to form one vast archipelago, equal to that\r\ncharming group lying between Greece and Asia Minor, and which\r\nmythology in ancient times adorned with most graceful legends.\r\nInvoluntarily the names of Naxos, Tenedos, and Carpathos, rise\r\nbefore the mind, and we seek vainly for Ulysses' vessel or the\r\n\"clipper\" of the Argonauts.  So at least it was in Michel\r\nArdan's eyes.  To him it was a Grecian archipelago that he saw\r\non the map.  To the eyes of his matter-of-fact companions, the\r\naspect of these coasts recalled rather the parceled-out land of\r\nNew Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and where the Frenchman\r\ndiscovered traces of the heroes of fable, these Americans\r\nwere marking the most favorable points for the establishment\r\nof stores in the interests of lunar commerce and industry.\r\n\r\nAfter wandering over these vast continents, the eye is attracted\r\nby the still greater seas.  Not only their formation, but their\r\nsituation and aspect remind one of the terrestrial oceans; but\r\nagain, as on earth, these seas occupy the greater portion of\r\nthe globe.  But in point of fact, these are not liquid spaces,\r\nbut plains, the nature of which the travelers hoped soon\r\nto determine.  Astronomers, we must allow, have graced these\r\npretended seas with at least odd names, which science has\r\nrespected up to the present time.  Michel Ardan was right when\r\nhe compared this map to a \"Tendre card,\" got up by a Scudary or\r\na Cyrano de Bergerac.  \"Only,\" said he, \"it is no longer the\r\nsentimental card of the seventeenth century, it is the card of\r\nlife, very neatly divided into two parts, one feminine, the\r\nother masculine; the right hemisphere for woman, the left for man.\"\r\n\r\nIn speaking thus, Michel made his prosaic companions shrug\r\ntheir shoulders.  Barbicane and Nicholl looked upon the lunar\r\nmap from a very different point of view to that of their\r\nfantastic friend.  Nevertheless, their fantastic friend was a\r\nlittle in the right.  Judge for yourselves.\r\n\r\nIn the left hemisphere stretches the \"Sea of Clouds,\" where\r\nhuman reason is so often shipwrecked.  Not far off lies the \"Sea\r\nof Rains,\" fed by all the fever of existence.  Near this is the\r\n\"Sea of Storms,\" where man is ever fighting against his\r\npassions, which too often gain the victory.  Then, worn out by\r\ndeceit, treasons, infidelity, and the whole body of terrestrial\r\nmisery, what does he find at the end of his career? that vast\r\n\"Sea of Humors,\" barely softened by some drops of the waters\r\nfrom the \"Gulf of Dew!\"  Clouds, rain, storms, and humors-- does\r\nthe life of man contain aught but these? and is it not summed up\r\nin these four words?\r\n\r\nThe right hemisphere, \"dedicated to the ladies,\" encloses\r\nsmaller seas, whose significant names contain every incident of\r\na feminine existence.  There is the \"Sea of Serenity,\" over\r\nwhich the young girl bends; \"The Lake of Dreams,\" reflecting a\r\njoyous future; \"The Sea of Nectar,\" with its waves of tenderness\r\nand breezes of love; \"The Sea of Fruitfulness;\" \"The Sea of\r\nCrises;\" then the \"Sea of Vapors,\" whose dimensions are perhaps\r\na little too confined; and lastly, that vast \"Sea of\r\nTranquillity,\" in which every false passion, every useless\r\ndream, every unsatisfied desire is at length absorbed, and whose\r\nwaves emerge peacefully into the \"Lake of Death!\"\r\n\r\nWhat a strange succession of names!  What a singular division of\r\nthe moon's two hemispheres, joined to one another like man and\r\nwoman, and forming that sphere of life carried into space!\r\nAnd was not the fantastic Michel right in thus interpreting the\r\nfancies of the ancient astronomers?  But while his imagination\r\nthus roved over \"the seas,\" his grave companions were considering\r\nthings more geographically.  They were learning this new world\r\nby heart.  They were measuring angles and diameters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nOROGRAPHIC DETAILS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe course taken by the projectile, as we have before remarked, was\r\nbearing it toward the moon's northern hemisphere.  The travelers\r\nwere far from the central point which they would have struck,\r\nhad their course not been subject to an irremediable deviation.\r\nIt was past midnight; and Barbicane then estimated the distance\r\nat seven hundred and fifty miles, which was a little greater than\r\nthe length of the lunar radius, and which would diminish as it\r\nadvanced nearer to the North Pole.  The projectile was then not\r\nat the altitude of the equator; but across the tenth parallel,\r\nand from that latitude, carefully taken on the map to the pole,\r\nBarbicane and his two companions were able to observe the moon\r\nunder the most favorable conditions.  Indeed, by means of glasses,\r\nthe above-named distance was reduced to little more than\r\nfourteen miles.  The telescope of the Rocky Mountains brought\r\nthe moon much nearer; but the terrestrial atmosphere singularly\r\nlessened its power.  Thus Barbicane, posted in his projectile,\r\nwith the glasses to his eyes, could seize upon details which were\r\nalmost imperceptible to earthly observers.\r\n\r\n\"My friends,\" said the president, in a serious voice, \"I do not\r\nknow whither we are going; I do not know if we shall ever see\r\nthe terrestrial globe again.  Nevertheless, let us proceed as if\r\nour work would one day by useful to our fellow-men.  Let us keep\r\nour minds free from every other consideration.  We are\r\nastronomers; and this projectile is a room in the Cambridge\r\nUniversity, carried into space.  Let us make our observations!\"\r\n\r\nThis said, work was begun with great exactness; and they\r\nfaithfully reproduced the different aspects of the moon,\r\nat the different distances which the projectile reached.\r\n\r\nAt the time that the projectile was as high as the tenth\r\nparallel, north latitude, it seemed rigidly to follow the\r\ntwentieth degree, east longitude.  We must here make one\r\nimportant remark with regard to the map by which they were\r\ntaking observations.  In the selenographical maps where, on\r\naccount of the reversing of the objects by the glasses, the\r\nsouth is above and the north below, it would seem natural that,\r\non account of that inversion, the east should be to the left\r\nhand, and the west to the right.  But it is not so.  If the map\r\nwere turned upside down, showing the moon as we see her, the\r\neast would be to the left, and the west to the right, contrary\r\nto that which exists on terrestrial maps.  The following is the\r\nreason of this anomaly.  Observers in the northern hemisphere\r\n(say in Europe) see the moon in the south-- according to them.\r\nWhen they take observations, they turn their backs to the north,\r\nthe reverse position to that which they occupy when they study\r\na terrestrial map.  As they turn their backs to the north, the\r\neast is on their left, and the west to their right.  To observers\r\nin the southern hemisphere (Patagonia for example), the moon's\r\nwest would be quite to their left, and the east to their right,\r\nas the south is behind them.  Such is the reason of the apparent\r\nreversing of these two cardinal points, and we must bear it in mind\r\nin order to be able to follow President Barbicane's observations.\r\n\r\nWith the help of Boeer and Moedler's _Mappa Selenographica_,\r\nthe travelers were able at once to recognize that portion\r\nof the disc enclosed within the field of their glasses.\r\n\r\n\"What are we looking at, at this moment?\" asked Michel.\r\n\r\n\"At the northern part of the `Sea of Clouds,'\" answered Barbicane.\r\n\"We are too far off to recognize its nature.  Are these plains\r\ncomposed of arid sand, as the first astronomer maintained?\r\nOr are they nothing but immense forests, according to M. Warren\r\nde la Rue's opinion, who gives the moon an atmosphere, though\r\na very low and a very dense one?  That we shall know by and by.\r\nWe must affirm nothing until we are in a position to do so.\"\r\n\r\nThis \"Sea of Clouds\" is rather doubtfully marked out upon the maps.\r\nIt is supposed that these vast plains are strewn with blocks of\r\nlava from the neighboring volcanoes on its right, Ptolemy,\r\nPurbach, Arzachel.  But the projectile was advancing, and sensibly\r\nnearing it.  Soon there appeared the heights which bound this sea\r\nat this northern limit.  Before them rose a mountain radiant with\r\nbeauty, the top of which seemed lost in an eruption of solar rays.\r\n\r\n\"That is--?\" asked Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Copernicus,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Let us see Copernicus.\"\r\n\r\nThis mount, situated in 9@ north latitude and 20@ east\r\nlongitude, rose to a height of 10,600 feet above the surface of\r\nthe moon.  It is quite visible from the earth; and astronomers\r\ncan study it with ease, particularly during the phase between\r\nthe last quarter and the new moon, because then the shadows are\r\nthrown lengthways from east to west, allowing them to measure\r\nthe heights.\r\n\r\nThis Copernicus forms the most important of the radiating\r\nsystem, situated in the southern hemisphere, according to Tycho\r\nBrahe.  It rises isolated like a gigantic lighthouse on that\r\nportion of the \"Sea of Clouds,\" which is bounded by the \"Sea of\r\nTempests,\" thus lighting by its splendid rays two oceans at\r\na time.  It was a sight without an equal, those long luminous\r\ntrains, so dazzling in the full moon, and which, passing the\r\nboundary chain on the north, extends to the \"Sea of Rains.\"\r\nAt one o'clock of the terrestrial morning, the projectile,\r\nlike a balloon borne into space, overlooked the top of this\r\nsuperb mount.  Barbicane could recognize perfectly its\r\nchief features.  Copernicus is comprised in the series of\r\nringed mountains of the first order, in the division of\r\ngreat circles.  Like Kepler and Aristarchus, which overlook\r\nthe \"Ocean of Tempests,\" sometimes it appeared like a brilliant\r\npoint through the cloudy light, and was taken for a volcano\r\nin activity.  But it is only an extinct one-- like all on that\r\nside of the moon.  Its circumference showed a diameter of about\r\ntwenty-two leagues.  The glasses discovered traces of\r\nstratification produced by successive eruptions, and the\r\nneighborhood was strewn with volcanic remains which still choked\r\nsome of the craters.\r\n\r\n\"There exist,\" said Barbicane, \"several kinds of circles on the\r\nsurface of the moon, and it is easy to see that Copernicus\r\nbelongs to the radiating class.  If we were nearer, we should\r\nsee the cones bristling on the inside, which in former times\r\nwere so many fiery mouths.  A curious arrangement, and one\r\nwithout an exception on the lunar disc, is that the interior\r\nsurface of these circles is the reverse of the exterior, and\r\ncontrary to the form taken by terrestrial craters.  It follows,\r\nthen, that the general curve of the bottom of these circles\r\ngives a sphere of a smaller diameter than that of the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why this peculiar disposition?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"We do not know,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"What splendid radiation!\" said Michel.  \"One could hardly see\r\na finer spectacle, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you say, then,\" replied Barbicane, \"if chance should\r\nbear us toward the southern hemisphere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I should say that it was still more beautiful,\" retorted\r\nMichel Ardan.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the projectile hung perpendicularly over the circle.\r\nThe circumference of Copernicus formed almost a perfect circle,\r\nand its steep escarpments were clearly defined.  They could even\r\ndistinguish a second ringed enclosure.  Around spread a grayish\r\nplain, of a wild aspect, on which every relief was marked in yellow.\r\nAt the bottom of the circle, as if enclosed in a jewel case,\r\nsparkled for one instant two or three eruptive cones, like enormous\r\ndazzling gems.  Toward the north the escarpments were lowered by a\r\ndepression which would probably have given access to the interior\r\nof the crater.\r\n\r\nIn passing over the surrounding plains, Barbicane noticed a\r\ngreat number of less important mountains; and among others a\r\nlittle ringed one called Guy Lussac, the breadth of which\r\nmeasured twelve miles.\r\n\r\nToward the south, the plain was very flat, without one\r\nelevation, without one projection.  Toward the north, on the\r\ncontrary, till where it was bounded by the \"Sea of Storms,\" it\r\nresembled a liquid surface agitated by a storm, of which the\r\nhills and hollows formed a succession of waves suddenly congealed.\r\nOver the whole of this, and in all directions, lay the luminous\r\nlines, all converging to the summit of Copernicus.\r\n\r\nThe travelers discussed the origin of these strange rays; but they\r\ncould not determine their nature any more than terrestrial observers.\r\n\r\n\"But why,\" said Nicholl, \"should not these rays be simply spurs\r\nof mountains which reflect more vividly the light of the sun?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Barbicane; \"if it was so, under certain conditions\r\nof the moon, these ridges would cast shadows, and they do not\r\ncast any.\"\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, these rays only appeared when the orb of day was in\r\nopposition to the moon, and disappeared as soon as its rays\r\nbecame oblique.\r\n\r\n\"But how have they endeavored to explain these lines of light?\"\r\nasked Michel; \"for I cannot believe that savants would ever be\r\nstranded for want of an explanation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Barbicane; \"Herschel has put forward an opinion,\r\nbut he did not venture to affirm it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind.  What was the opinion?\"\r\n\r\n\"He thought that these rays might be streams of cooled lava\r\nwhich shone when the sun beat straight upon them.  It may be so;\r\nbut nothing can be less certain.  Besides, if we pass nearer to\r\nTycho, we shall be in a better position to find out the cause of\r\nthis radiation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, my friends, what that plain, seen from the height\r\nwe are at, resembles?\" said Michel.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Very well; with all those pieces of lava lengthened like rockets,\r\nit resembles an immense game of spelikans thrown pellmell.\r\nThere wants but the hook to pull them out one by one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do be serious,\" said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Well, let us be serious,\" replied Michel quietly; \"and instead\r\nof spelikans, let us put bones.  This plain, would then be\r\nnothing but an immense cemetery, on which would repose the\r\nmortal remains of thousands of extinct generations.  Do you\r\nprefer that high-flown comparison?\"\r\n\r\n\"One is as good as the other,\" retorted Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"My word, you are difficult to please,\" answered Michel.\r\n\r\n\"My worthy friend,\" continued the matter-of-fact Barbicane, \"it\r\nmatters but little what it _resembles_, when we do not know what\r\nit _is_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well answered,\" exclaimed Michel.  \"That will teach me to\r\nreason with savants.\"\r\n\r\nBut the projectile continued to advance with almost uniform\r\nspeed around the lunar disc.  The travelers, we may easily\r\nimagine, did not dream of taking a moment's rest.  Every minute\r\nchanged the landscape which fled from beneath their gaze.\r\nAbout half past one o'clock in the morning, they caught a glimpse\r\nof the tops of another mountain.  Barbicane, consulting his map,\r\nrecognized Eratosthenes.\r\n\r\nIt was a ringed mountain nine thousand feet high, and one of\r\nthose circles so numerous on this satellite.  With regard to\r\nthis, Barbicane related Kepler's singular opinion on the\r\nformation of circles.  According to that celebrated\r\nmathematician, these crater-like cavities had been dug by the\r\nhand of man.\r\n\r\n\"For what purpose?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"For a very natural one,\" replied Barbicane.  \"The Selenites\r\nmight have undertaken these immense works and dug these enormous\r\nholes for a refuge and shield from the solar rays which beat\r\nupon them during fifteen consecutive days.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Selenites are not fools,\" said Michel.\r\n\r\n\"A singular idea,\" replied Nicholl; \"but it is probable that\r\nKepler did not know the true dimensions of these circles, for\r\nthe digging of them would have been the work of giants quite\r\nimpossible for the Selenites.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? if weight on the moon's surface is six times less than on\r\nthe earth?\" said Michel.\r\n\r\n\"But if the Selenites are six times smaller?\" retorted Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"And if there are _no_ Selenites?\" added Barbicane.\r\n\r\nThis put an end to the discussion.\r\n\r\nSoon Eratosthenes disappeared under the horizon without the\r\nprojectile being sufficiently near to allow close observation.\r\nThis mountain separated the Apennines from the Carpathians. In the\r\nlunar orography they have discerned some chains of mountains, which\r\nare chiefly distributed over the northern hemisphere.  Some, however,\r\noccupy certain portions of the southern hemisphere also.\r\n\r\nAbout two o'clock in the morning Barbicane found that they were\r\nabove the twentieth lunar parallel.  The distance of the\r\nprojectile from the moon was not more than six hundred miles.\r\nBarbicane, now perceiving that the projectile was steadily\r\napproaching the lunar disc, did not despair; if not of reaching\r\nher, at least of discovering the secrets of her configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nLUNAR LANDSCAPES\r\n\r\n\r\nAt half-past two in the morning, the projectile was over the\r\nthirteenth lunar parallel and at the effective distance of five\r\nhundred miles, reduced by the glasses to five.  It still seemed\r\nimpossible, however, that it could ever touch any part of the disc.\r\nIts motive speed, comparatively so moderate, was inexplicable to\r\nPresident Barbicane.  At that distance from the moon it must have\r\nbeen considerable, to enable it to bear up against her attraction.\r\nHere was a phenomenon the cause of which escaped them again.\r\nBesides, time failed them to investigate the cause.  All lunar\r\nrelief was defiling under the eyes of the travelers, and they\r\nwould not lose a single detail.\r\n\r\nUnder the glasses the disc appeared at the distance of five\r\nmiles.  What would an aeronaut, borne to this distance from the\r\nearth, distinguish on its surface?  We cannot say, since the\r\ngreatest ascension has not been more than 25,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is an exact description of what Barbicane and his\r\ncompanions saw at this height.  Large patches of different\r\ncolors appeared on the disc.  Selenographers are not agreed upon\r\nthe nature of these colors.  There are several, and rather\r\nvividly marked.  Julius Schmidt pretends that, if the\r\nterrestrial oceans were dried up, a Selenite observer could not\r\ndistinguish on the globe a greater diversity of shades between\r\nthe oceans and the continental plains than those on the moon\r\npresent to a terrestrial observer.  According to him, the color\r\ncommon to the vast plains known by the name of \"seas\" is a dark\r\ngray mixed with green and brown.  Some of the large craters\r\npresent the same appearance.  Barbicane knew this opinion of the\r\nGerman selenographer, an opinion shared by Boeer and Moedler.\r\nObservation has proved that right was on their side, and not on\r\nthat of some astronomers who admit the existence of only gray on\r\nthe moon's surface.  In some parts green was very distinct, such\r\nas springs, according to Julius Schmidt, from the seas of\r\n\"Serenity and Humors.\"  Barbicane also noticed large craters,\r\nwithout any interior cones, which shed a bluish tint similar to\r\nthe reflection of a sheet of steel freshly polished.  These colors\r\nbelonged really to the lunar disc, and did not result, as some\r\nastronomers say, either from the imperfection in the objective\r\nof the glasses or from the interposition of the terrestrial atmosphere.\r\n\r\nNot a doubt existed in Barbicane's mind with regard to it, as he\r\nobserved it through space, and so could not commit any optical error.\r\nHe considered the establishment of this fact as an acquisition\r\nto science.  Now, were these shades of green, belonging to\r\ntropical vegetation, kept up by a low dense atmosphere?  He could\r\nnot yet say.\r\n\r\nFarther on, he noticed a reddish tint, quite defined.  The same\r\nshade had before been observed at the bottom of an isolated\r\nenclosure, known by the name of Lichtenburg's circle, which is\r\nsituated near the Hercynian mountains, on the borders of the\r\nmoon; but they could not tell the nature of it.\r\n\r\nThey were not more fortunate with regard to another peculiarity\r\nof the disc, for they could not decide upon the cause of it.\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan was watching near the president, when he noticed\r\nlong white lines, vividly lighted up by the direct rays of the sun.\r\nIt was a succession of luminous furrows, very different from the\r\nradiation of Copernicus not long before; they ran parallel with\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nMichel, with his usual readiness, hastened to exclaim:\r\n\r\n\"Look there! cultivated fields!\"\r\n\r\n\"Cultivated fields!\" replied Nicholl, shrugging his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Plowed, at all events,\" retorted Michel Ardan; \"but what\r\nlaborers those Selenites must be, and what giant oxen they must\r\nharness to their plow to cut such furrows!\"\r\n\r\n\"They are not furrows,\" said Barbicane; \"they are _rifts_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rifts? stuff!\" replied Michel mildly; \"but what do you mean by\r\n`rifts' in the scientific world?\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane immediately enlightened his companion as to what he\r\nknew about lunar rifts.  He knew that they were a kind of furrow\r\nfound on every part of the disc which was not mountainous; that\r\nthese furrows, generally isolated, measured from 400 to 500\r\nleagues in length; that their breadth varied from 1,000 to 1,500\r\nyards, and that their borders were strictly parallel; but he\r\nknew nothing more either of their formation or their nature.\r\n\r\nBarbicane, through his glasses, observed these rifts with\r\ngreat attention.  He noticed that their borders were formed of\r\nsteep declivities; they were long parallel ramparts, and with some\r\nsmall amount of imagination he might have admitted the existence\r\nof long lines of fortifications, raised by Selenite engineers.\r\nOf these different rifts some were perfectly straight, as if cut\r\nby a line; others were slightly curved, though still keeping\r\ntheir borders parallel; some crossed each other, some cut through\r\ncraters; here they wound through ordinary cavities, such as\r\nPosidonius or Petavius; there they wound through the seas, such\r\nas the \"Sea of Serenity.\"\r\n\r\nThese natural accidents naturally excited the imaginations of\r\nthese terrestrial astronomers.  The first observations had not\r\ndiscovered these rifts.  Neither Hevelius, Cassin, La Hire, nor\r\nHerschel seemed to have known them.  It was Schroeter who in\r\n1789 first drew attention to them.  Others followed who studied\r\nthem, as Pastorff, Gruithuysen, Boeer, and Moedler.  At this\r\ntime their number amounts to seventy; but, if they have been\r\ncounted, their nature has not yet been determined; they are\r\ncertainly _not_ fortifications, any more than they are the\r\nancient beds of dried-up rivers; for, on one side, the waters,\r\nso slight on the moon's surface, could never have worn such\r\ndrains for themselves; and, on the other, they often cross\r\ncraters of great elevation.\r\n\r\nWe must, however, allow that Michel Ardan had \"an idea,\" and\r\nthat, without knowing it, he coincided in that respect with\r\nJulius Schmidt.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said he, \"should not these unaccountable appearances be\r\nsimply phenomena of vegetation?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Barbicane quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Do not excite yourself, my worthy president,\" replied Michel;\r\n\"might it not be possible that the dark lines forming that\r\nbastion were rows of trees regularly placed?\"\r\n\r\n\"You stick to your vegetation, then?\" said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"I like,\" retorted Michel Ardan, \"to explain what you savants\r\ncannot explain; at least my hypotheses has the advantage of\r\nindicating why these rifts disappear, or seem to disappear, at\r\ncertain seasons.\"\r\n\r\n\"And for what reason?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the reason that the trees become invisible when they lose\r\ntheir leaves, and visible again when they regain them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your explanation is ingenious, my dear companion,\" replied\r\nBarbicane, \"but inadmissible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because, so to speak, there are no seasons on the moon's surface,\r\nand that, consequently, the phenomena of vegetation of which you\r\nspeak cannot occur.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, the slight obliquity of the lunar axis keeps the sun at\r\nan almost equal height in every latitude.  Above the equatorial\r\nregions the radiant orb almost invariably occupies the zenith,\r\nand does not pass the limits of the horizon in the polar\r\nregions; thus, according to each region, there reigns a\r\nperpetual winter, spring, summer, or autumn, as in the planet\r\nJupiter, whose axis is but little inclined upon its orbit.\r\n\r\nWhat origin do they attribute to these rifts?  That is a\r\nquestion difficult to solve.  They are certainly anterior to the\r\nformation of craters and circles, for several have introduced\r\nthemselves by breaking through their circular ramparts.  Thus it\r\nmay be that, contemporary with the later geological epochs, they\r\nare due to the expansion of natural forces.\r\n\r\nBut the projectile had now attained the fortieth degree of lunar\r\nlatitude, at a distance not exceeding 40 miles.  Through the\r\nglasses objects appeared to be only four miles distant.\r\n\r\nAt this point, under their feet, rose Mount Helicon, 1,520 feet\r\nhigh, and round about the left rose moderate elevations,\r\nenclosing a small portion of the \"Sea of Rains,\" under the name\r\nof the Gulf of Iris.  The terrestrial atmosphere would have to\r\nbe one hundred and seventy times more transparent than it is,\r\nto allow astronomers to make perfect observations on the moon's\r\nsurface; but in the void in which the projectile floated no\r\nfluid interposed itself between the eye of the observer and\r\nthe object observed.  And more, Barbicane found himself carried\r\nto a greater distance than the most powerful telescopes had\r\never done before, either that of Lord Rosse or that of the\r\nRocky Mountains.  He was, therefore, under extremely favorable\r\nconditions for solving that great question of the habitability\r\nof the moon; but the solution still escaped him; he could\r\ndistinguish nothing but desert beds, immense plains, and toward\r\nthe north, arid mountains.  Not a work betrayed the hand of man;\r\nnot a ruin marked his course; not a group of animals was to be\r\nseen indicating life, even in an inferior degree.  In no part\r\nwas there life, in no part was there an appearance of vegetation.\r\nOf the three kingdoms which share the terrestrial globe between\r\nthem, one alone was represented on the lunar and that the mineral.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, indeed!\" said Michel Ardan, a little out of countenance;\r\n\"then you see no one?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Nicholl; \"up to this time, not a man, not an\r\nanimal, not a tree!  After all, whether the atmosphere has taken\r\nrefuge at the bottom of cavities, in the midst of the circles,\r\nor even on the opposite face of the moon, we cannot decide.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" added Barbicane, \"even to the most piercing eye a man\r\ncannot be distinguished farther than three and a half miles off;\r\nso that, if there are any Selenites, they can see our projectile,\r\nbut we cannot see them.\"\r\n\r\nToward four in the morning, at the height of the fiftieth\r\nparallel, the distance was reduced to 300 miles.  To the left\r\nran a line of mountains capriciously shaped, lying in the\r\nfull light.  To the right, on the contrary, lay a black hollow\r\nresembling a vast well, unfathomable and gloomy, drilled into\r\nthe lunar soil.\r\n\r\nThis hole was the \"Black Lake\"; it was Pluto, a deep circle\r\nwhich can be conveniently studied from the earth, between the\r\nlast quarter and the new moon, when the shadows fall from west\r\nto east.\r\n\r\nThis black color is rarely met with on the surface of\r\nthe satellite.  As yet it has only been recognized in the depths\r\nof the circle of Endymion, to the east of the \"Cold Sea,\" in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, and at the bottom of Grimaldi's circle, on\r\nthe equator, toward the eastern border of the orb.\r\n\r\nPluto is an annular mountain, situated in 51@ north latitude,\r\nand 9@ east longitude.  Its circuit is forty-seven miles long\r\nand thirty-two broad.\r\n\r\nBarbicane regretted that they were not passing directly above\r\nthis vast opening.  There was an abyss to fathom, perhaps some\r\nmysterious phenomenon to surprise; but the projectile's course\r\ncould not be altered.  They must rigidly submit.  They could not\r\nguide a balloon, still less a projectile, when once enclosed\r\nwithin its walls.  Toward five in the morning the northern\r\nlimits of the \"Sea of Rains\" was at length passed.  The mounts\r\nof Condamine and Fontenelle remained-- one on the right, the\r\nother on the left.  That part of the disc beginning with 60@ was\r\nbecoming quite mountainous.  The glasses brought them to within\r\ntwo miles, less than that separating the summit of Mont Blanc\r\nfrom the level of the sea.  The whole region was bristling with\r\nspikes and circles.  Toward the 60@ Philolaus stood predominant\r\nat a height of 5,550 feet with its elliptical crater, and seen\r\nfrom this distance, the disc showed a very fantastical appearance.\r\nLandscapes were presented to the eye under very different\r\nconditions from those on the earth, and also very inferior to them.\r\n\r\nThe moon having no atmosphere, the consequences arising from\r\nthe absence of this gaseous envelope have already been shown.\r\nNo twilight on her surface; night following day and day following\r\nnight with the suddenness of a lamp which is extinguished or\r\nlighted amid profound darkness-- no transition from cold to\r\nheat, the temperature falling in an instant from boiling point\r\nto the cold of space.\r\n\r\nAnother consequence of this want of air is that absolute\r\ndarkness reigns where the sun's rays do not penetrate.\r\nThat which on earth is called diffusion of light, that luminous\r\nmatter which the air holds in suspension, which creates the\r\ntwilight and the daybreak, which produces the _umbrae_ and\r\n_penumbrae_, and all the magic of _chiaro-oscuro_, does not\r\nexist on the moon.  Hence the harshness of contrasts, which\r\nonly admit of two colors, black and white.  If a Selenite\r\nwere to shade his eyes from the sun's rays, the sky would seem\r\nabsolutely black, and the stars would shine to him as on the\r\ndarkest night.  Judge of the impression produced on Barbicane\r\nand his three friends by this strange scene!  Their eyes\r\nwere confused.  They could no longer grasp the respective\r\ndistances of the different plains.  A lunar landscape without\r\nthe softening of the phenomena of _chiaro-oscuro_ could not be\r\nrendered by an earthly landscape painter; it would be spots of\r\nink on a white page-- nothing more.\r\n\r\nThis aspect was not altered even when the projectile, at the\r\nheight of 80@, was only separated from the moon by a distance\r\nof fifty miles; nor even when, at five in the morning, it\r\npassed at less than twenty-five miles from the mountain of\r\nGioja, a distance reduced by the glasses to a quarter of a mile.\r\nIt seemed as if the moon might be touched by the hand!\r\nIt seemed impossible that, before long, the projectile would\r\nnot strike her, if only at the north pole, the brilliant arch\r\nof which was so distinctly visible on the black sky.\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan wanted to open one of the scuttles and throw\r\nhimself on to the moon's surface!  A very useless attempt; for\r\nif the projectile could not attain any point whatever of the\r\nsatellite, Michel, carried along by its motion, could not attain\r\nit either.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, at six o'clock, the lunar pole appeared.  The disc\r\nonly presented to the travelers' gaze one half brilliantly lit up,\r\nwhile the other disappeared in the darkness.  Suddenly the\r\nprojectile passed the line of demarcation between intense light\r\nand absolute darkness, and was plunged in profound night!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NIGHT OF THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY-FOUR HOURS AND A HALF\r\n\r\nAt the moment when this phenomenon took place so rapidly, the\r\nprojectile was skirting the moon's north pole at less than\r\ntwenty-five miles distance.  Some seconds had sufficed to plunge\r\nit into the absolute darkness of space.  The transition was so\r\nsudden, without shade, without gradation of light, without\r\nattenuation of the luminous waves, that the orb seemed to have\r\nbeen extinguished by a powerful blow.\r\n\r\n\"Melted, disappeared!\" Michel Ardan exclaimed, aghast.\r\n\r\nIndeed, there was neither reflection nor shadow.  Nothing more\r\nwas to be seen of that disc, formerly so dazzling.  The darkness\r\nwas complete. and rendered even more so by the rays from the stars.\r\nIt was \"that blackness\" in which the lunar nights are insteeped,\r\nwhich last three hundred and fifty-four hours and a half at each\r\npoint of the disc, a long night resulting from the equality of\r\nthe translatory and rotary movements of the moon.  The projectile,\r\nimmerged in the conical shadow of the satellite, experienced the\r\naction of the solar rays no more than any of its invisible points.\r\n\r\nIn the interior, the obscurity was complete.  They could not see\r\neach other.  Hence the necessity of dispelling the darkness.\r\nHowever desirous Barbicane might be to husband the gas, the\r\nreserve of which was small, he was obliged to ask from it a\r\nfictitious light, an expensive brilliancy which the sun then refused.\r\n\r\n\"Devil take the radiant orb!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, \"which\r\nforces us to expend gas, instead of giving us his rays gratuitously.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not let us accuse the sun,\" said Nicholl, \"it is not his\r\nfault, but that of the moon, which has come and placed herself\r\nlike a screen between us and it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the sun!\" continued Michel.\r\n\r\n\"It is the moon!\" retorted Nicholl.\r\n\r\nAn idle dispute, which Barbicane put an end to by saying:\r\n\r\n\"My friends, it is neither the fault of the sun nor of the moon;\r\nit is the fault of the _projectile_, which, instead of rigidly\r\nfollowing its course, has awkwardly missed it.  To be more just,\r\nit is the fault of that unfortunate meteor which has so\r\ndeplorably altered our first direction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied Michel Ardan, \"as the matter is settled, let us\r\nhave breakfast.  After a whole night of watching it is fair to\r\nbuild ourselves up a little.\"\r\n\r\nThis proposal meeting with no contradiction, Michel prepared the\r\nrepast in a few minutes.  But they ate for eating's sake, they\r\ndrank without toasts, without hurrahs.  The bold travelers being\r\nborne away into gloomy space, without their accustomed\r\n_cortege_ of rays, felt a vague uneasiness in their hearts.\r\nThe \"strange\" shadow so dear to Victor Hugo's pen bound them on\r\nall sides.  But they talked over the interminable night of three\r\nhundred and fifty-four hours and a half, nearly fifteen days,\r\nwhich the law of physics has imposed on the inhabitants of the moon.\r\n\r\nBarbicane gave his friends some explanation of the causes and\r\nthe consequences of this curious phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\"Curious indeed,\" said they; \"for, if each hemisphere of the\r\nmoon is deprived of solar light for fifteen days, that above\r\nwhich we now float does not even enjoy during its long night any\r\nview of the earth so beautifully lit up.  In a word she has no\r\nmoon (applying this designation to our globe) but on one side of\r\nher disc.  Now if this were the case with the earth-- if, for\r\nexample, Europe never saw the moon, and she was only visible at\r\nthe antipodes, imagine to yourself the astonishment of a\r\nEuropean on arriving in Australia.\"\r\n\r\n\"They would make the voyage for nothing but to see the moon!\"\r\nreplied Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Very well!\" continued Barbicane, \"that astonishment is reserved\r\nfor the Selenites who inhabit the face of the moon opposite to\r\nthe earth, a face which is ever invisible to our countrymen of\r\nthe terrestrial globe.\"\r\n\r\n\"And which we should have seen,\" added Nicholl, \"if we had arrived\r\nhere when the moon was new, that is to say fifteen days later.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will add, to make amends,\" continued Barbicane, \"that the\r\ninhabitants of the visible face are singularly favored by nature,\r\nto the detriment of their brethren on the invisible face.\r\nThe latter, as you see, have dark nights of 354 hours, without\r\none single ray to break the darkness.  The other, on the contrary,\r\nwhen the sun which has given its light for fifteen days sinks\r\nbelow the horizon, see a splendid orb rise on the opposite horizon.\r\nIt is the earth, which is thirteen times greater than the\r\ndiminutive moon that we know-- the earth which developes itself\r\nat a diameter of two degrees, and which sheds a light thirteen\r\ntimes greater than that qualified by atmospheric strata-- the\r\nearth which only disappears at the moment when the sun reappears\r\nin its turn!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nicely worded!\" said Michel, \"slightly academical perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"It follows, then,\" continued Barbicane, without knitting his\r\nbrows, \"that the visible face of the disc must be very agreeable\r\nto inhabit, since it always looks on either the sun when the\r\nmoon is full, or on the earth when the moon is new.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Nicholl, \"that advantage must be well compensated by\r\nthe insupportable heat which the light brings with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The inconvenience, in that respect, is the same for the two\r\nfaces, for the earth's light is evidently deprived of heat.\r\nBut the invisible face is still more searched by the heat than\r\nthe visible face.  I say that for _you_, Nicholl, because Michel\r\nwill probably not understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" continued Barbicane, \"when the invisible face receives\r\nat the same time light and heat from the sun, it is because the\r\nmoon is new; that is to say, she is situated between the sun and\r\nthe earth.  It follows, then, considering the position which she\r\noccupies in opposition when full, that she is nearer to the sun\r\nby twice her distance from the earth; and that distance may be\r\nestimated at the two-hundredth part of that which separates the\r\nsun from the earth, or in round numbers 400,000 miles.  So that\r\ninvisible face is so much nearer to the sun when she receives\r\nits rays.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite right,\" replied Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary,\" continued Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"One moment,\" said Michel, interrupting his grave companion.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"I ask to be allowed to continue the explanation.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why?\"\r\n\r\n\"To prove that I understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get along with you,\" said Barbicane, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary,\" said Michel, imitating the tone and gestures\r\nof the president, \"on the contrary, when the visible face of the\r\nmoon is lit by the sun, it is because the moon is full, that is\r\nto say, opposite the sun with regard to the earth.  The distance\r\nseparating it from the radiant orb is then increased in round\r\nnumbers to 400,000 miles, and the heat which she receives must\r\nbe a little less.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well said!\" exclaimed Barbicane.  \"Do you know, Michel,\r\nthat, for an amateur, you are intelligent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Michel coolly, \"we are all so on the Boulevard\r\ndes Italiens.\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane gravely grasped the hand of his amiable companion, and\r\ncontinued to enumerate the advantages reserved for the inhabitants\r\nof the visible face.\r\n\r\nAmong others, he mentioned eclipses of the sun, which only take\r\nplace on this side of the lunar disc; since, in order that they\r\nmay take place, it is necessary for the moon to be _in\r\nopposition_.  These eclipses, caused by the interposition of the\r\nearth between the moon and the sun, can last _two hours_; during\r\nwhich time, by reason of the rays refracted by its atmosphere,\r\nthe terrestrial globe can appear as nothing but a black point\r\nupon the sun.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" said Nicholl, \"there is a hemisphere, that invisible\r\nhemisphere which is very ill supplied, very ill treated,\r\nby nature.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" replied Michel; \"if we ever become Selenites, we\r\nwill inhabit the visible face.  I like the light.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless, by any chance,\" answered Nicholl, \"the atmosphere should\r\nbe condensed on the other side, as certain astronomers pretend.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be a consideration,\" said Michel.\r\n\r\nBreakfast over, the observers returned to their post.  They tried\r\nto see through the darkened scuttles by extinguishing all light\r\nin the projectile; but not a luminous spark made its way through\r\nthe darkness.\r\n\r\nOne inexplicable fact preoccupied Barbicane.  Why, having passed\r\nwithin such a short distance of the moon--about twenty-five\r\nmiles only-- why the projectile had not fallen?  If its speed\r\nhad been enormous, he could have understood that the fall would\r\nnot have taken place; but, with a relatively moderate speed,\r\nthat resistance to the moon's attraction could not be explained.\r\nWas the projectile under some foreign influence?  Did some kind\r\nof body retain it in the ether?  It was quite evident that it\r\ncould never reach any point of the moon.  Whither was it going?\r\nWas it going farther from, or nearing, the disc?  Was it being\r\nborne in that profound darkness through the infinity of space?\r\nHow could they learn, how calculate, in the midst of this night?\r\nAll these questions made Barbicane uneasy, but he could not\r\nsolve them.\r\n\r\nCertainly, the invisible orb was _there_, perhaps only some few\r\nmiles off; but neither he nor his companions could see it.\r\nIf there was any noise on its surface, they could not hear it.\r\nAir, that medium of sound, was wanting to transmit the groanings\r\nof that moon which the Arabic legends call \"a man already half\r\ngranite, and still breathing.\"\r\n\r\nOne must allow that that was enough to aggravate the most\r\npatient observers.  It was just that unknown hemisphere which\r\nwas stealing from their sight.  That face which fifteen days\r\nsooner, or fifteen days later, had been, or would be, splendidly\r\nilluminated by the solar rays, was then being lost in utter darkness.\r\nIn fifteen days where would the projectile be?  Who could say?\r\nWhere would the chances of conflicting attractions have drawn\r\nit to?  The disappointment of the travelers in the midst of this\r\nutter darkness may be imagined.  All observation of the lunar\r\ndisc was impossible.  The constellations alone claimed all their\r\nattention; and we must allow that the astronomers Faye, Charconac,\r\nand Secchi, never found themselves in circumstances so favorable\r\nfor their observation.\r\n\r\nIndeed, nothing could equal the splendor of this starry world,\r\nbathed in limpid ether.  Its diamonds set in the heavenly vault\r\nsparkled magnificently.  The eye took in the firmament from the\r\nSouthern Cross to the North Star, those two constellations which\r\nin 12,000 years, by reason of the succession of equinoxes, will\r\nresign their part of the polar stars, the one to Canopus in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, the other to Wega in the northern.\r\nImagination loses itself in this sublime Infinity, amid which\r\nthe projectile was gravitating, like a new star created by the\r\nhand of man.  From a natural cause, these constellations shone\r\nwith a soft luster; they did not twinkle, for there was no\r\natmosphere which, by the intervention of its layers unequally\r\ndense and of different degrees of humidity, produces\r\nthis scintillation.  These stars were soft eyes, looking out\r\ninto the dark night, amid the silence of absolute space.\r\n\r\nLong did the travelers stand mute, watching the constellated\r\nfirmament, upon which the moon, like a vast screen, made an\r\nenormous black hole.  But at length a painful sensation drew\r\nthem from their watchings.  This was an intense cold, which soon\r\ncovered the inside of the glass of the scuttles with a thick\r\ncoating of ice.  The sun was no longer warming the projectile\r\nwith its direct rays, and thus it was losing the heat stored up\r\nin its walls by degrees.  This heat was rapidly evaporating into\r\nspace by radiation, and a considerably lower temperature was\r\nthe result.  The humidity of the interior was changed into ice\r\nupon contact with the glass, preventing all observation.\r\n\r\nNicholl consulted the thermometer, and saw that it had fallen to\r\nseventeen degrees (Centigrade) below zero. [3]  So that, in spite\r\nof the many reasons for economizing, Barbicane, after having\r\nbegged light from the gas, was also obliged to beg for heat.\r\nThe projectile's low temperature was no longer endurable.\r\nIts tenants would have been frozen to death.\r\n\r\n[3] 1@ Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" observed Michel, \"we cannot reasonably complain of the\r\nmonotony of our journey!  What variety we have had, at least\r\nin temperature.  Now we are blinded with light and saturated with\r\nheat, like the Indians of the Pampas! now plunged into profound\r\ndarkness, amid the cold, like the Esquimaux of the north pole.\r\nNo, indeed! we have no right to complain; nature does wonders in\r\nour honor.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" asked Nicholl, \"what is the temperature outside?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly that of the planetary space,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" continued Michel Ardan, \"would not this be the time to\r\nmake the experiment which we dared not attempt when we were\r\ndrowned in the sun's rays?\r\n\r\n\"It is now or never,\" replied Barbicane, \"for we are in a good\r\nposition to verify the temperature of space, and see if Fourier\r\nor Pouillet's calculations are exact.\"\r\n\r\n\"In any case it is cold,\" said Michel.  \"See! the steam of the\r\ninterior is condensing on the glasses of the scuttles.  If the fall\r\ncontinues, the vapor of our breath will fall in snow around us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us prepare a thermometer,\" said Barbicane.\r\n\r\nWe may imagine that an ordinary thermometer would afford no\r\nresult under the circumstances in which this instrument was to\r\nbe exposed.  The mercury would have been frozen in its ball,\r\nas below 42@ Fahrenheit below zero it is no longer liquid.\r\nBut Barbicane had furnished himself with a spirit thermometer\r\non Wafferdin's system, which gives the minima of excessively\r\nlow temperatures.\r\n\r\nBefore beginning the experiment, this instrument was compared\r\nwith an ordinary one, and then Barbicane prepared to use it.\r\n\r\n\"How shall we set about it?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is easier,\" replied Michel Ardan, who was never at a loss.\r\n\"We open the scuttle rapidly; throw out the instrument; it follows\r\nthe projectile with exemplary docility; and a quarter of an hour\r\nafter, draw it in.\"\r\n\r\n\"With the hand?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"With the hand,\" replied Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, my friend, do not expose yourself,\" answered\r\nBarbicane, \"for the hand that you draw in again will be nothing\r\nbut a stump frozen and deformed by the frightful cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really!\"\r\n\r\n\"You will feel as if you had had a terrible burn, like that of\r\niron at a white heat; for whether the heat leaves our bodies\r\nbriskly or enters briskly, it is exactly the same thing.\r\nBesides, I am not at all certain that the objects we have thrown\r\nout are still following us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Because, if we are passing through an atmosphere of the\r\nslightest density, these objects will be retarded.  Again, the\r\ndarkness prevents our seeing if they still float around us.\r\nBut in order not to expose ourselves to the loss of our\r\nthermometer, we will fasten it, and we can then more easily\r\npull it back again.\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane's advice was followed.  Through the scuttle rapidly\r\nopened, Nicholl threw out the instrument, which was held by a\r\nshort cord, so that it might be more easily drawn up.  The scuttle\r\nhad not been opened more than a second, but that second had sufficed\r\nto let in a most intense cold.\r\n\r\n\"The devil!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, \"it is cold enough to\r\nfreeze a white bear.\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane waited until half an hour had elapsed, which was more\r\nthan time enough to allow the instrument to fall to the level of\r\nthe surrounding temperature.  Then it was rapidly pulled in.\r\n\r\nBarbicane calculated the quantity of spirits of wine overflowed\r\ninto the little vial soldered to the lower part of the\r\ninstrument, and said:\r\n\r\n\"A hundred and forty degrees Centigrade [4] below zero!\"\r\n\r\n[4] 218 degrees Fahrenheit below zero.\r\n\r\nM. Pouillet was right and Fourier wrong.  That was the undoubted\r\ntemperature of the starry space.  Such is, perhaps, that of the\r\nlunar continents, when the orb of night has lost by radiation\r\nall the heat which fifteen days of sun have poured into her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPERBOLA OR PARABOLA\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may, perhaps, be astonished to find Barbicane and his\r\ncompanions so little occupied with the future reserved for them\r\nin their metal prison which was bearing them through the\r\ninfinity of space.  Instead of asking where they were going,\r\nthey passed their time making experiments, as if they had been\r\nquietly installed in their own study.\r\n\r\nWe might answer that men so strong-minded were above such\r\nanxieties-- that they did not trouble themselves about such\r\ntrifles-- and that they had something else to do than to\r\noccupy their minds with the future.\r\n\r\nThe truth was that they were not masters of their projectile;\r\nthey could neither check its course, nor alter its direction.\r\n\r\nA sailor can change the head of his ship as he pleases; an\r\naeronaut can give a vertical motion to his balloon.  They, on\r\nthe contrary, had no power over their vehicle.  Every maneuver\r\nwas forbidden.  Hence the inclination to let things alone, or as\r\nthe sailors say, \"let her run.\"\r\n\r\nWhere did they find themselves at this moment, at eight o'clock in\r\nthe morning of the day called upon the earth the 6th of December?\r\nVery certainly in the neighborhood of the moon, and even near\r\nenough for her to look to them like an enormous black screen upon\r\nthe firmament.  As to the distance which separated them, it was\r\nimpossible to estimate it.  The projectile, held by some\r\nunaccountable force, had been within four miles of grazing the\r\nsatellite's north pole.\r\n\r\nBut since entering the cone of shadow these last two hours, had\r\nthe distance increased or diminished?  Every point of mark was\r\nwanting by which to estimate both the direction and the speed of\r\nthe projectile.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was rapidly leaving the disc, so that it would soon\r\nquit the pure shadow.  Perhaps, again, on the other hand, it\r\nmight be nearing it so much that in a short time it might strike\r\nsome high point on the invisible hemisphere, which would doubtlessly\r\nhave ended the journey much to the detriment of the travelers.\r\n\r\nA discussion arose on this subject, and Michel Ardan, always\r\nready with an explanation, gave it as his opinion that the\r\nprojectile, held by the lunar attraction, would end by falling\r\non the surface of the terrestrial globe like an aerolite.\r\n\r\n\"First of all, my friend,\" answered Barbicane, \"every aerolite\r\ndoes not fall to the earth; it is only a small proportion which\r\ndo so; and if we had passed into an aerolite, it does not necessarily\r\nfollow that we should ever reach the surface of the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how if we get near enough?\" replied Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Pure mistake,\" replied Barbicane.  \"Have you not seen shooting\r\nstars rush through the sky by thousands at certain seasons?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, these stars, or rather corpuscles, only shine when they\r\nare heated by gliding over the atmospheric layers.  Now, if\r\nthey enter the atmosphere, they pass at least within forty\r\nmiles of the earth, but they seldom fall upon it.  The same with\r\nour projectile.  It may approach very near to the moon, and not\r\nyet fall upon it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But then,\" asked Michel, \"I shall be curious to know how our\r\nerring vehicle will act in space?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see but two hypotheses,\" replied Barbicane, after some\r\nmoments' reflection.\r\n\r\n\"What are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"The projectile has the choice between two mathematical curves,\r\nand it will follow one or the other according to the speed with\r\nwhich it is animated, and which at this moment I cannot estimate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Nicholl, \"it will follow either a parabola or\r\na hyperbola.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" replied Barbicane.  \"With a certain speed it will\r\nassume the parabola, and with a greater the hyperbola.\"\r\n\r\n\"I like those grand words,\" exclaimed Michel Ardan; \"one knows\r\ndirectly what they mean.  And pray what is your parabola, if\r\nyou please?\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend,\" answered the captain, \"the parabola is a curve of\r\nthe second order, the result of the section of a cone\r\nintersected by a plane parallel to one of the sides.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! ah!\" said Michel, in a satisfied tone.\r\n\r\n\"It is very nearly,\" continued Nicholl, \"the course described by\r\na bomb launched from a mortar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfect!  And the hyperbola?\"\r\n\r\n\"The hyperbola, Michel, is a curve of the second order, produced\r\nby the intersection of a conic surface and a plane parallel to\r\nits axis, and constitutes two branches separated one from the other,\r\nboth tending indefinitely in the two directions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan in a serious tone, as\r\nif they had told him of some serious event.  \"What I particularly\r\nlike in your definition of the hyperbola (I was going to say\r\nhyperblague) is that it is still more obscure than the word you\r\npretend to define.\"\r\n\r\nNicholl and Barbicane cared little for Michel Ardan's fun.\r\nThey were deep in a scientific discussion.  What curve would\r\nthe projectile follow? was their hobby.  One maintained the\r\nhyperbola, the other the parabola.  They gave each other reasons\r\nbristling with _x_.  Their arguments were couched in language\r\nwhich made Michel jump.  The discussion was hot, and neither\r\nwould give up his chosen curve to his adversary.\r\n\r\nThis scientific dispute lasted so long that it made Michel\r\nvery impatient.\r\n\r\n\"Now, gentlemen cosines, will you cease to throw parabolas and\r\nhyperbolas at each other's heads?  I want to understand the only\r\ninteresting question in the whole affair.  We shall follow one\r\nor the other of these curves?  Good.  But where will they lead\r\nus to?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nowhere,\" replied Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"How, nowhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Evidently,\" said Barbicane, \"they are open curves, which may be\r\nprolonged indefinitely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, savants!\" cried Michel; \"and what are either the one or the\r\nother to us from the moment we know that they equally lead us\r\ninto infinite space?\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane and Nicholl could not forbear smiling.  They had just\r\nbeen creating \"art for art's sake.\"  Never had so idle a question\r\nbeen raised at such an inopportune moment.  The sinister truth\r\nremained that, whether hyperbolically or parabolically borne away,\r\nthe projectile would never again meet either the earth or the moon.\r\n\r\nWhat would become of these bold travelers in the immediate future?\r\nIf they did not die of hunger, if they did not die of thirst,\r\nin some days, when the gas failed, they would die from want of air,\r\nunless the cold had killed them first.  Still, important as it was\r\nto economize the gas, the excessive lowness of the surrounding\r\ntemperature obliged them to consume a certain quantity.\r\nStrictly speaking, they could do without its _light_, but not\r\nwithout its _heat_.  Fortunately the caloric generated by Reiset's\r\nand Regnaut's apparatus raised the temperature of the interior\r\nof the projectile a little, and without much expenditure they\r\nwere able to keep it bearable.\r\n\r\nBut observations had now become very difficult.  the dampness of\r\nthe projectile was condensed on the windows and congealed immediately.\r\nThis cloudiness had to be dispersed continually.  In any case\r\nthey might hope to be able to discover some phenomena of the\r\nhighest interest.\r\n\r\nBut up to this time the disc remained dumb and dark.  It did not\r\nanswer the multiplicity of questions put by these ardent minds;\r\na matter which drew this reflection from Michel, apparently a\r\njust one:\r\n\r\n\"If ever we begin this journey over again, we shall do well to\r\nchoose the time when the moon is at the full.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Nicholl, \"that circumstance will be more favorable.\r\nI allow that the moon, immersed in the sun's rays, will not be\r\nvisible during the transit, but instead we should see the earth,\r\nwhich would be full.  And what is more, if we were drawn round the\r\nmoon, as at this moment, we should at least have the advantage of\r\nseeing the invisible part of her disc magnificently lit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well said, Nicholl,\" replied Michel Ardan.  \"What do you\r\nthink, Barbicane?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think this,\" answered the grave president:  \"If ever we begin\r\nthis journey again, we shall start at the same time and under\r\nthe same conditions.  Suppose we had attained our end, would it\r\nnot have been better to have found continents in broad daylight\r\nthan a country plunged in utter darkness?  Would not our first\r\ninstallation have been made under better circumstances?\r\nYes, evidently.  As to the invisible side, we could have visited\r\nit in our exploring expeditions on the lunar globe.  So that the\r\ntime of the full moon was well chosen.  But we ought to have\r\narrived at the end; and in order to have so arrived, we ought\r\nto have suffered no deviation on the road.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing to say to that,\" answered Michel Ardan.\r\n\"Here is, however, a good opportunity lost of observing the\r\nother side of the moon.\"\r\n\r\nBut the projectile was now describing in the shadow that\r\nincalculable course which no sight-mark would allow them\r\nto ascertain.  Had its direction been altered, either by the\r\ninfluence of the lunar attraction, or by the action of some\r\nunknown star?  Barbicane could not say.  But a change had taken\r\nplace in the relative position of the vehicle; and Barbicane\r\nverified it about four in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe change consisted in this, that the base of the projectile\r\nhad turned toward the moon's surface, and was so held by a\r\nperpendicular passing through its axis.  The attraction, that is\r\nto say the weight, had brought about this alteration.  The heaviest\r\npart of the projectile inclined toward the invisible disc as if it\r\nwould fall upon it.\r\n\r\nWas it falling?  Were the travelers attaining that much desired end?\r\nNo.  And the observation of a sign-point, quite inexplicable in\r\nitself, showed Barbicane that his projectile was not nearing the\r\nmoon, and that it had shifted by following an almost concentric curve.\r\n\r\nThis point of mark was a luminous brightness, which Nicholl\r\nsighted suddenly, on the limit of the horizon formed by the\r\nblack disc.  This point could not be confounded with a star.\r\nIt was a reddish incandescence which increased by degrees, a\r\ndecided proof that the projectile was shifting toward it and\r\nnot falling normally on the surface of the moon.\r\n\r\n\"A volcano! it is a volcano in action!\" cried Nicholl; \"a\r\ndisemboweling of the interior fires of the moon!  That world is\r\nnot quite extinguished.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, an eruption,\" replied Barbicane, who was carefully\r\nstudying the phenomenon through his night glass.  \"What should\r\nit be, if not a volcano?\"\r\n\r\n\"But, then,\" said Michel Ardan, \"in order to maintain that\r\ncombustion, there must be air.  So the atmosphere does surround\r\nthat part of the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps so,\" replied Barbicane, \"but not necessarily.\r\n\r\nThe volcano, by the decomposition of certain substances, can\r\nprovide its own oxygen, and thus throw flames into space.  It seems\r\nto me that the deflagration, by the intense brilliancy of the\r\nsubstances in combustion, is produced in pure oxygen.  We must\r\nnot be in a hurry to proclaim the existence of a lunar atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\nThe fiery mountain must have been situated about the 45@ south\r\nlatitude on the invisible part of the disc; but, to Barbicane's\r\ngreat displeasure, the curve which the projectile was describing\r\nwas taking it far from the point indicated by the eruption.\r\nThus he could not determine its nature exactly.  Half an hour\r\nafter being sighted, this luminous point had disappeared behind\r\nthe dark horizon; but the verification of this phenomenon was\r\nof considerable consequence in their selenographic studies.\r\nIt proved that all heat had not yet disappeared from the bowels\r\nof this globe; and where heat exists, who can affirm that the\r\nvegetable kingdom, nay, even the animal kingdom itself, has not\r\nup to this time resisted all destructive influences?  The existence\r\nof this volcano in eruption, unmistakably seen by these earthly\r\nsavants, would doubtless give rise to many theories favorable\r\nto the grave question of the habitability of the moon.\r\n\r\nBarbicane allowed himself to be carried away by these reflections.\r\nHe forgot himself in a deep reverie in which the mysterious\r\ndestiny of the lunar world was uppermost.  He was seeking to\r\ncombine together the facts observed up to that time, when a new\r\nincident recalled him briskly to reality.  This incident was more\r\nthan a cosmical phenomenon; it was a threatened danger, the\r\nconsequence of which might be disastrous in the extreme.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in the midst of the ether, in the profound darkness, an\r\nenormous mass appeared.  It was like a moon, but an incandescent\r\nmoon whose brilliancy was all the more intolerable as it cut\r\nsharply on the frightful darkness of space.  This mass, of a\r\ncircular form, threw a light which filled the projectile.\r\nThe forms of Barbicane, Nicholl, and Michel Ardan, bathed in\r\nits white sheets, assumed that livid spectral appearance which\r\nphysicians produce with the fictitious light of alcohol\r\nimpregnated with salt.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" cried Michel Ardan, \"we are hideous.  What is that\r\nill-conditioned moon?\"\r\n\r\n\"A meteor,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"A meteor burning in space?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nThis shooting globe suddenly appearing in shadow at a distance\r\nof at most 200 miles, ought, according to Barbicane, to have a\r\ndiameter of 2,000 yards.  It advanced at a speed of about one\r\nmile and a half per second.  It cut the projectile's path and\r\nmust reach it in some minutes.  As it approached it grew to\r\nenormous proportions.\r\n\r\nImagine, if possible, the situation of the travelers!  It is\r\nimpossible to describe it.  In spite of their courage, their\r\n_sang-froid_, their carelessness of danger, they were mute,\r\nmotionless with stiffened limbs, a prey to frightful terror.\r\nTheir projectile, the course of which they could not alter, was\r\nrushing straight on this ignited mass, more intense than the\r\nopen mouth of an oven.  It seemed as though they were being\r\nprecipitated toward an abyss of fire.\r\n\r\nBarbicane had seized the hands of his two companions, and all\r\nthree looked through their half-open eyelids upon that asteroid\r\nheated to a white heat.  If thought was not destroyed within\r\nthem, if their brains still worked amid all this awe, they must\r\nhave given themselves up for lost.\r\n\r\nTwo minutes after the sudden appearance of the meteor (to them\r\ntwo centuries of anguish) the projectile seemed almost about to\r\nstrike it, when the globe of fire burst like a bomb, but without\r\nmaking any noise in that void where sound, which is but the\r\nagitation of the layers of air, could not be generated.\r\n\r\nNicholl uttered a cry, and he and his companions rushed to\r\nthe scuttle.  What a sight!  What pen can describe it?\r\nWhat palette is rich enough in colors to reproduce so magnificent\r\na spectacle?\r\n\r\nIt was like the opening of a crater, like the scattering of an\r\nimmense conflagration.  Thousands of luminous fragments lit up\r\nand irradiated space with their fires.  Every size, every color,\r\nwas there intermingled.  There were rays of yellow and pale\r\nyellow, red, green, gray-- a crown of fireworks of all colors.\r\nOf the enormous and much-dreaded globe there remained nothing\r\nbut these fragments carried in all directions, now become\r\nasteroids in their turn, some flaming like a sword, some\r\nsurrounded by a whitish cloud, and others leaving behind them\r\ntrains of brilliant cosmical dust.\r\n\r\nThese incandescent blocks crossed and struck each other,\r\nscattering still smaller fragments, some of which struck\r\nthe projectile.  Its left scuttle was even cracked by a\r\nviolent shock.  It seemed to be floating amid a hail of\r\nhowitzer shells, the smallest of which might destroy\r\nit instantly.\r\n\r\nThe light which saturated the ether was so wonderfully intense,\r\nthat Michel, drawing Barbicane and Nicholl to his window,\r\nexclaimed, \"The invisible moon, visible at last!\"\r\n\r\nAnd through a luminous emanation, which lasted some seconds, the\r\nwhole three caught a glimpse of that mysterious disc which the eye\r\nof man now saw for the first time.  What could they distinguish\r\nat a distance which they could not estimate?  Some lengthened\r\nbands along the disc, real clouds formed in the midst of a very\r\nconfined atmosphere, from which emerged not only all the mountains,\r\nbut also projections of less importance; its circles, its yawning\r\ncraters, as capriciously placed as on the visible surface.\r\nThen immense spaces, no longer arid plains, but real seas, oceans,\r\nwidely distributed, reflecting on their liquid surface all the\r\ndazzling magic of the fires of space; and, lastly, on the surface\r\nof the continents, large dark masses, looking like immense forests\r\nunder the rapid illumination of a brilliance.\r\n\r\nWas it an illusion, a mistake, an optical illusion?  Could they\r\ngive a scientific assent to an observation so superficially obtained?\r\nDared they pronounce upon the question of its habitability after\r\nso slight a glimpse of the invisible disc?\r\n\r\nBut the lightnings in space subsided by degrees; its accidental\r\nbrilliancy died away; the asteroids dispersed in different\r\ndirections and were extinguished in the distance.\r\n\r\nThe ether returned to its accustomed darkness; the stars, eclipsed\r\nfor a moment, again twinkled in the firmament, and the disc, so\r\nhastily discerned, was again buried in impenetrable night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe projectile had just escaped a terrible danger, and a very\r\nunforseen one.  Who would have thought of such an encounter\r\nwith meteors?  These erring bodies might create serious perils\r\nfor the travelers.  They were to them so many sandbanks upon\r\nthat sea of ether which, less fortunate than sailors, they could\r\nnot escape.  But did these adventurers complain of space?  No, not\r\nsince nature had given them the splendid sight of a cosmical\r\nmeteor bursting from expansion, since this inimitable firework,\r\nwhich no Ruggieri could imitate, had lit up for some seconds the\r\ninvisible glory of the moon.  In that flash, continents, seas,\r\nand forests had become visible to them.  Did an atmosphere,\r\nthen, bring to this unknown face its life-giving atoms?\r\nQuestions still insoluble, and forever closed against\r\nhuman curiousity!\r\n\r\nIt was then half-past three in the afternoon.  The projectile\r\nwas following its curvilinear direction round the moon.  Had its\r\ncourse again been altered by the meteor?  It was to be feared so.\r\nBut the projectile must describe a curve unalterably determined\r\nby the laws of mechanical reasoning.  Barbicane was inclined to\r\nbelieve that this curve would be rather a parabola than a hyperbola.\r\nBut admitting the parabola, the projectile must quickly have\r\npassed through the cone of shadow projected into space opposite\r\nthe sun.  This cone, indeed, is very narrow, the angular diameter\r\nof the moon being so little when compared with the diameter of\r\nthe orb of day; and up to this time the projectile had been\r\nfloating in this deep shadow.  Whatever had been its speed\r\n(and it could not have been insignificant), its period of\r\noccultation continued.  That was evident, but perhaps that would\r\nnot have been the case in a supposedly rigidly parabolical\r\ntrajectory-- a new problem which tormented Barbicane's brain,\r\nimprisoned as he was in a circle of unknowns which he could\r\nnot unravel.\r\n\r\nNeither of the travelers thought of taking an instant's repose.\r\nEach one watched for an unexpected fact, which might throw some\r\nnew light on their uranographic studies.  About five o'clock,\r\nMichel Ardan distributed, under the name of dinner, some pieces\r\nof bread and cold meat, which were quickly swallowed without\r\neither of them abandoning their scuttle, the glass of which was\r\nincessantly encrusted by the condensation of vapor.\r\n\r\nAbout forty-five minutes past five in the evening, Nicholl,\r\narmed with his glass, sighted toward the southern border of the\r\nmoon, and in the direction followed by the projectile, some\r\nbright points cut upon the dark shield of the sky.  They looked\r\nlike a succession of sharp points lengthened into a tremulous line.\r\nThey were very bright.  Such appeared the terminal line of the\r\nmoon when in one of her octants.\r\n\r\nThey could not be mistaken.  It was no longer a simple meteor.\r\nThis luminous ridge had neither color nor motion.  Nor was it a\r\nvolcano in eruption.  And Barbicane did not hesitate to\r\npronounce upon it.\r\n\r\n\"The sun!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"What! the sun?\" answered Nicholl and Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my friends, it is the radiant orb itself lighting up the\r\nsummit of the mountains situated on the southern borders of\r\nthe moon.  We are evidently nearing the south pole.\"\r\n\r\n\"After having passed the north pole,\" replied Michel.  \"We have\r\nmade the circuit of our satellite, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my good Michel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, no more hyperbolas, no more parabolas, no more open\r\ncurves to fear?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but a closed curve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which is called----\"\r\n\r\n\"An ellipse.  Instead of losing itself in interplanetary space,\r\nit is probable that the projectile will describe an elliptical\r\norbit around the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"And that it will become _her_ satellite.\"\r\n\r\n\"Moon of the moon!\" cried Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"Only, I would have you observe, my worthy friend,\" replied\r\nBarbicane, \"that we are none the less lost for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, in another manner, and much more pleasantly,\" answered the\r\ncareless Frenchman with his most amiable smile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nTYCHO\r\n\r\n\r\nAt six in the evening the projectile passed the south pole at\r\nless than forty miles off, a distance equal to that already\r\nreached at the north pole.  The elliptical curve was being\r\nrigidly carried out.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the travelers once more entered the blessed rays\r\nof the sun.  They saw once more those stars which move slowly\r\nfrom east to west.  The radiant orb was saluted by a triple hurrah.\r\nWith its light it also sent heat, which soon pierced the metal walls.\r\nThe glass resumed its accustomed appearance.  The layers of ice\r\nmelted as if by enchantment; and immediately, for economy's sake,\r\nthe gas was put out, the air apparatus alone consuming its\r\nusual quantity.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Nicholl, \"these rays of heat are good.  With what\r\nimpatience must the Selenites wait the reappearance of the orb\r\nof day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Michel Ardan, \"imbibing as it were the brilliant\r\nether, light and heat, all life is contained in them.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the bottom of the projectile deviated somewhat\r\nfrom the lunar surface, in order to follow the slightly\r\nlengthened elliptical orbit.  From this point, had the earth\r\nbeen at the full, Barbicane and his companions could have\r\nseen it, but immersed in the sun's irradiation she was\r\nquite invisible.  Another spectacle attracted their attention,\r\nthat of the southern part of the moon, brought by the glasses\r\nto within 450 yards.  They did not again leave the scuttles,\r\nand noted every detail of this fantastical continent.\r\n\r\nMounts Doerful and Leibnitz formed two separate groups very near\r\nthe south pole.  The first group extended from the pole to the\r\neighty-fourth parallel, on the eastern part of the orb; the\r\nsecond occupied the eastern border, extending from the 65@ of\r\nlatitude to the pole.\r\n\r\nOn their capriciously formed ridge appeared dazzling sheets, as\r\nmentioned by Pere Secchi.  With more certainty than the\r\nillustrious Roman astronomer, Barbicane was enabled to recognize\r\ntheir nature.\r\n\r\n\"They are snow,\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Snow?\" repeated Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Nicholl, snow; the surface of which is deeply frozen.\r\nSee how they reflect the luminous rays.  Cooled lava would never\r\ngive out such intense reflection.  There must then be water,\r\nthere must be air on the moon.  As little as you please, but the\r\nfact can no longer be contested.\"  No, it could not be.  And if\r\never Barbicane should see the earth again, his notes will bear\r\nwitness to this great fact in his selenographic observations.\r\n\r\nThese mountains of Doerful and Leibnitz rose in the midst of\r\nplains of a medium extent, which were bounded by an indefinite\r\nsuccession of circles and annular ramparts.  These two chains\r\nare the only ones met with in this region of circles.\r\nComparatively but slightly marked, they throw up here and there\r\nsome sharp points, the highest summit of which attains an\r\naltitude of 24,600 feet.\r\n\r\nBut the projectile was high above all this landscape, and the\r\nprojections disappeared in the intense brilliancy of the disc.\r\nAnd to the eyes of the travelers there reappeared that original\r\naspect of the lunar landscapes, raw in tone, without gradation\r\nof colors, and without degrees of shadow, roughly black and\r\nwhite, from the want of diffusion of light.\r\n\r\nBut the sight of this desolate world did not fail to captivate\r\nthem by its very strangeness.  They were moving over this region\r\nas if they had been borne on the breath of some storm, watching\r\nheights defile under their feet, piercing the cavities with their\r\neyes, going down into the rifts, climbing the ramparts, sounding\r\nthese mysterious holes, and leveling all cracks.  But no trace\r\nof vegetation, no appearance of cities; nothing but stratification,\r\nbeds of lava, overflowings polished like immense mirrors,\r\nreflecting the sun's rays with overpowering brilliancy.\r\nNothing belonging to a _living_ world-- everything to a dead\r\nworld, where avalanches, rolling from the summits of the mountains,\r\nwould disperse noiselessly at the bottom of the abyss, retaining\r\nthe motion, but wanting the sound.  In any case it was the image\r\nof death, without its being possible even to say that life had ever\r\nexisted there.\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan, however, thought he recognized a heap of ruins,\r\nto which he drew Barbicane's attention.  It was about the 80th\r\nparallel, in 30@ longitude.  This heap of stones, rather\r\nregularly placed, represented a vast fortress, overlooking a\r\nlong rift, which in former days had served as a bed to the\r\nrivers of prehistorical times.  Not far from that, rose to a\r\nheight of 17,400 feet the annular mountain of Short, equal to\r\nthe Asiatic Caucasus.  Michel Ardan, with his accustomed ardor,\r\nmaintained \"the evidences\" of his fortress.  Beneath it he\r\ndiscerned the dismantled ramparts of a town; here the still\r\nintact arch of a portico, there two or three columns lying under\r\ntheir base; farther on, a succession of arches which must have\r\nsupported the conduit of an aqueduct; in another part the sunken\r\npillars of a gigantic bridge, run into the thickest parts of\r\nthe rift.  He distinguished all this, but with so much imagination\r\nin his glance, and through glasses so fantastical, that we must\r\nmistrust his observation.  But who could affirm, who would dare\r\nto say, that the amiable fellow did not really see that which\r\nhis two companions would not see?\r\n\r\nMoments were too precious to be sacrificed in idle discussion.\r\nThe selenite city, whether imaginary or not, had already\r\ndisappeared afar off.  The distance of the projectile from the\r\nlunar disc was on the increase, and the details of the soil were\r\nbeing lost in a confused jumble.  The reliefs, the circles,\r\nthe craters, and the plains alone remained, and still showed\r\ntheir boundary lines distinctly.  At this moment, to the left,\r\nlay extended one of the finest circles of lunar orography,\r\none of the curiosities of this continent.  It was Newton,\r\nwhich Barbicane recognized without trouble, by referring to\r\nthe _Mappa Selenographica_.\r\n\r\nNewton is situated in exactly 77@ south latitude, and 16@\r\neast longitude.  It forms an annular crater, the ramparts of\r\nwhich, rising to a height of 21,300 feet, seemed to be impassable.\r\n\r\nBarbicane made his companions observe that the height of this\r\nmountain above the surrounding plain was far from equaling the\r\ndepth of its crater.  This enormous hole was beyond all\r\nmeasurement, and formed a gloomy abyss, the bottom of which the\r\nsun's rays could never reach.  There, according to Humboldt,\r\nreigns utter darkness, which the light of the sun and the earth\r\ncannot break.  Mythologists could well have made it the mouth of hell.\r\n\r\n\"Newton,\" said Barbicane, \"is the most perfect type of these\r\nannular mountains, of which the earth possesses no sample.\r\nThey prove that the moon's formation, by means of cooling, is\r\ndue to violent causes; for while, under the pressure of internal\r\nfires the reliefs rise to considerable height, the depths withdraw\r\nfar below the lunar level.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not dispute the fact,\" replied Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\nSome minutes after passing Newton, the projectile directly\r\noverlooked the annular mountains of Moret.  It skirted at some\r\ndistance the summits of Blancanus, and at about half-past seven\r\nin the evening reached the circle of Clavius.\r\n\r\nThis circle, one of the most remarkable of the disc, is situated\r\nin 58@ south latitude, and 15@ east longitude.  Its height is\r\nestimated at 22,950 feet.  The travelers, at a distance of\r\ntwenty-four miles (reduced to four by their glasses) could\r\nadmire this vast crater in its entirety.\r\n\r\n\"Terrestrial volcanoes,\" said Barbicane, \"are but mole-hills\r\ncompared with those of the moon.  Measuring the old craters\r\nformed by the first eruptions of Vesuvius and Etna, we find them\r\nlittle more than three miles in breadth.  In France the circle\r\nof Cantal measures six miles across; at Ceyland the circle of\r\nthe island is forty miles, which is considered the largest on\r\nthe globe.  What are these diameters against that of Clavius,\r\nwhich we overlook at this moment?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is its breadth?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"It is 150 miles,\" replied Barbicane.  \"This circle is certainly\r\nthe most important on the moon, but many others measure 150,\r\n100, or 75 miles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! my friends,\" exclaimed Michel, \"can you picture to\r\nyourselves what this now peaceful orb of night must have been\r\nwhen its craters, filled with thunderings, vomited at the same\r\ntime smoke and tongues of flame.  What a wonderful spectacle\r\nthen, and now what decay!  This moon is nothing more than a thin\r\ncarcase of fireworks, whose squibs, rockets, serpents, and suns,\r\nafter a superb brilliancy, have left but sadly broken cases.\r\nWho can say the cause, the reason, the motive force of\r\nthese cataclysms?\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane was not listening to Michel Ardan; he was\r\ncontemplating these ramparts of Clavius, formed by large\r\nmountains spread over several miles.  At the bottom of the\r\nimmense cavity burrowed hundreds of small extinguished craters,\r\nriddling the soil like a colander, and overlooked by a peak\r\n15,000 feet high.\r\n\r\nAround the plain appeared desolate.  Nothing so arid as these\r\nreliefs, nothing so sad as these ruins of mountains, and (if we\r\nmay so express ourselves) these fragments of peaks and mountains\r\nwhich strewed the soil.  The satellite seemed to have burst at\r\nthis spot.\r\n\r\nThe projectile was still advancing, and this movement did\r\nnot subside.  Circles, craters, and uprooted mountains succeeded\r\neach other incessantly.  No more plains; no more seas.  A never\r\nending Switzerland and Norway.  And lastly, in the canter of\r\nthis region of crevasses, the most splendid mountain on the\r\nlunar disc, the dazzling Tycho, in which posterity will ever\r\npreserve the name of the illustrious Danish astronomer.\r\n\r\nIn observing the full moon in a cloudless sky no one has failed\r\nto remark this brilliant point of the southern hemisphere.\r\nMichel Ardan used every metaphor that his imagination could\r\nsupply to designate it by.  To him this Tycho was a focus of\r\nlight, a center of irradiation, a crater vomiting rays.  It was\r\nthe tire of a brilliant wheel, an _asteria_ enclosing the disc\r\nwith its silver tentacles, an enormous eye filled with flames,\r\na glory carved for Pluto's head, a star launched by the\r\nCreator's hand, and crushed against the face of the moon!\r\n\r\nTycho forms such a concentration of light that the inhabitants\r\nof the earth can see it without glasses, though at a distance\r\nof 240,000 miles!  Imagine, then, its intensity to the eye of\r\nobservers placed at a distance of only fifty miles!  Seen through\r\nthis pure ether, its brilliancy was so intolerable that Barbicane\r\nand his friends were obliged to blacken their glasses with the gas\r\nsmoke before they could bear the splendor.  Then silent, scarcely\r\nuttering an interjection of admiration, they gazed, they contemplated.\r\nAll their feelings, all their impressions, were concentrated in that\r\nlook, as under any violent emotion all life is concentrated at the heart.\r\n\r\nTycho belongs to the system of radiating mountains, like\r\nAristarchus and Copernicus; but it is of all the most complete\r\nand decided, showing unquestionably the frightful volcanic\r\naction to which the formation of the moon is due.  Tycho is\r\nsituated in 43@ south latitude, and 12@ east longitude.  Its center\r\nis occupied by a crater fifty miles broad.  It assumes a slightly\r\nelliptical form, and is surrounded by an enclosure of annular\r\nramparts, which on the east and west overlook the outer plain from\r\na height of 15,000 feet.  It is a group of Mont Blancs, placed\r\nround one common center and crowned by radiating beams.\r\n\r\nWhat this incomparable mountain really is, with all the\r\nprojections converging toward it, and the interior excrescences\r\nof its crater, photography itself could never represent.\r\nIndeed, it is during the full moon that Tycho is seen in all\r\nits splendor.  Then all shadows disappear, the foreshortening\r\nof perspective disappears, and all proofs become white-- a\r\ndisagreeable fact:  for this strange region would have been\r\nmarvelous if reproduced with photographic exactness.  It is\r\nbut a group of hollows, craters, circles, a network of crests;\r\nthen, as far as the eye could see, a whole volcanic network\r\ncast upon this encrusted soil.  One can then understand that\r\nthe bubbles of this central eruption have kept their first form.\r\nCrystallized by cooling, they have stereotyped that aspect\r\nwhich the moon formerly presented when under the Plutonian forces.\r\n\r\nThe distance which separated the travelers from the annular\r\nsummits of Tycho was not so great but that they could catch\r\nthe principal details.  Even on the causeway forming the\r\nfortifications of Tycho, the mountains hanging on to the\r\ninterior and exterior sloping flanks rose in stories like\r\ngigantic terraces.  They appeared to be higher by 300 or 400\r\nfeet to the west than to the east.  No system of terrestrial\r\nencampment could equal these natural fortifications.  A town\r\nbuilt at the bottom of this circular cavity would have been\r\nutterly inaccessible.\r\n\r\nInaccessible and wonderfully extended over this soil covered\r\nwith picturesque projections!  Indeed, nature had not left the\r\nbottom of this crater flat and empty.  It possessed its own\r\npeculiar orography, a mountainous system, making it a world\r\nin itself.  The travelers could distinguish clearly cones,\r\ncentral hills, remarkable positions of the soil, naturally\r\nplaced to receive the _chefs-d'oeuvre_ of Selenite architecture.\r\nThere was marked out the place for a temple, here the ground of a\r\nforum, on this spot the plan of a palace, in another the plateau\r\nfor a citadel; the whole overlooked by a central mountain of\r\n1,500 feet.  A vast circle, in which ancient Rome could have\r\nbeen held in its entirety ten times over.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, enthusiastic at the sight; \"what\r\na grand town might be constructed within that ring of mountains!\r\nA quiet city, a peaceful refuge, beyond all human misery.  How calm\r\nand isolated those misanthropes, those haters of humanity might\r\nlive there, and all who have a distaste for social life!\"\r\n\r\n\"All!  It would be too small for them,\" replied Barbicane simply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAVE QUESTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the projectile had passed the _enceinte_ of Tycho, and\r\nBarbicane and his two companions watched with scrupulous\r\nattention the brilliant rays which the celebrated mountain shed\r\nso curiously over the horizon.\r\n\r\nWhat was this radiant glory?  What geological phenomenon had\r\ndesigned these ardent beams?  This question occupied Barbicane's mind.\r\n\r\nUnder his eyes ran in all directions luminous furrows, raised at\r\nthe edges and concave in the center, some twelve miles, others\r\nthirty miles broad.  These brilliant trains extended in some\r\nplaces to within 600 miles of Tycho, and seemed to cover,\r\nparticularly toward the east, the northeast and the north, the\r\nhalf of the southern hemisphere.  One of these jets extended as\r\nfar as the circle of Neander, situated on the 40th meridian.\r\nAnother, by a slight curve, furrowed the \"Sea of Nectar,\" breaking\r\nagainst the chain of Pyrenees, after a circuit of 800 miles.\r\nOthers, toward the west, covered the \"Sea of Clouds\" and\r\nthe \"Sea of Humors\" with a luminous network.  What was the\r\norigin of these sparkling rays, which shone on the plains as\r\nwell as on the reliefs, at whatever height they might be?\r\nAll started from a common center, the crater of Tycho.\r\nThey sprang from him.  Herschel attributed their brilliancy to\r\ncurrents of lava congealed by the cold; an opinion, however,\r\nwhich has not been generally adopted.  Other astronomers have\r\nseen in these inexplicable rays a kind of moraines, rows of\r\nerratic blocks, which had been thrown up at the period of\r\nTycho's formation.\r\n\r\n\"And why not?\" asked Nicholl of Barbicane, who was relating and\r\nrejecting these different opinions.\r\n\r\n\"Because the regularity of these luminous lines, and the\r\nviolence necessary to carry volcanic matter to such distances,\r\nis inexplicable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh! by Jove!\" replied Michel Ardan, \"it seems easy enough to me\r\nto explain the origin of these rays.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed?\" said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" continued Michel.  \"It is enough to say that it is a\r\nvast star, similar to that produced by a ball or a stone thrown\r\nat a square of glass!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" replied Barbicane, smiling.  \"And what hand would be\r\npowerful enough to throw a ball to give such a shock as that?\"\r\n\r\n\"The hand is not necessary,\" answered Nicholl, not at all\r\nconfounded; \"and as to the stone, let us suppose it to be a comet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! those much-abused comets!\" exclaimed Barbicane.  \"My brave\r\nMichel, your explanation is not bad; but your comet is useless.\r\nThe shock which produced that rent must have some from the\r\ninside of the star.  A violent contraction of the lunar crust,\r\nwhile cooling, might suffice to imprint this gigantic star.\"\r\n\r\n\"A contraction! something like a lunar stomach-ache.\" said\r\nMichel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" added Barbicane, \"this opinion is that of an English\r\nsavant, Nasmyth, and it seems to me to sufficiently explain the\r\nradiation of these mountains.\"\r\n\r\n\"That Nasmyth was no fool!\" replied Michel.\r\n\r\nLong did the travelers, whom such a sight could never weary,\r\nadmire the splendors of Tycho.  Their projectile, saturated with\r\nluminous gleams in the double irradiation of sun and moon, must\r\nhave appeared like an incandescent globe.  They had passed\r\nsuddenly from excessive cold to intense heat.  Nature was thus\r\npreparing them to become Selenites.  Become Selenites!  That idea\r\nbrought up once more the question of the habitability of the moon.\r\nAfter what they had seen, could the travelers solve it?  Would they\r\ndecide for or against it?  Michel Ardan persuaded his two friends\r\nto form an opinion, and asked them directly if they thought that\r\nmen and animals were represented in the lunar world.\r\n\r\n\"I think that we can answer,\" said Barbicane; \"but according to\r\nmy idea the question ought not to be put in that form.  I ask it\r\nto be put differently.\"\r\n\r\n\"Put it your own way,\" replied Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Here it is,\" continued Barbicane.  \"The problem is a double one,\r\nand requires a double solution.  Is the moon _habitable_?  Has the\r\nmoon ever been _inhabitable_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" replied Nicholl.  \"First let us see whether the moon\r\nis habitable.\"\r\n\r\n\"To tell the truth, I know nothing about it,\" answered Michel.\r\n\r\n\"And I answer in the negative,\" continued Barbicane.  \"In her\r\nactual state, with her surrounding atmosphere certainly very\r\nmuch reduced, her seas for the most part dried up, her\r\ninsufficient supply of water restricted, vegetation, sudden\r\nalternations of cold and heat, her days and nights of 354\r\nhours-- the moon does not seem habitable to me, nor does she\r\nseem propitious to animal development, nor sufficient for the\r\nwants of existence as we understand it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Agreed,\" replied Nicholl.  \"But is not the moon habitable for\r\ncreatures differently organized from ourselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"That question is more difficult to answer, but I will try; and\r\nI ask Nicholl if _motion_ appears to him to be a necessary\r\nresult of _life_, whatever be its organization?\"\r\n\r\n\"Without a doubt!\" answered Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Then, my worthy companion, I would answer that we have observed\r\nthe lunar continent at a distance of 500 yards at most, and that\r\nnothing seemed to us to move on the moon's surface.  The presence\r\nof any kind of life would have been betrayed by its attendant marks,\r\nsuch as divers buildings, and even by ruins.  And what have\r\nwe seen?  Everywhere and always the geological works of nature,\r\nnever the work of man.  If, then, there exist representatives\r\nof the animal kingdom on the moon, they must have fled to those\r\nunfathomable cavities which the eye cannot reach; which I cannot\r\nadmit, for they must have left traces of their passage on those\r\nplains which the atmosphere must cover, however slightly raised\r\nit may be.  These traces are nowhere visible.  There remains but\r\none hypothesis, that of a living race to which motion, which is\r\nlife, is foreign.\"\r\n\r\n\"One might as well say, living creatures which do not live,\"\r\nreplied Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" said Barbicane, \"which for us has no meaning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we may form our opinion?\" said Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" continued Michel Ardan, \"the Scientific Commission\r\nassembled in the projectile of the Gun Club, after having\r\nfounded their argument on facts recently observed, decide\r\nunanimously upon the question of the habitability of the moon--\r\n`_No!_ the moon is not habitable.'\"\r\n\r\nThis decision was consigned by President Barbicane to his\r\nnotebook, where the process of the sitting of the 6th of\r\nDecember may be seen.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Nicholl, \"let us attack the second question, an\r\nindispensable complement of the first.  I ask the honorable\r\ncommission, if the moon is not habitable, has she ever been\r\ninhabited, Citizen Barbicane?\"\r\n\r\n\"My friends,\" replied Barbicane, \"I did not undertake this\r\njourney in order to form an opinion on the past habitability of\r\nour satellite; but I will add that our personal observations\r\nonly confirm me in this opinion.  I believe, indeed I affirm,\r\nthat the moon has been inhabited by a human race organized like\r\nour own; that she has produced animals anatomically formed like\r\nthe terrestrial animals:  but I add that these races, human and\r\nanimal, have had their day, and are now forever extinct!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" asked Michel, \"the moon must be older than the earth?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" said Barbicane decidedly, \"but a world which has grown old\r\nquicker, and whose formation and deformation have been more rapid.\r\nRelatively, the organizing force of matter has been much more\r\nviolent in the interior of the moon than in the interior of the\r\nterrestrial globe.  The actual state of this cracked, twisted,\r\nand burst disc abundantly proves this.  The moon and the earth\r\nwere nothing but gaseous masses originally.  These gases have\r\npassed into a liquid state under different influences, and the\r\nsolid masses have been formed later. But most certainly our\r\nsphere was still gaseous or liquid, when the moon was solidified\r\nby cooling, and had become habitable.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe it,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" continued Barbicane, \"an atmosphere surrounded it, the\r\nwaters contained within this gaseous envelope could not evaporate.\r\nUnder the influence of air, water, light, solar heat, and central\r\nheat, vegetation took possession of the continents prepared to\r\nreceive it, and certainly life showed itself about this period,\r\nfor nature does not expend herself in vain; and a world so\r\nwonderfully formed for habitation must necessarily be inhabited.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Nicholl, \"many phenomena inherent in our satellite\r\nmight cramp the expansion of the animal and vegetable kingdom.\r\nFor example, its days and nights of 354 hours?\"\r\n\r\n\"At the terrestrial poles they last six months,\" said Michel.\r\n\r\n\"An argument of little value, since the poles are not inhabited.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us observe, my friends,\" continued Barbicane, \"that if in\r\nthe actual state of the moon its long nights and long days\r\ncreated differences of temperature insupportable to\r\norganization, it was not so at the historical period of time.\r\nThe atmosphere enveloped the disc with a fluid mantle; vapor\r\ndeposited itself in the shape of clouds; this natural screen\r\ntempered the ardor of the solar rays, and retained the\r\nnocturnal radiation.  Light, like heat, can diffuse itself in\r\nthe air; hence an equality between the influences which no longer\r\nexists, now that atmosphere has almost entirely disappeared.\r\nAnd now I am going to astonish you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Astonish us?\" said Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"I firmly believe that at the period when the moon was inhabited,\r\nthe nights and days did not last 354 hours!\"\r\n\r\n\"And why?\" asked Nicholl quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Because most probably then the rotary motion of the moon upon\r\nher axis was not equal to her revolution, an equality which\r\npresents each part of her disc during fifteen days to the action\r\nof the solar rays.\"\r\n\r\n\"Granted,\" replied Nicholl, \"but why should not these two\r\nmotions have been equal, as they are really so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because that equality has only been determined by\r\nterrestrial attraction.  And who can say that this attraction\r\nwas powerful enough to alter the motion of the moon at that\r\nperiod when the earth was still fluid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" replied Nicholl; \"and who can say that the moon has\r\nalways been a satellite of the earth?\"\r\n\r\n\"And who can say,\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, \"that the moon did\r\nnot exist before the earth?\"\r\n\r\nTheir imaginations carried them away into an indefinite field\r\nof hypothesis.  Barbicane sought to restrain them.\r\n\r\n\"Those speculations are too high,\" said he; \"problems\r\nutterly insoluble.  Do not let us enter upon them.  Let us only\r\nadmit the insufficiency of the primordial attraction; and then\r\nby the inequality of the two motions of rotation and revolution,\r\nthe days and nights could have succeeded each other on the moon\r\nas they succeed each other on the earth.  Besides, even without\r\nthese conditions, life was possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so,\" asked Michel Ardan, \"humanity has disappeared from\r\nthe moon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Barbicane, \"after having doubtless remained\r\npersistently for millions of centuries; by degrees the\r\natmosphere becoming rarefied, the disc became uninhabitable, as\r\nthe terrestrial globe will one day become by cooling.\"\r\n\r\n\"By cooling?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied Barbicane; \"as the internal fires became\r\nextinguished, and the incandescent matter concentrated itself,\r\nthe lunar crust cooled.  By degrees the consequences of these\r\nphenomena showed themselves in the disappearance of organized\r\nbeings, and by the disappearance of vegetation.  Soon the\r\natmosphere was rarefied, probably withdrawn by terrestrial\r\nattraction; then aerial departure of respirable air, and\r\ndisappearance of water by means of evaporation.  At this period\r\nthe moon becoming uninhabitable, was no longer inhabited.\r\nIt was a dead world, such as we see it to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you say that the same fate is in store for the earth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most probably.\"\r\n\r\n\"But when?\"\r\n\r\n\"When the cooling of its crust shall have made it uninhabitable.\"\r\n\r\n\"And have they calculated the time which our unfortunate sphere\r\nwill take to cool?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you know these calculations?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly.\"\r\n\r\n\"But speak, then, my clumsy savant,\" exclaimed Michel Ardan,\r\n\"for you make me boil with impatience!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, my good Michel,\" replied Barbicane quietly; \"we know\r\nwhat diminution of temperature the earth undergoes in the lapse\r\nof a century.  And according to certain calculations, this mean\r\ntemperature will after a period of 400,000 years, be brought\r\ndown to zero!\"\r\n\r\n\"Four hundred thousand years!\" exclaimed Michel.  \"Ah!  I\r\nbreathe again.  Really I was frightened to hear you; I imagined\r\nthat we had not more than 50,000 years to live.\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane and Nicholl could not help laughing at their\r\ncompanion's uneasiness.  Then Nicholl, who wished to end the\r\ndiscussion, put the second question, which had just been\r\nconsidered again.\r\n\r\n\"Has the moon been inhabited?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe answer was unanimously in the affirmative.  But during this\r\ndiscussion, fruitful in somewhat hazardous theories, the\r\nprojectile was rapidly leaving the moon: the lineaments faded\r\naway from the travelers' eyes, mountains were confused in the\r\ndistance; and of all the wonderful, strange, and fantastical\r\nform of the earth's satellite, there soon remained nothing but\r\nthe imperishable remembrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nA STRUGGLE AGAINST THE IMPOSSIBLE\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a long time Barbicane and his companions looked silently and\r\nsadly upon that world which they had only seen from a distance,\r\nas Moses saw the land of Canaan, and which they were leaving\r\nwithout a possibility of ever returning to it.  The projectile's\r\nposition with regard to the moon had altered, and the base was\r\nnow turned to the earth.\r\n\r\nThis change, which Barbicane verified, did not fail to surprise them.\r\nIf the projectile was to gravitate round the satellite in an\r\nelliptical orbit, why was not its heaviest part turned toward it,\r\nas the moon turns hers to the earth?  That was a difficult point.\r\n\r\nIn watching the course of the projectile they could see that on\r\nleaving the moon it followed a course analogous to that traced\r\nin approaching her.  It was describing a very long ellipse,\r\nwhich would most likely extend to the point of equal attraction,\r\nwhere the influences of the earth and its satellite are neutralized.\r\n\r\nSuch was the conclusion which Barbicane very justly drew from\r\nfacts already observed, a conviction which his two friends\r\nshared with him.\r\n\r\n\"And when arrived at this dead point, what will become of us?\"\r\nasked Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"We don't know,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"But one can draw some hypotheses, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two,\" answered Barbicane; \"either the projectile's speed will\r\nbe insufficient, and it will remain forever immovable on this\r\nline of double attraction----\"\r\n\r\n\"I prefer the other hypothesis, whatever it may be,\" interrupted Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Or,\" continued Barbicane, \"its speed will be sufficient, and it\r\nwill continue its elliptical course, to gravitate forever around\r\nthe orb of night.\"\r\n\r\n\"A revolution not at all consoling,\" said Michel, \"to pass to\r\nthe state of humble servants to a moon whom we are accustomed to\r\nlook upon as our own handmaid.  So that is the fate in store for us?\"\r\n\r\nNeither Barbicane nor Nicholl answered.\r\n\r\n\"You do not answer,\" continued Michel impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing to answer,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Is there nothing to try?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Barbicane.  \"Do you pretend to fight against\r\nthe impossible?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?  Do one Frenchman and two Americans shrink from such\r\na word?\"\r\n\r\n\"But what would you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Subdue this motion which is bearing us away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Subdue it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" continued Michel, getting animated, \"or else alter it,\r\nand employ it to the accomplishment of our own ends.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is your affair.  If artillerymen are not masters of their\r\nprojectile they are not artillerymen.  If the projectile is to\r\ncommand the gunner, we had better ram the gunner into the gun.\r\nMy faith! fine savants! who do not know what is to become of us\r\nafter inducing me----\"\r\n\r\n\"Inducing you!\" cried Barbicane and Nicholl.  \"Inducing you!\r\nWhat do you mean by that?\"\r\n\r\n\"No recrimination,\" said Michel.  \"I do not complain, the trip\r\nhas pleased me, and the projectile agrees with me; but let us do\r\nall that is humanly possible to do the fall somewhere, even if\r\nonly on the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"We ask no better, my worthy Michel,\" replied Barbicane, \"but\r\nmeans fail us.\"\r\n\r\n\"We cannot alter the motion of the projectile?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor diminish its speed?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not even by lightening it, as they lighten an overloaded vessel?\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you throw out?\" said Nicholl.  \"We have no ballast\r\non board; and indeed it seems to me that if lightened it would\r\ngo much quicker.\"\r\n\r\n\"Slower.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quicker.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither slower nor quicker,\" said Barbicane, wishing to make\r\nhis two friends agree; \"for we float is space, and must no\r\nlonger consider specific weight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" cried Michel Ardan in a decided voice; \"then their\r\nremains but one thing to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Breakfast,\" answered the cool, audacious Frenchman, who always\r\nbrought up this solution at the most difficult juncture.\r\n\r\nIn any case, if this operation had no influence on the\r\nprojectile's course, it could at least be tried without\r\ninconvenience, and even with success from a stomachic point\r\nof view.  Certainly Michel had none but good ideas.\r\n\r\nThey breakfasted then at two in the morning; the hour mattered little.\r\nMichel served his usual repast, crowned by a glorious bottle drawn\r\nfrom his private cellar.  If ideas did not crowd on their brains,\r\nwe must despair of the Chambertin of 1853.  The repast finished,\r\nobservation began again.  Around the projectile, at an invariable\r\ndistance, were the objects which had been thrown out.  Evidently, in\r\nits translatory motion round the moon, it had not passed through\r\nany atmosphere, for the specific weight of these different objects\r\nwould have checked their relative speed.\r\n\r\nOn the side of the terrestrial sphere nothing was to be seen.\r\nThe earth was but a day old, having been new the night before at\r\ntwelve; and two days must elapse before its crescent, freed from\r\nthe solar rays, would serve as a clock to the Selenites, as in\r\nits rotary movement each of its points after twenty-four hours\r\nrepasses the same lunar meridian.\r\n\r\nOn the moon's side the sight was different; the orb shone in all\r\nher splendor amid innumerable constellations, whose purity could\r\nnot be troubled by her rays.  On the disc, the plains were\r\nalready returning to the dark tint which is seen from the earth.\r\nThe other part of the nimbus remained brilliant, and in the midst\r\nof this general brilliancy Tycho shone prominently like a sun.\r\n\r\nBarbicane had no means of estimating the projectile's speed, but\r\nreasoning showed that it must uniformly decrease, according to\r\nthe laws of mechanical reasoning.  Having admitted that the\r\nprojectile was describing an orbit around the moon, this orbit\r\nmust necessarily be elliptical; science proves that it must be so.\r\nNo motive body circulating round an attracting body fails in\r\nthis law.  Every orbit described in space is elliptical.  And why\r\nshould the projectile of the Gun Club escape this natural arrangement?\r\nIn elliptical orbits, the attracting body always occupies one of\r\nthe foci; so that at one moment the satellite is nearer, and at\r\nanother farther from the orb around which it gravitates.  When the\r\nearth is nearest the sun she is in her perihelion; and in her\r\naphelion at the farthest point.  Speaking of the moon, she is\r\nnearest to the earth in her perigee, and farthest from it in\r\nher apogee.  To use analogous expressions, with which the\r\nastronomers' language is enriched, if the projectile remains\r\nas a satellite of the moon, we must say that it is in its\r\n\"aposelene\" at its farthest point, and in its \"periselene\" at\r\nits nearest.  In the latter case, the projectile would attain\r\nits maximum of speed; and in the former its minimum.  It was\r\nevidently moving toward its aposelenitical point; and Barbicane\r\nhad reason to think that its speed would decrease up to this\r\npoint, and then increase by degrees as it neared the moon.\r\nThis speed would even become _nil_, if this point joined that of\r\nequal attraction.  Barbicane studied the consequences of these\r\ndifferent situations, and thinking what inference he could draw\r\nfrom them, when he was roughly disturbed by a cry from Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" he exclaimed, \"I must admit we are down-right simpletons!\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not say we are not,\" replied Barbicane; \"but why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because we have a very simple means of checking this speed\r\nwhich is bearing us from the moon, and we do not use it!\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is the means?\"\r\n\r\n\"To use the recoil contained in our rockets.\"\r\n\r\n\"Done!\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"We have not used this force yet,\" said Barbicane, \"it is true,\r\nbut we will do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\" asked Michel.\r\n\r\n\"When the time comes.  Observe, my friends, that in the position\r\noccupied by the projectile, an oblique position with regard to\r\nthe lunar disc, our rockets, in slightly altering its direction,\r\nmight turn it from the moon instead of drawing it nearer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" replied Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Let us wait, then.  By some inexplicable influence, the\r\nprojectile is turning its base toward the earth.  It is probable\r\nthat at the point of equal attraction, its conical cap will be\r\ndirected rigidly toward the moon; at that moment we may hope\r\nthat its speed will be _nil_; then will be the moment to act,\r\nand with the influence of our rockets we may perhaps\r\nprovoke a fall directly on the surface of the lunar disc.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo!\" said Michel.  \"What we did not do, what we could not do\r\non our first passage at the dead point, because the projectile\r\nwas then endowed with too great a speed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well reasoned,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Let us wait patiently,\" continued Barbicane.  \"Putting every\r\nchance on our side, and after having so much despaired, I may\r\nsay I think we shall gain our end.\"\r\n\r\nThis conclusion was a signal for Michel Ardan's hips and hurrahs.\r\nAnd none of the audacious boobies remembered the question that\r\nthey themselves had solved in the negative.  No! the moon is not\r\ninhabited; no! the moon is probably not habitable.  And yet they\r\nwere going to try everything to reach her.\r\n\r\nOne single question remained to be solved.  At what precise\r\nmoment the projectile would reach the point of equal attraction,\r\non which the travelers must play their last card. In order to\r\ncalculate this to within a few seconds, Barbicane had only to\r\nrefer to his notes, and to reckon the different heights taken on\r\nthe lunar parallels.  Thus the time necessary to travel over the\r\ndistance between the dead point and the south pole would be equal\r\nto the distance separating the north pole from the dead point.\r\nThe hours representing the time traveled over were carefully\r\nnoted, and the calculation was easy.  Barbicane found that this\r\npoint would be reached at one in the morning on the night of the\r\n7th-8th of December.  So that, if nothing interfered with its\r\ncourse, it would reach the given point in twenty-two hours.\r\n\r\nThe rockets had primarily been placed to check the fall of the\r\nprojectile upon the moon, and now they were going to employ them\r\nfor a directly contrary purpose.  In any case they were ready,\r\nand they had only to wait for the moment to set fire to them.\r\n\r\n\"Since there is nothing else to be done,\" said Nicholl, \"I make\r\na proposition.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"I propose to go to sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a motion!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"It is forty hours since we closed our eyes,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\"Some hours of sleep will restore our strength.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" interrupted Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" continued Nicholl, \"every one to his taste; I shall go\r\nto sleep.\"  And stretching himself on the divan, he soon snored\r\nlike a forty-eight pounder.\r\n\r\n\"That Nicholl has a good deal of sense,\" said Barbicane;\r\n\"presently I shall follow his example.\"  Some moments after his\r\ncontinued bass supported the captain's baritone.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Michel Ardan, finding himself alone, \"these\r\npractical people have sometimes most opportune ideas.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with his long legs stretched out, and his great arms folded\r\nunder his head, Michel slept in his turn.\r\n\r\nBut this sleep could be neither peaceful nor lasting, the minds\r\nof these three men were too much occupied, and some hours after,\r\nabout seven in the morning, all three were on foot at the same instant.\r\n\r\nThe projectile was still leaving the moon, and turning its\r\nconical part more and more toward her.\r\n\r\nAn explicable phenomenon, but one which happily served\r\nBarbicane's ends.\r\n\r\nSeventeen hours more, and the moment for action would have arrived.\r\n\r\nThe day seemed long.  However bold the travelers might be, they\r\nwere greatly impressed by the approach of that moment which\r\nwould decide all-- either precipitate their fall on to the moon,\r\nor forever chain them in an immutable orbit.  They counted the\r\nhours as they passed too slow for their wish; Barbicane and\r\nNicholl were obstinately plunged in their calculations, Michel\r\ngoing and coming between the narrow walls, and watching that\r\nimpassive moon with a longing eye.\r\n\r\nAt times recollections of the earth crossed their minds.  They saw\r\nonce more their friends of the Gun Club, and the dearest of all,\r\nJ. T. Maston.  At that moment, the honorable secretary must be\r\nfilling his post on the Rocky Mountains.  If he could see the\r\nprojectile through the glass of his gigantic telescope, what\r\nwould he think?  After seeing it disappear behind the moon's\r\nsouth pole, he would see them reappear by the north pole!\r\nThey must therefore be a satellite of a satellite!  Had J. T.\r\nMaston given this unexpected news to the world?  Was this the\r\n_denouement_ of this great enterprise?\r\n\r\nBut the day passed without incident.  The terrestrial\r\nmidnight arrived.  The 8th of December was beginning.\r\nOne hour more, and the point of equal attraction would\r\nbe reached.  What speed would then animate the projectile?\r\nThey could not estimate it.  But no error could vitiate\r\nBarbicane's calculations.  At one in the morning this speed\r\nought to be and would be _nil_.\r\n\r\nBesides, another phenomenon would mark the projectile's\r\nstopping-point on the neutral line.  At that spot the two\r\nattractions, lunar and terrestrial, would be annulled.\r\nObjects would \"weigh\" no more.  This singular fact, which had\r\nsurprised Barbicane and his companions so much in going, would\r\nbe repeated on their return under the very same conditions.\r\nAt this precise moment they must act.\r\n\r\nAlready the projectile's conical top was sensibly turned toward\r\nthe lunar disc, presented in such a way as to utilize the whole\r\nof the recoil produced by the pressure of the rocket apparatus.\r\nThe chances were in favor of the travelers.  If its speed was\r\nutterly annulled on this dead point, a decided movement toward\r\nthe moon would suffice, however slight, to determine its fall.\r\n\r\n\"Five minutes to one,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"All is ready,\" replied Michel Ardan, directing a lighted match\r\nto the flame of the gas.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" said Barbicane, holding his chronometer in his hand.\r\n\r\nAt that moment weight had no effect.  The travelers felt in\r\nthemselves the entire disappearance of it.  They were very near\r\nthe neutral point, if they did not touch it.\r\n\r\n\"One o'clock,\" said Barbicane.\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan applied the lighted match to a train in\r\ncommunication with the rockets.  No detonation was heard in\r\nthe inside, for there was no air.  But, through the scuttles,\r\nBarbicane saw a prolonged smoke, the flames of which were\r\nimmediately extinguished.\r\n\r\nThe projectile sustained a certain shock, which was sensibly\r\nfelt in the interior.\r\n\r\nThe three friends looked and listened without speaking, and\r\nscarcely breathing.  One might have heard the beating of their\r\nhearts amid this perfect silence.\r\n\r\n\"Are we falling?\" asked Michel Ardan, at length.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Nicholl, \"since the bottom of the projectile is not\r\nturning to the lunar disc!\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Barbicane, quitting his scuttle, turned to his\r\ntwo companions.  He was frightfully pale, his forehead wrinkled,\r\nand his lips contracted.\r\n\r\n\"We are falling!\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" cried Michel Ardan, \"on to the moon?\"\r\n\r\n\"On to the earth!\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, adding philosophically,\r\n\"well, when we came into this projectile we were very doubtful\r\nas to the ease with which we should get out of it!\"\r\n\r\nAnd now this fearful fall had begun.  The speed retained had\r\nborne the projectile beyond the dead point.  The explosion of\r\nthe rockets could not divert its course.  This speed in going\r\nhad carried it over the neutral line, and in returning had done\r\nthe same thing.  The laws of physics condemned it _to pass\r\nthrough every point which it had already gone through_.  It was\r\na terrible fall, from a height of 160,000 miles, and no springs\r\nto break it.  According to the laws of gunnery, the projectile\r\nmust strike the earth with a speed equal to that with which it\r\nleft the mouth of the Columbiad, a speed of 16,000 yards in the\r\nlast second.\r\n\r\nBut to give some figures of comparison, it has been reckoned\r\nthat an object thrown from the top of the towers of Notre Dame,\r\nthe height of which is only 200 feet, will arrive on the\r\npavement at a speed of 240 miles per hour.  Here the projectile\r\nmust strike the earth with a speed of 115,200 miles per hour.\r\n\r\n\"We are lost!\" said Michel coolly.\r\n\r\n\"Very well! if we die,\" answered Barbicane, with a sort of\r\nreligious enthusiasm, \"the results of our travels will be\r\nmagnificently spread. It is His own secret that God will\r\ntell us!  In the other life the soul will want to know nothing,\r\neither of machines or engines!  It will be identified with\r\neternal wisdom!\"\r\n\r\n\"In fact,\" interrupted Michel Ardan, \"the whole of the other\r\nworld may well console us for the loss of that inferior orb\r\ncalled the moon!\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane crossed his arms on his breast, with a motion of\r\nsublime resignation, saying at the same time:\r\n\r\n\"The will of heaven be done!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUNDINGS OF THE SUSQUEHANNA\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, lieutenant, and our soundings?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think, sir, that the operation is nearing its completion,\"\r\nreplied Lieutenant Bronsfield.  \"But who would have thought of\r\nfinding such a depth so near in shore, and only 200 miles from\r\nthe American coast?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, Bronsfield, there is a great depression,\" said\r\nCaptain Blomsberry.  \"In this spot there is a submarine valley\r\nworn by Humboldt's current, which skirts the coast of America as\r\nfar as the Straits of Magellan.\"\r\n\r\n\"These great depths,\" continued the lieutenant, \"are not\r\nfavorable for laying telegraphic cables.  A level bottom, like\r\nthat supporting the American cable between Valentia and\r\nNewfoundland, is much better.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you, Bronsfield.  With your permission,\r\nlieutenant, where are we now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, at this moment we have 3,508 fathoms of line out, and the\r\nball which draws the sounding lead has not yet touched the\r\nbottom; for if so, it would have come up of itself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brook's apparatus is very ingenious,\" said Captain Blomsberry;\r\n\"it gives us very exact soundings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Touch!\" cried at this moment one of the men at the forewheel,\r\nwho was superintending the operation.\r\n\r\nThe captain and the lieutenant mounted the quarterdeck.\r\n\r\n\"What depth have we?\" asked the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Three thousand six hundred and twenty-seven fathoms,\" replied\r\nthe lieutenant, entering it in his notebook.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Bronsfield,\" said the captain, \"I will take down\r\nthe result.  Now haul in the sounding line.  It will be the\r\nwork of some hours.  In that time the engineer can light the\r\nfurnaces, and we shall be ready to start as soon as you\r\nhave finished.  It is ten o'clock, and with your permission,\r\nlieutenant, I will turn in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do so, sir; do so!\" replied the lieutenant obligingly.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the Susquehanna, as brave a man as need be, and\r\nthe humble servant of his officers, returned to his cabin, took\r\na brandy-grog, which earned for the steward no end of praise,\r\nand turned in, not without having complimented his servant upon\r\nhis making beds, and slept a peaceful sleep.\r\n\r\nIt was then ten at night.  The eleventh day of the month of\r\nDecember was drawing to a close in a magnificent night.\r\n\r\nThe Susquehanna, a corvette of 500 horse-power, of the United\r\nStates navy, was occupied in taking soundings in the Pacific\r\nOcean about 200 miles off the American coast, following that\r\nlong peninsula which stretches down the coast of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe wind had dropped by degrees.  There was no disturbance in\r\nthe air.  The pennant hung motionless from the maintop-gallant-\r\nmast truck.\r\n\r\nCaptain Jonathan Blomsberry (cousin-german of Colonel\r\nBlomsberry, one of the most ardent supporters of the Gun Club,\r\nwho had married an aunt of the captain and daughter of an\r\nhonorable Kentucky merchant)-- Captain Blomsberry could not have\r\nwished for finer weather in which to bring to a close his\r\ndelicate operations of sounding.  His corvette had not even felt\r\nthe great tempest, which by sweeping away the groups of clouds\r\non the Rocky Mountains, had allowed them to observe the course\r\nof the famous projectile.\r\n\r\nEverything went well, and with all the fervor of a Presbyterian,\r\nhe did not forget to thank heaven for it.  The series of\r\nsoundings taken by the Susquehanna, had for its aim the finding\r\nof a favorable spot for the laying of a submarine cable to\r\nconnect the Hawaiian Islands with the coast of America.\r\n\r\nIt was a great undertaking, due to the instigation of a\r\npowerful company.  Its managing director, the intelligent Cyrus\r\nField, purposed even covering all the islands of Oceanica with\r\na vast electrical network, an immense enterprise, and one worthy\r\nof American genius.\r\n\r\nTo the corvette Susquehanna had been confided the first\r\noperations of sounding.  It was on the night of the 11th-12th of\r\nDecember, she was in exactly 27@ 7' north latitude, and 41@ 37'\r\nwest longitude, on the meridian of Washington.\r\n\r\nThe moon, then in her last quarter, was beginning to rise above\r\nthe horizon.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of Captain Blomsberry, the lieutenant and\r\nsome officers were standing together on the poop.  On the\r\nappearance of the moon, their thoughts turned to that orb which\r\nthe eyes of a whole hemisphere were contemplating.  The best\r\nnaval glasses could not have discovered the projectile wandering\r\naround its hemisphere, and yet all were pointed toward that\r\nbrilliant disc which millions of eyes were looking at at the\r\nsame moment.\r\n\r\n\"They have been gone ten days,\" said Lieutenant Bronsfield\r\nat last.  \"What has become of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"They have arrived, lieutenant,\" exclaimed a young midshipman,\r\n\"and they are doing what all travelers do when they arrive in a\r\nnew country, taking a walk!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!  I am sure of that, if you tell me so, my young friend,\"\r\nsaid Lieutenant Bronsfield, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" continued another officer, \"their arrival cannot\r\nbe doubted.  The projectile was to reach the moon when full\r\non the 5th at midnight.  We are now at the 11th of December, which\r\nmakes six days.  And in six times twenty-four hours, without\r\ndarkness, one would have time to settle comfortably.  I fancy I\r\nsee my brave countrymen encamped at the bottom of some valley,\r\non the borders of a Selenite stream, near a projectile half-buried\r\nby its fall amid volcanic rubbish, Captain Nicholl beginning his\r\nleveling operations, President Barbicane writing out his notes,\r\nand Michel Ardan embalming the lunar solitudes with the perfume\r\nof his----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! it must be so, it is so!\" exclaimed the young midshipman,\r\nworked up to a pitch of enthusiasm by this ideal description of\r\nhis superior officer.\r\n\r\n\"I should like to believe it,\" replied the lieutenant, who was\r\nquite unmoved.  \"Unfortunately direct news from the lunar world\r\nis still wanting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Beg pardon, lieutenant,\" said the midshipman, \"but cannot\r\nPresident Barbicane write?\"\r\n\r\nA burst of laughter greeted this answer.\r\n\r\n\"No letters!\" continued the young man quickly.  \"The postal\r\nadministration has something to see to there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Might it not be the telegraphic service that is at fault?\"\r\nasked one of the officers ironically.\r\n\r\n\"Not necessarily,\" replied the midshipman, not at all confused.\r\n\"But it is very easy to set up a graphic communication with\r\nthe earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how?\"\r\n\r\n\"By means of the telescope at Long's Peak.  You know it brings\r\nthe moon to within four miles of the Rocky Mountains, and that\r\nit shows objects on its surface of only nine feet in diameter.\r\nVery well; let our industrious friends construct a giant\r\nalphabet; let them write words three fathoms long, and sentences\r\nthree miles long, and then they can send us news of themselves.\"\r\n\r\nThe young midshipman, who had a certain amount of imagination,\r\nwas loudly applauded; Lieutenant Bronsfield allowing that the\r\nidea was possible, but observing that if by these means they\r\ncould receive news from the lunar world they could not send any\r\nfrom the terrestrial, unless the Selenites had instruments fit\r\nfor taking distant observations at their disposal.\r\n\r\n\"Evidently,\" said one of the officers; \"but what has become of\r\nthe travelers? what they have done, what they have seen, that\r\nabove all must interest us.  Besides, if the experiment has\r\nsucceeded (which I do not doubt), they will try it again.\r\nThe Columbiad is still sunk in the soil of Florida.  It is now\r\nonly a question of powder and shot; and every time the moon is\r\nat her zenith a cargo of visitors may be sent to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is clear,\" replied Lieutenant Bronsfield, \"that J. T. Maston\r\nwill one day join his friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he will have me,\" cried the midshipman, \"I am ready!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! volunteers will not be wanting,\" answered Bronsfield; \"and\r\nif it were allowed, half of the earth's inhabitants would\r\nemigrate to the moon!\"\r\n\r\nThis conversation between the officers of the Susquehanna was\r\nkept up until nearly one in the morning.  We cannot say what\r\nblundering systems were broached, what inconsistent theories\r\nadvanced by these bold spirits.  Since Barbicane's attempt,\r\nnothing seemed impossible to the Americans.  They had already\r\ndesigned an expedition, not only of savants, but of a whole\r\ncolony toward the Selenite borders, and a complete army,\r\nconsisting of infantry, artillery, and cavalry, to conquer the\r\nlunar world.\r\n\r\nAt one in the morning, the hauling in of the sounding-line was\r\nnot yet completed; 1,670 fathoms were still out, which would\r\nentail some hours' work.  According to the commander's orders,\r\nthe fires had been lighted, and steam was being got up.\r\nThe Susquehanna could have started that very instant.\r\n\r\nAt that moment (it was seventeen minutes past one in the\r\nmorning) Lieutenant Bronsfield was preparing to leave the watch\r\nand return to his cabin, when his attention was attracted by a\r\ndistant hissing noise.  His comrades and himself first thought\r\nthat this hissing was caused by the letting off of steam; but\r\nlifting their heads, they found that the noise was produced in\r\nthe highest regions of the air.  They had not time to question\r\neach other before the hissing became frightfully intense, and\r\nsuddenly there appeared to their dazzled eyes an enormous\r\nmeteor, ignited by the rapidity of its course and its friction\r\nthrough the atmospheric strata.\r\n\r\nThis fiery mass grew larger to their eyes, and fell, with\r\nthe noise of thunder, upon the bowsprit, which it smashed close\r\nto the stem, and buried itself in the waves with a deafening roar!\r\n\r\nA few feet nearer, and the Susquehanna would have foundered with\r\nall on board!\r\n\r\nAt this instant Captain Blomsberry appeared, half-dressed, and\r\nrushing on to the forecastle-deck, whither all the officers had\r\nhurried, exclaimed, \"With your permission, gentlemen, what\r\nhas happened?\"\r\n\r\nAnd the midshipman, making himself as it were the echo of the\r\nbody, cried, \"Commander, it is `they' come back again!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. T. MASTON RECALLED\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is `they' come back again!\" the young midshipman had said,\r\nand every one had understood him.  No one doubted but that the\r\nmeteor was the projectile of the Gun Club.  As to the travelers\r\nwhich it enclosed, opinions were divided regarding their fate.\r\n\r\n\"They are dead!\" said one.\r\n\r\n\"They are alive!\" said another; \"the crater is deep, and the\r\nshock was deadened.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they must have wanted air,\" continued a third speaker;\r\n\"they must have died of suffocation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Burned!\" replied a fourth; \"the projectile was nothing but an\r\nincandescent mass as it crossed the atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does it matter!\" they exclaimed unanimously; \"living or\r\ndead, we must pull them out!\"\r\n\r\nBut Captain Blomsberry had assembled his officers, and \"with\r\ntheir permission,\" was holding a council.  They must decide upon\r\nsomething to be done immediately.  The more hasty ones were for\r\nfishing up the projectile.  A difficult operation, though not an\r\nimpossible one.  But the corvette had no proper machinery, which\r\nmust be both fixed and powerful; so it was resolved that they\r\nshould put in at the nearest port, and give information to the\r\nGun Club of the projectile's fall.\r\n\r\nThis determination was unanimous.  The choice of the port had\r\nto be discussed.  The neighboring coast had no anchorage on\r\n27@ latitude.  Higher up, above the peninsula of Monterey, stands\r\nthe important town from which it takes its name; but, seated on\r\nthe borders of a perfect desert, it was not connected with the\r\ninterior by a network of telegraphic wires, and electricity\r\nalone could spread these important news fast enough.\r\n\r\nSome degrees above opened the bay of San Francisco.  Through the\r\ncapital of the gold country communication would be easy with the\r\nheart of the Union.  And in less than two days the Susquehanna,\r\nby putting on high pressure, could arrive in that port.  She must\r\ntherefore start at once.\r\n\r\nThe fires were made up; they could set off immediately.\r\nTwo thousand fathoms of line were still out, which Captain\r\nBlomsberry, not wishing to lose precious time in hauling in,\r\nresolved to cut.\r\n\r\n\"we will fasten the end to a buoy,\" said he, \"and that buoy will\r\nshow us the exact spot where the projectile fell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" replied Lieutenant Bronsfield, \"we have our situation\r\nexact-- 27@ 7' north latitude and 41@ 37' west longitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Bronsfield,\" replied the captain, \"now, with your\r\npermission, we will have the line cut.\"\r\n\r\nA strong buoy, strengthened by a couple of spars, was thrown\r\ninto the ocean.  The end of the rope was carefully lashed to it;\r\nand, left solely to the rise and fall of the billows, the buoy\r\nwould not sensibly deviate from the spot.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the engineer sent to inform the captain that\r\nsteam was up and they could start, for which agreeable\r\ncommunication the captain thanked him.  The course was then\r\ngiven north-northeast, and the corvette, wearing, steered at\r\nfull steam direct for San Francisco.  It was three in the morning.\r\n\r\nFour hundred and fifty miles to cross; it was nothing for a good\r\nvessel like the Susquehanna.  In thirty-six hours she had covered\r\nthat distance; and on the 14th of December, at twenty-seven\r\nminutes past one at night, she entered the bay of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of a ship of the national navy arriving at full speed,\r\nwith her bowsprit broken, public curiosity was greatly roused.\r\nA dense crowd soon assembled on the quay, waiting for them\r\nto disembark.\r\n\r\nAfter casting anchor, Captain Blomsberry and Lieutenant\r\nBronsfield entered an eight-pared cutter, which soon brought\r\nthem to land.\r\n\r\nThey jumped on to the quay.\r\n\r\n\"The telegraph?\" they asked, without answering one of the\r\nthousand questions addressed to them.\r\n\r\nThe officer of the port conducted them to the telegraph office\r\nthrough a concourse of spectators.  Blomsberry and Bronsfield\r\nentered, while the crowd crushed each other at the door.\r\n\r\nSome minutes later a fourfold telegram was sent out--the first\r\nto the Naval Secretary at Washington; the second to the\r\nvice-president of the Gun Club, Baltimore; the third to the Hon.\r\nJ. T. Maston, Long's Peak, Rocky Mountains; and the fourth to\r\nthe sub-director of the Cambridge Observatory, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nIt was worded as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 20@ 7' north latitude, and 41@ 37' west longitude, on the\r\n12th of December, at seventeen minutes past one in the morning,\r\nthe projectile of the Columbiad fell into the Pacific.\r\nSend instructions.-- BLOMSBERRY, Commander Susquehanna.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive minutes afterward the whole town of San Francisco learned\r\nthe news.  Before six in the evening the different States of the\r\nUnion had heard the great catastrophe; and after midnight, by\r\nthe cable, the whole of Europe knew the result of the great\r\nAmerican experiment.  We will not attempt to picture the effect\r\nproduced on the entire world by that unexpected denouement.\r\n\r\nOn receipt of the telegram the Naval Secretary telegraphed to\r\nthe Susquehanna to wait in the bay of San Francisco without\r\nextinguishing her fires.  Day and night she must be ready\r\nto put to sea.\r\n\r\nThe Cambridge observatory called a special meeting; and, with\r\nthat composure which distinguishes learned bodies in general,\r\npeacefully discussed the scientific bearings of the question.\r\nAt the Gun Club there was an explosion.  All the gunners\r\nwere assembled.  Vice-President the Hon. Wilcome was in the\r\nact of reading the premature dispatch, in which J. T. Maston\r\nand Belfast announced that the projectile had just been seen in\r\nthe gigantic reflector of Long's Peak, and also that it was held\r\nby lunar attraction, and was playing the part of under satellite\r\nto the lunar world.\r\n\r\nWe know the truth on that point.\r\n\r\nBut on the arrival of Blomsberry's dispatch, so decidely\r\ncontradicting J. T. Maston's telegram, two parties were formed\r\nin the bosom of the Gun Club.  On one side were those who\r\nadmitted the fall of the projectile, and consequently the return\r\nof the travelers; on the other, those who believed in the\r\nobservations of Long's Peak, concluded that the commander of the\r\nSusquehanna had made a mistake.  To the latter the pretended\r\nprojectile was nothing but a meteor! nothing but a meteor, a\r\nshooting globe, which in its fall had smashed the bows of\r\nthe corvette.  It was difficult to answer this argument, for\r\nthe speed with which it was animated must have made observation\r\nvery difficult.  The commander of the Susquehanna and her\r\nofficers might have made a mistake in all good faith; one argument\r\nhowever, was in their favor, namely, that if the projectile had\r\nfallen on the earth, its place of meeting with the terrestrial\r\nglobe could only take place on this 27@ north latitude, and\r\n(taking into consideration the time that had elapsed, and the\r\nrotary motion of the earth) between the 41@ and the 42@ of\r\nwest longitude.  In any case, it was decided in the Gun Club\r\nthat Blomsberry brothers, Bilsby, and Major Elphinstone should\r\ngo straight to San Francisco, and consult as to the means of\r\nraising the projectile from the depths of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThese devoted men set off at once; and the railroad, which will\r\nsoon cross the whole of Central America, took them as far as St.\r\nLouis, where the swift mail-coaches awaited them.  Almost at the\r\nsame moment in which the Secretary of Marine, the vice-president\r\nof the Gun Club, and the sub-director of the Observatory received\r\nthe dispatch from San Francisco, the Honorable J. T. Maston was\r\nundergoing the greatest excitement he had ever experienced in his\r\nlife, an excitement which even the bursting of his pet gun, which\r\nhad more than once nearly cost him his life, had not caused him.\r\nWe may remember that the secretary of the Gun Club had started\r\nsoon after the projectile (and almost as quickly) for the station\r\non Long's Peak, in the Rocky Mountains, J. Belfast, director of the\r\nCambridge Observatory, accompanying him.  Arrived there, the two\r\nfriends had installed themselves at once, never quitting the\r\nsummit of their enormous telescope.  We know that this gigantic\r\ninstrument had been set up according to the reflecting system,\r\ncalled by the English \"front view.\"  This arrangement subjected\r\nall objects to but one reflection, making the view consequently\r\nmuch clearer; the result was that, when they were taking\r\nobservation, J. T. Maston and Belfast were placed in the _upper_\r\npart of the instrument and not in the lower, which they reached\r\nby a circular staircase, a masterpiece of lightness, while below\r\nthem opened a metal well terminated by the metallic mirror,\r\nwhich measured two hundred and eighty feet in depth.\r\n\r\nIt was on a narrow platform placed above the telescope that the\r\ntwo savants passed their existence, execrating the day which hid\r\nthe moon from their eyes, and the clouds which obstinately\r\nveiled her during the night.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was their delight when, after some days of waiting,\r\non the night of the 5th of December, they saw the vehicle which\r\nwas bearing their friends into space!  To this delight succeeded\r\na great deception, when, trusting to a cursory observation, they\r\nlaunched their first telegram to the world, erroneously\r\naffirming that the projectile had become a satellite of the\r\nmoon, gravitating in an immutable orbit.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment it had never shown itself to their eyes-- a\r\ndisappearance all the more easily explained, as it was then\r\npassing behind the moon's invisible disc; but when it was time\r\nfor it to reappear on the visible disc, one may imagine the\r\nimpatience of the fuming J. T. Maston and his not less\r\nimpatient companion.  Each minute of the night they thought\r\nthey saw the projectile once more, and they did not see it.\r\nHence constant discussions and violent disputes between them,\r\nBelfast affirming that the projectile could not be seen, J. T.\r\nMaston maintaining that \"it had put his eyes out.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the projectile!\" repeated J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Belfast; \"it is an avalanche detached from a\r\nlunar mountain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we shall see it to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we shall not see it any more.  It is carried into space.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\"\r\n\r\nAnd at these moments, when contradictions rained like hail, the\r\nwell-known irritability of the secretary of the Gun Club\r\nconstituted a permanent danger for the Honorable Belfast.\r\nThe existence of these two together would soon have become\r\nimpossible; but an unforseen event cut short their\r\neverlasting discussions.\r\n\r\nDuring the night, from the 14th to the 15th of December, the two\r\nirreconcilable friends were busy observing the lunar disc, J. T.\r\nMaston abusing the learned Belfast as usual, who was by his\r\nside; the secretary of the Gun Club maintaining for the\r\nthousandth time that he had just seen the projectile, and adding\r\nthat he could see Michel Ardan's face looking through one of the\r\nscuttles, at the same time enforcing his argument by a series of\r\ngestures which his formidable hook rendered very unpleasant.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Belfast's servant appeared on the platform (it\r\nwas ten at night) and gave him a dispatch.  It was the commander\r\nof the Susquehanna's telegram.\r\n\r\nBelfast tore the envelope and read, and uttered a cry.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\n\"The projectile!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well!\"\r\n\r\n\"Has fallen to the earth!\"\r\n\r\nAnother cry, this time a perfect howl, answered him.  He turned\r\ntoward J. T. Maston.  The unfortunate man, imprudently leaning\r\nover the metal tube, had disappeared in the immense telescope.\r\nA fall of two hundred and eighty feet!  Belfast, dismayed,\r\nrushed to the orifice of the reflector.\r\n\r\nHe breathed.  J. T. Maston, caught by his metal hook, was\r\nholding on by one of the rings which bound the telescope\r\ntogether, uttering fearful cries.\r\n\r\nBelfast called.  Help was brought, tackle was let down, and they\r\nhoisted up, not without some trouble, the imprudent secretary of\r\nthe Gun Club.\r\n\r\nHe reappeared at the upper orifice without hurt.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said he, \"if I had broken the mirror?\"\r\n\r\n\"You would have paid for it,\" replied Belfast severely.\r\n\r\n\"And that cursed projectile has fallen?\" asked J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\n\"Into the Pacific!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us go!\"\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour after the two savants were descending the\r\ndeclivity of the Rocky Mountains; and two days after, at the\r\nsame time as their friends of the Gun Club, they arrived at San\r\nFrancisco, having killed five horses on the road.\r\n\r\nElphinstone, the brothers Blomsberry, and Bilsby rushed toward\r\nthem on their arrival.\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do?\" they exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Fish up the projectile,\" replied J. T. Maston, \"and the sooner\r\nthe better.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOVERED FROM THE SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spot where the projectile sank under the waves was exactly\r\nknown; but the machinery to grasp it and bring it to the surface\r\nof the ocean was still wanting.  It must first be invented,\r\nthen made.  American engineers could not be troubled with\r\nsuch trifles.  The grappling-irons once fixed, by their help\r\nthey were sure to raise it in spite of its weight, which was\r\nlessened by the density of the liquid in which it was plunged.\r\n\r\nBut fishing-up the projectile was not the only thing to be thought of.\r\nThey must act promptly in the interest of the travelers.  No one\r\ndoubted that they were still living.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" repeated J. T. Maston incessantly, whose confidence\r\ngained over everybody, \"our friends are clever people, and they\r\ncannot have fallen like simpletons.  They are alive, quite alive;\r\nbut we must make haste if we wish to find them so.  Food and\r\nwater do not trouble me; they have enough for a long while.\r\nBut air, air, that is what they will soon want; so quick, quick!\"\r\n\r\nAnd they did go quick.  They fitted up the Susquehanna for her\r\nnew destination.  Her powerful machinery was brought to bear\r\nupon the hauling-chains.  The aluminum projectile only weighed\r\n19,250 pounds, a weight very inferior to that of the transatlantic\r\ncable which had been drawn up under similar conditions.  The only\r\ndifficulty was in fishing up a cylindro-conical projectile, the\r\nwalls of which were so smooth as to offer no hold for the hooks.\r\nOn that account Engineer Murchison hastened to San Francisco,\r\nand had some enormous grappling-irons fixed on an automatic\r\nsystem, which would never let the projectile go if it once\r\nsucceeded in seizing it in its powerful claws.  Diving-dresses\r\nwere also prepared, which through this impervious covering allowed\r\nthe divers to observe the bottom of the sea.  He also had put on\r\nboard an apparatus of compressed air very cleverly designed.\r\nThere were perfect chambers pierced with scuttles, which, with\r\nwater let into certain compartments, could draw it down into\r\ngreat depths.  These apparatuses were at San Francisco, where\r\nthey had been used in the construction of a submarine breakwater;\r\nand very fortunately it was so, for there was no time to\r\nconstruct any.  But in spite of the perfection of the machinery,\r\nin spite of the ingenuity of the savants entrusted with the use\r\nof them, the success of the operation was far from being certain.\r\nHow great were the chances against them, the projectile being\r\n20,000 feet under the water!  And if even it was brought to the\r\nsurface, how would the travelers have borne the terrible shock\r\nwhich 20,000 feet of water had perhaps not sufficiently broken?\r\nAt any rate they must act quickly.  J. T. Maston hurried the\r\nworkmen day and night.  He was ready to don the diving-dress\r\nhimself, or try the air apparatus, in order to reconnoiter the\r\nsituation of his courageous friends.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of all the diligence displayed in preparing the\r\ndifferent engines, in spite of the considerable sum placed at\r\nthe disposal of the Gun Club by the Government of the Union,\r\nfive long days (five centuries!) elapsed before the preparations\r\nwere complete.  During this time public opinion was excited to\r\nthe highest pitch.  Telegrams were exchanged incessantly\r\nthroughout the entire world by means of wires and electric cables.\r\nThe saving of Barbicane, Nicholl, and Michel Ardan was an\r\ninternational affair.  Every one who had subscribed to the Gun\r\nClub was directly interested in the welfare of the travelers.\r\n\r\nAt length the hauling-chains, the air-chambers, and the\r\nautomatic grappling-irons were put on board.  J. T. Maston,\r\nEngineer Murchison, and the delegates of the Gun Club, were\r\nalready in their cabins.  They had but to start, which they did\r\non the 21st of December, at eight o'clock at night, the corvette\r\nmeeting with a beautiful sea, a northeasterly wind, and rather\r\nsharp cold.  The whole population of San Francisco was gathered\r\non the quay, greatly excited but silent, reserving their hurrahs\r\nfor the return.  Steam was fully up, and the screw of the\r\nSusquehanna carried them briskly out of the bay.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to relate the conversations on board between\r\nthe officers, sailors, and passengers.  All these men had but\r\none thought.  All these hearts beat under the same emotion.\r\nWhile they were hastening to help them, what were Barbicane and\r\nhis companions doing?  What had become of them?  Were they able to\r\nattempt any bold maneuver to regain their liberty?  None could say.\r\nThe truth is that every attempt must have failed!  Immersed nearly\r\nfour miles under the ocean, this metal prison defied every effort\r\nof its prisoners.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd inst., at eight in the morning, after a rapid\r\npassage, the Susquehanna was due at the fatal spot.  They must\r\nwait till twelve to take the reckoning exactly.  The buoy\r\nto which the sounding line had been lashed had not yet\r\nbeen recognized.\r\n\r\nAt twelve, Captain Blomsberry, assisted by his officers who\r\nsuperintended the observations, took the reckoning in the\r\npresence of the delegates of the Gun Club.  Then there was a\r\nmoment of anxiety.  Her position decided, the Susquehanna was\r\nfound to be some minutes westward of the spot where the\r\nprojectile had disappeared beneath the waves.\r\n\r\nThe ship's course was then changed so as to reach this exact point.\r\n\r\nAt forty-seven minutes past twelve they reached the buoy; it was\r\nin perfect condition, and must have shifted but little.\r\n\r\n\"At last!\" exclaimed J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we begin?\" asked Captain Blomsberry.\r\n\r\n\"Without losing a second.\"\r\n\r\nEvery precaution was taken to keep the corvette almost\r\ncompletely motionless.  Before trying to seize the projectile,\r\nEngineer Murchison wanted to find its exact position at the\r\nbottom of the ocean.  The submarine apparatus destined for this\r\nexpedition was supplied with air.  The working of these engines\r\nwas not without danger, for at 20,000 feet below the surface of\r\nthe water, and under such great pressure, they were exposed to\r\nfracture, the consequences of which would be dreadful.\r\n\r\nJ. T. Maston, the brothers Blomsberry, and Engineer Murchison,\r\nwithout heeding these dangers, took their places in the\r\nair-chamber.  The commander, posted on his bridge, superintended\r\nthe operation, ready to stop or haul in the chains on the\r\nslightest signal.  The screw had been shipped, and the whole\r\npower of the machinery collected on the capstan would have\r\nquickly drawn the apparatus on board.  The descent began at\r\ntwenty-five minutes past one at night, and the chamber,\r\ndrawn under by the reservoirs full of water, disappeared\r\nfrom the surface of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe emotion of the officers and sailors on board was now\r\ndivided between the prisoners in the projectile and the\r\nprisoners in the submarine apparatus.  As to the latter, they\r\nforgot themselves, and, glued to the windows of the scuttles,\r\nattentively watched the liquid mass through which they were passing.\r\n\r\nThe descent was rapid.  At seventeen minutes past two, J. T.\r\nMaston and his companions had reached the bottom of the Pacific;\r\nbut they saw nothing but an arid desert, no longer animated by\r\neither fauna or flora.  By the light of their lamps, furnished\r\nwith powerful reflectors, they could see the dark beds of the\r\nocean for a considerable extent of view, but the projectile was\r\nnowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe impatience of these bold divers cannot be described, and\r\nhaving an electrical communication with the corvette, they made\r\na signal already agreed upon, and for the space of a mile the\r\nSusquehanna moved their chamber along some yards above the bottom.\r\n\r\nThus they explored the whole submarine plain, deceived at every\r\nturn by optical illusions which almost broke their hearts.\r\nHere a rock, there a projection from the ground, seemed to be\r\nthe much-sought-for projectile; but their mistake was soon\r\ndiscovered, and then they were in despair.\r\n\r\n\"But where are they? where are they?\" cried J. T. Maston.  And the\r\npoor man called loudly upon Nicholl, Barbicane, and Michel Ardan,\r\nas if his unfortunate friends could either hear or answer him\r\nthrough such an impenetrable medium!  The search continued under\r\nthese conditions until the vitiated air compelled the divers to ascend.\r\n\r\nThe hauling in began about six in the evening, and was not ended\r\nbefore midnight.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow,\" said J. T. Maston, as he set foot on the bridge of\r\nthe corvette.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Captain Blomsberry.\r\n\r\n\"And on another spot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nJ. T. Maston did not doubt of their final success, but his\r\ncompanions, no longer upheld by the excitement of the first\r\nhours, understood all the difficulty of the enterprise.\r\nWhat seemed easy at San Francisco, seemed here in the wide\r\nocean almost impossible.  The chances of success diminished in\r\nrapid proportion; and it was from chance alone that the meeting\r\nwith the projectile might be expected.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 24th, in spite of the fatigue of the previous\r\nday, the operation was renewed.  The corvette advanced some\r\nminutes to westward, and the apparatus, provided with air, bore\r\nthe same explorers to the depths of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe whole day passed in fruitless research; the bed of the sea\r\nwas a desert.  The 25th brought no other result, nor the 26th.\r\n\r\nIt was disheartening.  They thought of those unfortunates shut\r\nup in the projectile for twenty-six days.  Perhaps at that\r\nmoment they were experiencing the first approach of suffocation;\r\nthat is, if they had escaped the dangers of their fall.  The air\r\nwas spent, and doubtless with the air all their _morale_.\r\n\r\n\"The air, possibly,\" answered J. T. Maston resolutely, \"but\r\ntheir _morale_ never!\"\r\n\r\nOn the 28th, after two more days of search, all hope was gone.\r\nThis projectile was but an atom in the immensity of the ocean.\r\nThey must give up all idea of finding it.\r\n\r\nBut J. T. Maston would not hear of going away.  He would not\r\nabandon the place without at least discovering the tomb of\r\nhis friends.  But Commander Blomsberry could no longer persist,\r\nand in spite of the exclamations of the worthy secretary, was\r\nobliged to give the order to sail.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of December, at nine A.M., the Susquehanna, heading\r\nnortheast, resumed her course to the bay of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nIt was ten in the morning; the corvette was under half-steam, as\r\nit was regretting to leave the spot where the catastrophe had\r\ntaken place, when a sailor, perched on the main-top-gallant\r\ncrosstrees, watching the sea, cried suddenly:\r\n\r\n\"A buoy on the lee bow!\"\r\n\r\nThe officers looked in the direction indicated, and by the help\r\nof their glasses saw that the object signalled had the\r\nappearance of one of those buoys which are used to mark the\r\npassages of bays or rivers.  But, singularly to say, a flag\r\nfloating on the wind surmounted its cone, which emerged five\r\nor six feet out of water.  This buoy shone under the rays\r\nof the sun as if it had been made of plates of silver.\r\nCommander Blomsberry, J. T. Maston, and the delegates of the Gun\r\nClub were mounted on the bridge, examining this object straying\r\nat random on the waves.\r\n\r\nAll looked with feverish anxiety, but in silence.  None dared\r\ngive expression to the thoughts which came to the minds of all.\r\n\r\nThe corvette approached to within two cables' lengths of the object.\r\n\r\nA shudder ran through the whole crew.  That flag was the\r\nAmerican flag!\r\n\r\nAt this moment a perfect howling was heard; it was the brave J.\r\nT. Maston who had just fallen all in a heap.  Forgetting on the\r\none hand that his right arm had been replaced by an iron hook,\r\nand on the other that a simple gutta-percha cap covered his\r\nbrain-box, he had given himself a formidable blow.\r\n\r\nThey hurried toward him, picked him up, restored him to life.\r\nAnd what were his first words?\r\n\r\n\"Ah! trebly brutes! quadruply idiots! quintuply boobies that we are!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" exclaimed everyone around him.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, speak!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, simpletons,\" howled the terrible secretary, \"it is that\r\nthe projectile only weighs 19,250 pounds!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"And that it displaces twenty-eight tons, or in other words\r\n56,000 pounds, and that consequently _it floats_!\"\r\n\r\nAh! what stress the worthy man had laid on the verb \"float!\"\r\nAnd it was true!  All, yes! all these savants had forgotten\r\nthis fundamental law, namely, that on account of its specific\r\nlightness, the projectile, after having been drawn by its fall\r\nto the greatest depths of the ocean, must naturally return to\r\nthe surface.  And now it was floating quietly at the mercy of\r\nthe waves.\r\n\r\nThe boats were put to sea.  J. T. Maston and his friends had\r\nrushed into them!  Excitement was at its height!  Every heart\r\nbeat loudly while they advanced to the projectile.  What did\r\nit contain?  Living or dead?\r\n\r\nLiving, yes! living, at least unless death had struck\r\nBarbicane and his two friends since they had hoisted the flag.\r\nProfound silence reigned on the boats.  All were breathless.\r\nEyes no longer saw.  One of the scuttles of the projectile was open.\r\nSome pieces of glass remained in the frame, showing that it had\r\nbeen broken.  This scuttle was actually five feet above the water.\r\n\r\nA boat came alongside, that of J. T. Maston, and J. T. Maston\r\nrushed to the broken window.\r\n\r\nAt that moment they heard a clear and merry voice, the voice of\r\nMichel Ardan, exclaiming in an accent of triumph:\r\n\r\n\"White all, Barbicane, white all!\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane, Michel Ardan, and Nicholl were playing at dominoes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may remember the intense sympathy which had accompanied the\r\ntravelers on their departure.  If at the beginning of the\r\nenterprise they had excited such emotion both in the old and\r\nnew world, with what enthusiasm would they be received on\r\ntheir return!  The millions of spectators which had beset\r\nthe peninsula of Florida, would they not rush to meet these\r\nsublime adventurers?  Those legions of strangers, hurrying from\r\nall parts of the globe toward the American shores, would they\r\nleave the Union without having seen Barbicane, Nicholl, and\r\nMichel Ardan?  No! and the ardent passion of the public was\r\nbound to respond worthily to the greatness of the enterprise.\r\nHuman creatures who had left the terrestrial sphere, and returned\r\nafter this strange voyage into celestial space, could not fail\r\nto be received as the prophet Elias would be if he came back\r\nto earth.  To see them first, and then to hear them, such was\r\nthe universal longing.\r\n\r\nBarbicane, Michel Ardan, Nicholl, and the delegates of the Gun\r\nClub, returning without delay to Baltimore, were received with\r\nindescribable enthusiasm.  The notes of President Barbicane's\r\nvoyage were ready to be given to the public.  The New York\r\n_Herald_ bought the manuscript at a price not yet known, but\r\nwhich must have been very high.  Indeed, during the publication\r\nof \"A Journey to the Moon,\" the sale of this paper amounted to\r\nfive millions of copies.  Three days after the return of\r\nthe travelers to the earth, the slightest detail of their\r\nexpedition was known.  There remained nothing more but to see\r\nthe heroes of this superhuman enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe expedition of Barbicane and his friends round the moon had\r\nenabled them to correct the many admitted theories regarding the\r\nterrestrial satellite.  These savants had observed _de visu_,\r\nand under particular circumstances.  They knew what systems\r\nshould be rejected, what retained with regard to the formation\r\nof that orb, its origin, its habitability.  Its past, present,\r\nand future had even given up their last secrets.  Who could\r\nadvance objections against conscientious observers, who at less\r\nthan twenty-four miles distance had marked that curious mountain\r\nof Tycho, the strangest system of lunar orography?  How answer\r\nthose savants whose sight had penetrated the abyss of\r\nPluto's circle?  How contradict those bold ones whom the chances\r\nof their enterprise had borne over that invisible face of the\r\ndisc, which no human eye until then had ever seen?  It was now\r\ntheir turn to impose some limit on that selenographic science,\r\nwhich had reconstructed the lunar world as Cuvier did the\r\nskeleton of a fossil, and say, \"The moon _was_ this, a habitable\r\nworld, inhabited before the earth.  The moon _is_ that, a world\r\nuninhabitable, and now uninhabited.\"\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the return of its most illustrious member and his\r\ntwo companions, the Gun Club decided upon giving a banquet, but\r\na banquet worthy of the conquerors, worthy of the American\r\npeople, and under such conditions that all the inhabitants of\r\nthe Union could directly take part in it.\r\n\r\nAll the head lines of railroads in the States were joined by\r\nflying rails; and on all the platforms, lined with the same\r\nflags, and decorated with the same ornaments, were tables laid\r\nand all served alike.  At certain hours, successively\r\ncalculated, marked by electric clocks which beat the seconds at\r\nthe same time, the population were invited to take their places\r\nat the banquet tables.  For four days, from the 5th to the 9th\r\nof January, the trains were stopped as they are on Sundays on\r\nthe railways of the United States, and every road was open.\r\nOne engine only at full speed, drawing a triumphal carriage, had\r\nthe right of traveling for those four days on the railroads of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe engine was manned by a driver and a stoker, and bore, by\r\nspecial favor, the Hon. J. T. Maston, secretary of the Gun Club.\r\nThe carriage was reserved for President Barbicane, Colonel\r\nNicholl, and Michel Ardan.  At the whistle of the driver, amid\r\nthe hurrahs, and all the admiring vociferations of the American\r\nlanguage, the train left the platform of Baltimore.  It traveled\r\nat a speed of one hundred and sixty miles in the hour.  But what\r\nwas this speed compared with that which had carried the three\r\nheroes from the mouth of the Columbiad?\r\n\r\nThus they sped from one town to the other, finding whole\r\npopulations at table on their road, saluting them with the same\r\nacclamations, lavishing the same bravos!  They traveled in this\r\nway through the east of the Union, Pennsylvania, Connecticut,\r\nMassachusetts, Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire; the north and\r\nwest by New York, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin; returning to\r\nthe south by Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas, Texas, and Louisiana;\r\nthey went to the southeast by Alabama and Florida, going up by\r\nGeorgia and the Carolinas, visiting the center by Tennessee,\r\nKentucky, Virginia, and Indiana, and, after quitting the\r\nWashington station, re-entered Baltimore, where for four days\r\none would have thought that the United States of America were\r\nseated at one immense banquet, saluting them simultaneously with\r\nthe same hurrahs!  The apotheosis was worthy of these three\r\nheroes whom fable would have placed in the rank of demigods.\r\n\r\nAnd now will this attempt, unprecedented in the annals of\r\ntravels, lead to any practical result?  Will direct\r\ncommunication with the moon ever be established?  Will they\r\never lay the foundation of a traveling service through the\r\nsolar world?  Will they go from one planet to another, from\r\nJupiter to Mercury, and after awhile from one star to another,\r\nfrom the Polar to Sirius?  Will this means of locomotion allow\r\nus to visit those suns which swarm in the firmament?\r\n\r\nTo such questions no answer can be given.  But knowing the bold\r\ningenuity of the Anglo-Saxon race, no one would be astonished if\r\nthe Americans seek to make some use of President Barbicane's attempt.\r\n\r\nThus, some time after the return of the travelers, the public\r\nreceived with marked favor the announcement of a company,\r\nlimited, with a capital of a hundred million of dollars, divided\r\ninto a hundred thousand shares of a thousand dollars each, under\r\nthe name of the \"National Company of Interstellary Communication.\"\r\nPresident, Barbicane; vice-president, Captain Nicholl; secretary,\r\nJ. T. Maston; director of movements, Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\nAnd as it is part of the American temperament to foresee\r\neverything in business, even failure, the Honorable Harry\r\nTrolloppe, judge commissioner, and Francis Drayton, magistrate,\r\nwere nominated beforehand!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n******* Notes:\r\nJules Verne's \"From the Earth to the Moon\" and \"A Trip Around It\"\r\n>\r\n>I originally intended to \"correct\" some of the numbers in the book.\r\n>For example, page 207 has \"thirteenth\" where \"thirtieth\" would be\r\n>more appropriate.  Some of the densities and volumes and masses don't\r\n>match up.  The business with the wrong exhaust velocity of the gun\r\n>is also a bit confusing.  The dates and times aren't quite consistent\r\n>throughout, although they are close enough that Verne must have been\r\n>working from a time-line.  For example, I think he has the time for\r\n>the fall back to earth exactly matching the time for the trip out.\r\n>There are also inconsistent spellings, for example \"aluminum\" and\r\n>\"aluminium\".  Some of these annoyed me, in the sense of disturbing\r\n>my reading; since the reader is reading for pleasure, the annoyance\r\n>should be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll cases of the British? spelling of aluminium have been changed\r\nto the American spelling aluminum.\r\n\r\n\r\n>I decided that the correction project was going to be a lot of trouble,\r\n>and might be a perversion of the original work.  I concentrated instead\r\n>on producing an accurate rendition of the text.  However, if a French\r\n>speaker can find a French edition, it might be nice to see if the\r\n>translators introduced errors.  The measurements seem to have been\r\n>converted from metric without regard for significant figures.  Occasional\r\n>conversions are simply omitted, with \"feet\" inserted for \"meters\" without\r\n>fixing the numbers.  These might be safely recomputed without doing\r\n>violence to the spirit of the original work.  Whether one should\r\n>standardize the spelling of \"aluminium\" I don't know.  \"Aluminium\"\r\n>has a certain charm.  I don't know what American or English usage was\r\n>at the time.  We might consider converting all the temperatures to\r\n>Fahrenheit.  I suggest removing the page numbers, undoing all the\r\n>hyphenation, and repackaging the lines at a length of (up to) 72\r\n>characters,\r\n>with only occasional word breaks.\r\n\r\n\r\nPage #s and a full reformating has been done.  Line widow/orphans\r\nhave been painstakingly removed.  Hypenated words at the end of lines\r\nhave been eliminated to the best of my judgement.\r\n\r\n\r\n>I think a table of units should be offered for the reader.\r\n>myriameter = 10 km\r\n>fathom = 6 feet; league ~ 3 miles, but don't know French usage in 1865.\r\n>page 125 has perigee  86,410 leagues (French), or 238,833 miles <mean>\r\n>Would be nice to know the currency conversions of the day.\r\n>\r\n>We may criticize Verne for his errors, but the remarkable thing is\r\n>how much he got right!
