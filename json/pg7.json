The US has twice\r\nas many lawyers as the rest of the world combined!\r\n\r\nYou are free to delete the headers and just keep the Etexts, we\r\nare not free not to post it this way.  Again my apologies.  The\r\nnormal Project Gutenberg blurb has been deleted, you can get it\r\nin this location in most Project Gutenberg Etexts.
