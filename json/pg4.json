FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS*Ver.04.29.93*END*\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of the original Project Gutenberg Etexts from the\r\n1970's were produced in ALL CAPS, no lower case.  The\r\ncomputers we used then didn't have lower case at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a retranscription of one of the first Project\r\nGutenberg Etexts, offically dated December 31, 1974--\r\nand now officially re-released on November 19, 1993--\r\n130 years after it was spoken.  We will rerelease the\r\nInaugural Address of President Kennedy, officially on\r\nNovember 22, 1993, on the day of the 30th anniversary\r\nof his assassination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLincoln's Gettysburg Address, given November 19, 1863\r\non the battlefield near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, USA\r\n\r\n\r\nFour score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth\r\nupon this continent a new nation:  conceived in liberty, and\r\ndedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\r\n\r\nNow we are engaged in a great civil war. . .testing whether\r\nthat nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated. . .\r\ncan long endure.  We are met on a great battlefield of that war.\r\n\r\nWe have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place\r\nfor those who here gave their lives that this nation might live.\r\nIt is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.\r\n\r\nBut, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate. . .we cannot consecrate. . .\r\nwe cannot hallow this ground.  The brave men, living and dead,\r\nwho struggled here have consecrated it, far above our poor power\r\nto add or detract.  The world will little note, nor long remember,\r\nwhat we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.\r\n\r\nIt is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished\r\nwork which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.\r\nIt is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining\r\nbefore us. . .that from these honored dead we take increased devotion\r\nto that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion. . .\r\nthat we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain. . .\r\nthat this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom. . .\r\nand that government of the people. . .by the people. . .for the people. . .\r\nshall not perish from this earth.\r\n\r\n"
