There was more to his name than that, for old\r\nMombi often declared that his whole name was Tippetarius; but no one was\r\nexpected to say such a long word when \"Tip\" would do just as well.\r\n\r\nThis boy remembered nothing of his parents, for he had been brought when\r\nquite young to be reared by the old woman known as Mombi, whose reputation,\r\nI am sorry to say, was none of the best. For the Gillikin people had reason\r\nto suspect her of indulging in magical arts, and therefore hesitated to\r\nassociate with her.\r\n\r\nMombi was not exactly a Witch, because the Good Witch who ruled that part of\r\nthe Land of Oz\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8                    Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\nhad forbidden any other Witch to exist in her dominions. So Tip's guardian,\r\nhowever much she might aspire to working magic, realized it was unlawful to\r\nbe more than a Sorceress, or at most a Wizardess.\r\n\r\nTip was made to carry wood from the forest, that the old woman might boil\r\nher pot. He also worked in the corn-fields, hoeing and husking; and he fed\r\nthe pigs and milked the four-horned cow that was Mombi's especial pride.\r\n\r\nBut you must not suppose he worked all the time, for he felt that would be\r\nbad for him. When sent to the forest Tip often climbed trees for birds' eggs\r\nor amused himself chasing the fleet white rabbits or fishing in the brooks\r\nwith bent pins. Then he would hastily gather his armful of wood and carry it\r\nhome. And when he was supposed to be working in the corn-fields, and the\r\ntall stalks hid him from Mombi's view, Tip would often dig in the gopher\r\nholes, or if the mood seized him--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\nlie upon his back between the rows of corn and take a nap. So, by taking\r\ncare not to exhaust his strength, he grew as strong and rugged as a boy may\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nMombi's curious magic often frightened her neighbors, and they treated her\r\nshyly, yet respectfully, because of her weird powers. But Tip frankly hated\r\nher, and took no pains to hide his feelings. Indeed, he sometimes showed\r\nless respect for the old woman than he should have done, considering she was\r\nhis guardian.\r\n\r\nThere were pumpkins in Mombi's corn-fields, lying golden red among the rows\r\nof green stalks; and these had been planted and carefully tended that the\r\nfour-horned cow might eat of them in the winter time. But one day, after the\r\ncorn had all been cut and stacked, and Tip was carrying the pumpkins to the\r\nstable, he took a notion to make a \"Jack Lantern\" and try to give the old\r\nwoman a fright with it.\r\n\r\nSo he selected a fine, big pumpkin--one with a lustrous, orange-red color--and\r\nbegan carving it. With the point of his knife he made two round eyes,\r\na three-cornered nose, and\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\na mouth shaped like a new moon. The face, when completed, could not have\r\nbeen considered strictly beautiful; but it wore a smile so big and broad,\r\nand was so jolly in expression, that even Tip laughed as he looked\r\nadmiringly at his work.\r\n\r\nThe child had no playmates, so he did not know that boys often dig out the\r\ninside of a \"pumpkin-jack,\" and in the space thus made put a lighted candle\r\nto render the face more startling; but he conceived an idea of his own that\r\npromised to be quite as effective. He decided to manufacture the form of a\r\nman, who would wear this pumpkin head, and to stand it in a place where old\r\nMombi would meet it face to face.\r\n\r\n\"And then,\" said Tip to himself, with a laugh, \"she'll squeal louder than\r\nthe brown pig does when I pull her tail, and shiver with fright worse than I\r\ndid last year when I had the ague!\"\r\n\r\nHe had plenty of time to accomplish this task, for Mombi had gone to a\r\nvillage--to buy groceries, she said--and it was a journey of at least\r\ntwo days.\r\n\r\nSo he took his axe to the forest, and selected some stout, straight\r\nsaplings, which he cut down and trimmed of all their twigs and leaves. From\r\nthese he would make the arms, and legs, and feet of his man. For the body he\r\nstripped a sheet of thick\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\nbark from around a big tree, and with much labor fashioned it into a\r\ncylinder of about the right size, pinning the edges together with wooden\r\npegs. Then, whistling happily as he worked, he carefully jointed the limbs\r\nand fastened them to the body with pegs whittled into shape with his knife.\r\n\r\nBy the time this feat had been accomplished it began to grow dark, and Tip\r\nremembered he must milk the cow and feed the pigs. So he picked up his\r\nwooden man and carried it back to the house with him.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening, by the light of the fire in the kitchen, Tip carefully\r\nrounded all the edges of the joints and smoothed the rough places in a neat\r\nand workmanlike manner. Then he stood the figure up against the wall and\r\nadmired it. It seemed remarkably tall, even for a full-grown man; but that\r\nwas a good point in a small boy's eyes, and Tip did not object at all to the\r\nsize of his creation.\r\n\r\nNext morning, when he looked at his work again, Tip saw he had forgotten to\r\ngive the dummy a neck, by means of which he might fasten the pumpkinhead to\r\nthe body. So he went again to the forest, which was not far away, and\r\nchopped from a tree several pieces of wood with which to complete his work.\r\nWhen he returned he fastened a cross-piece\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12\r\nto the upper end of the body, making a hole through the center to hold\r\nupright the neck. The bit of wood which formed this neck was also sharpened\r\nat the upper end, and when all was ready Tip put on the pumpkin head,\r\npressing it well down onto the neck, and found that it fitted very well. The\r\nhead could be turned to one side or the other, as he pleased, and the hinges\r\nof the arms and legs allowed him to place the dummy in any position he\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\n\"Now, that,\" declared Tip, proudly, \"is really a very fine man, and it\r\nought to frighten several screeches out of old Mombi! But it would be much\r\nmore lifelike if it were properly dressed.\"\r\n\r\nTo find clothing seemed no easy task; but Tip boldly ransacked the great\r\nchest in which Mombi kept all her keepsakes and treasures, and at the very\r\nbottom he discovered some purple trousers, a red shirt and a pink vest which\r\nwas dotted with white spots. These he carried away to his man and succeeded,\r\nalthough the garments did not fit very well, in dressing the creature in a\r\njaunty fashion. Some knit stockings belonging to Mombi and a much worn pair\r\nof his own shoes completed the man's apparel, and Tip was so delighted that\r\nhe danced up and down and laughed aloud in boyish ecstacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\n\"I must give him a name!\" he cried. \"So good a man as this must surely have\r\na name. I believe,\" he added, after a moment's thought, \"I will name the\r\nfellow 'Jack Pumpkinhead!'\"\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15               The Marvelous Powder of Life\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter considering the matter carefully, Tip decided that the best place to\r\nlocate Jack would be at the bend in the road, a little way from the house.\r\nSo he started to carry his man there, but found him heavy and rather awkward\r\nto handle. After dragging the creature a short distance Tip stood him on his\r\nfeet, and by first bending the joints of one leg, and then those of the\r\nother, at the same time pushing from behind, the boy managed to induce Jack\r\nto walk to the bend in the road. It was not accomplished without a few\r\ntumbles, and Tip really worked harder than he ever had in the fields or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16\r\nforest; but a love of mischief urged him on, and it pleased him to test the\r\ncleverness of his workmanship.\r\n\r\n\"Jack's all right, and works fine!\" he said to himself, panting with the\r\nunusual exertion. But just then he discovered the man's left arm had fallen\r\noff in the journey so he went back to find it, and afterward, by whittling a\r\nnew and stouter pin for the shoulder-joint, he repaired the injury so\r\nsuccessfully that the arm was stronger than before. Tip also noticed that\r\nJack's pumpkin head had twisted around until it faced his back; but this was\r\neasily remedied. When, at last, the man was set up facing the turn in the\r\npath where old Mombi was to appear, he looked natural enough to be a fair\r\nimitation of a Gillikin farmer,--and unnatural enough to startle anyone\r\nthat came on him unawares.\r\n\r\nAs it was yet too early in the day to expect the old woman to return home,\r\nTip went down into the valley below the farm-house and began to gather nuts\r\nfrom the trees that grew there.\r\n\r\nHowever, old Mombi returned earlier than usual. She had met a crooked\r\nwizard who resided in a lonely cave in the mountains, and had traded\r\nseveral important secrets of magic with him. Hav-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17\r\ning in this way secured three new recipes, four magical powders and a\r\nselection of herbs of wonderful power and potency, she hobbled home as fast\r\nas she could, in order to test her new sorceries.\r\n\r\nSo intent was Mombi on the treasures she had gained that when she turned the\r\nbend in the road and caught a glimpse of the man, she merely nodded and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Good evening, sir.\"\r\n\r\nBut, a moment after, noting that the person did not move or reply, she cast\r\na shrewd glance into his face and discovered his pumpkin head elaborately\r\ncarved by Tip's jack-knife.\r\n\r\n\"Heh!\" ejaculated Mombi, giving a sort of grunt; \"that rascally boy has\r\nbeen playing tricks again! Very good! ve--ry good! I'll beat him black-\r\nand-blue for trying to scare me in this fashion!\"\r\n\r\nAngrily she raised her stick to smash in the grinning pumpkin head of the\r\ndummy; but a sudden thought made her pause, the uplifted stick left\r\nmotionless in the air.\r\n\r\n\"Why, here is a good chance to try my new powder!\" said she, eagerly. \"And\r\nthen I can tell whether that crooked wizard has fairly traded secrets, or\r\nwhether he has fooled me as wickedly as I fooled him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\nSo she set down her basket and began fumbling in it for one of the precious\r\npowders she had obtained.\r\n\r\nWhile Mombi was thus occupied Tip strolled back, with his pockets full of\r\nnuts, and discovered the old woman standing beside his man and apparently\r\nnot the least bit frightened by it.\r\n\r\nAt first he was generally disappointed; but the next moment he became\r\ncurious to know what Mombi was going to do. So he hid behind a hedge, where\r\nhe could see without being seen, and prepared to watch.\r\n\r\nAfter some search the woman drew from her basket an old pepper-box, upon the\r\nfaded label of which the wizard had written with a lead-pencil:\r\n\r\n\"Powder of Life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah--here it is!\" she cried, joyfully. \"And now let us see if it is\r\npotent. The stingy wizard didn't give me much of it, but I guess there's\r\nenough for two or three doses.\"\r\n\r\nTip was much surprised when he overheard this speech. Then he saw old Mombi\r\nraise her arm and sprinkle the powder from the box over the pumpkin head of\r\nhis man Jack. She did this in the same way one would pepper a baked potato,\r\nand the powder sifted down from Jack's head and scattered\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n               \"OLD MOMBI DANCED AROUND HIM\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20\r\nover the red shirt and pink waistcoat and purple trousers Tip had dressed\r\nhim in, and a portion even fell upon the patched and worn shoes.\r\n\r\nThen, putting the pepper-box back into the basket, Mombi lifted her left\r\nhand, with its little finger pointed upward, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Weaugh!\"\r\n\r\nThen she lifted her right hand, with the thumb pointed upward, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Teaugh!\"\r\n\r\nThen she lifted both hands, with all the fingers and thumbs spread out, and\r\ncried:\r\n\r\n\"Peaugh!\"\r\n\r\nJack Pumpkinhead stepped back a pace, at this, and said in a reproachful\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\"Don't yell like that! Do you think I'm deaf?\"\r\n\r\nOld Mombi danced around him, frantic with delight.\r\n\r\n\"He lives!\" she screamed: \"He lives! he lives!\"\r\n\r\nThen she threw her stick into the air and caught it as it came down; and she\r\nhugged herself with both arms, and tried to do a step of a jig; and all the\r\ntime she repeated, rapturously:\r\n\r\n\"He lives!--he lives!--he lives!\"\r\n\r\nNow you may well suppose that Tip observed all this with amazement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21\r\n\r\nAt first he was so frightened and horrified that he wanted to run away, but\r\nhis legs trembled and shook so badly that he couldn't. Then it struck him as\r\na very funny thing for Jack to come to life, especially as the expression on\r\nhis pumpkin face was so droll and comical it excited laughter on the\r\ninstant. So, recovering from his first fear, Tip began to laugh; and the\r\nmerry peals reached old Mombi's ears and made her hobble quickly to the\r\nhedge, where she seized Tip's collar and dragged him back to where she had\r\nleft her basket and the pumpkinheaded man.\r\n\r\n\"You naughty, sneaking, wicked boy!\" she exclaimed, furiously: \"I'll teach\r\nyou to spy out my secrets and to make fun of me!\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't making fun of you,\" protested Tip. \"I was laughing at old\r\nPumpkinhead! Look at him! Isn't he a picture, though?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you are not reflecting on my personal appearance,\" said Jack; and it\r\nwas so funny to hear his grave voice, while his face continued to wear its\r\njolly smile, that Tip again burst into a peal of laughter.\r\n\r\nEven Mombi was not without a curious interest in the man her magic had\r\nbrought to life; for, after staring at him intently, she presently asked:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n               OLD MOMBI PUTS JACK IN THE STABLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23\r\n\r\n\"What do you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is hard to tell,\" replied Jack. \"For although I feel that I\r\nknow a tremendous lot, I am not yet aware how much there is in the world to\r\nfind out about. It will take me a little time to discover whether I am very\r\nwise or very foolish.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure,\" said Mombi, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"But what are you going to do with him, now he is alive?\" asked Tip,\r\nwondering.\r\n\r\n\"I must think it over,\" answered Mombi. \"But we must get home at once, for\r\nit is growing dark. Help the Pumpkinhead to walk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind me,\" said Jack; \"I can walk as well as you can. Haven't I got\r\nlegs and feet, and aren't they jointed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they?\" asked the woman, turning to Tip.\r\n\r\n\"Of course they are; I made 'em myself,\" returned the boy, with pride.\r\n\r\nSo they started for the house, but when they reached the farm yard old\r\nMombi led the pumpkin man to the cow stable and shut him up in an empty\r\nstall, fastening the door securely on the outside.\r\n\r\n\"I've got to attend to you, first,\" she said, nodding her head at Tip.\r\n\r\nHearing this, the boy became uneasy; for he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24\r\nknew Mombi had a bad and revengeful heart, and would not hesitate to do any\r\nevil thing.\r\n\r\nThey entered the house. It was a round, domeshaped structure, as are nearly\r\nall the farm houses in the Land of Oz.\r\n\r\nMombi bade the boy light a candle, while she put her basket in a cupboard\r\nand hung her cloak on a peg. Tip obeyed quickly, for he was afraid of her.\r\n\r\nAfter the candle had been lighted Mombi ordered him to build a fire in the\r\nhearth, and while Tip was thus engaged the old woman ate her supper. When\r\nthe flames began to crackle the boy came to her and asked a share of the\r\nbread and cheese; but Mombi refused him.\r\n\r\n\"I'm hungry!\" said Tip, in a sulky tone.\r\n\r\n\"You won't be hungry long,\" replied Mombi, with a grim look.\r\n\r\nThe boy didn't like this speech, for it sounded like a threat; but he\r\nhappened to remember he had nuts in his pocket, so he cracked some of those\r\nand ate them while the woman rose, shook the crumbs from her apron, and hung\r\nabove the fire a small black kettle.\r\n\r\nThen she measured out equal parts of milk and vinegar and poured them into\r\nthe kettle. Next she\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25\r\nproduced several packets of herbs and powders and began adding a portion of\r\neach to the contents of the kettle. Occasionally she would draw near the\r\ncandle and read from a yellow paper the recipe of the mess she was\r\nconcocting.\r\n\r\nAs Tip watched her his uneasiness increased.\r\n\r\n\"What is that for?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"For you,\" returned Mombi, briefly.\r\n\r\nTip wriggled around upon his stool and stared awhile at the kettle, which\r\nwas beginning to bubble. Then he would glance at the stern and wrinkled\r\nfeatures of the witch and wish he were any place but in that dim and smoky\r\nkitchen, where even the shadows cast by the candle upon the wall were enough\r\nto give one the horrors. So an hour passed away, during which the silence\r\nwas only broken by the bubbling of the pot and the hissing of the flames.\r\n\r\nFinally, Tip spoke again.\r\n\r\n\"Have I got to drink that stuff?\" he asked, nodding toward the pot.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mombi.\r\n\r\n\"What'll it do to me?\" asked Tip.\r\n\r\n\"If it's properly made,\" replied Mombi, \"it will change or transform you\r\ninto a marble statue.\"\r\n\r\nTip groaned, and wiped the perspiration from his forehead with his sleeve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to be a marble statue!\" he protested.\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't matter I want you to be one,\" said the old woman, looking at\r\nhim severely.\r\n\r\n\"What use'll I be then?\" asked Tip. \"There won't be any one to work for\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll make the Pumpkinhead work for me,\" said Mombi.\r\n\r\nAgain Tip groaned.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you change me into a goat, or a chicken?\" he asked, anxiously.\r\n\"You can't do anything with a marble statue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I can,\" returned Mombi. \"I'm going to plant a flower garden, next\r\nSpring, and I'll put you in the middle of it, for an ornament. I wonder I\r\nhaven't thought of that before; you've been a bother to me for years.\"\r\n\r\nAt this terrible speech Tip felt the beads of perspiration starting all\r\nover his body, but he sat still and shivered and looked anxiously at the\r\nkettle.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it won't work,\" he mutttered, in a voice that sounded weak and\r\ndiscouraged.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I think it will,\" answered Mombi, cheerfully. \"I seldom make a\r\nmistake.\"\r\n\r\nAgain there was a period of silence a silence so long and gloomy that when\r\nMombi finally lifted the kettle from the fire it was close to midnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n               \"I DON'T WANT TO BE A MARBLE STATUE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n28\r\n\r\n\"You cannot drink it until it has become quite cold,\" announced the old\r\nwitch for in spite of the law she had acknowledged practising witchcraft.\r\n\"We must both go to bed now, and at daybreak I will call you and at once\r\ncomplete your transformation into a marble statue.\"\r\n\r\nWith this she hobbled into her room, bearing the steaming kettle with her,\r\nand Tip heard her close and lock the door.\r\n\r\nThe boy did not go to bed, as he had been commanded to do, but still sat\r\nglaring at the embers of the dying fire.\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n29               The Flight of the Fugitives\r\n\r\n\r\nTip reflected.\r\n\r\n\"It's a hard thing, to be a marble statue,\" he thought, rebelliously, \"and\r\nI'm not going to stand it. For years I've been a bother to her, she says; so\r\nshe's going to get rid of me. Well, there's an easier way than to become a\r\nstatue. No boy could have any fun forever standing in the middle of a flower\r\ngarden! I'll run away, that's what I'll do--and I may as well go before\r\nshe makes me drink that nasty stuff in the kettle.\" He waited until the\r\nsnores of the old witch announced she was fast asleep, and then he arose\r\nsoftly and went to the cupboard to find something to eat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30\r\n\r\n\"No use starting on a journey without food,\" he decided, searching upon the\r\nnarrow shelves.\r\n\r\nHe found some crusts of bread; but he had to look into Mombi's basket to\r\nfind the cheese she had brought from the village. While turning over the\r\ncontents of the basket he came upon the pepper-box which contained the\r\n\"Powder of Life.\"\r\n\r\n\"I may as well take this with me,\" he thought, \"or Mombi'll be using it to\r\nmake more mischief with.\" So he put the box in his pocket, together with the\r\nbread and cheese.\r\n\r\nThen he cautiously left the house and latched the door behind him. Outside\r\nboth moon and stars shone brightly, and the night seemed peaceful and\r\ninviting after the close and ill-smelling kitchen.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be glad to get away,\" said Tip, softly; \"for I never did like that old\r\nwoman. I wonder how I ever came to live with her.\"\r\n\r\nHe was walking slowly toward the road when a thought made him pause.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like to leave Jack Pumpkinhead to the tender mercies of old Mombi,\"\r\nhe muttered. \"And Jack belongs to me, for I made him even if the old witch\r\ndid bring him to life.\"\r\n\r\nHe retraced his steps to the cow-stable and opened the door of the stall\r\nwhere the pumpkin-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n31               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n               \"TIP LED HIM ALONG THE PATH.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n32\r\nheaded man had been left.\r\n\r\nJack was standing in the middle of the stall, and by the moonlight Tip could\r\nsee he was smiling just as jovially as ever.\r\n\r\n\"Come on!\" said the boy, beckoning.\r\n\r\n\"Where to?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"You'll know as soon as I do,\" answered Tip, smiling sympathetically into\r\nthe pumpkin face.\r\n\r\n\"All we've got to do now is to tramp.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" returned Jack, and walked awkwardly out of the stable and into\r\nthe moonlight.\r\n\r\nTip turned toward the road and the man followed him. Jack walked with a sort\r\nof limp, and occasionally one of the joints of his legs would turn backward,\r\ninstead of frontwise, almost causing him to tumble. But the Pumpkinhead was\r\nquick to notice this, and began to take more pains to step carefully; so\r\nthat he met with few accidents.\r\n\r\nTip led him along the path without stopping an instant. They could not go\r\nvery fast, but they walked steadily; and by the time the moon sank away and\r\nthe sun peeped over the hills they had travelled so great a distance that\r\nthe boy had no reason to fear pursuit from the old witch. Moreover, he had\r\nturned first into one path, and then into another, so that should anyone\r\nfollow them it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n33\r\nwould prove very difficult to guess which way they had gone, or where to\r\nseek them.\r\n\r\nFairly satisfied that he had escaped--for a time, at least--being turned\r\ninto a marble statue, the boy stopped his companion and seated himself upon\r\na rock by the roadside.\r\n\r\n\"Let's have some breakfast,\" he said.\r\n\r\nJack Pumpkinhead watched Tip curiously, but refused to join in the repast.\r\n\"I don't seem to be made the same way you are,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I know you are not,\" returned Tip; \"for I made you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Did you?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. And put you together. And carved your eyes and nose and ears and\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing along the right side of the page\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n34\r\n\r\nmouth,\" said Tip proudly. \"And dressed you.\"\r\n\r\nJack looked at his body and limbs critically.\r\n\r\n\"It strikes me you made a very good job of it,\" he remarked.\r\n\r\n\"Just so-so,\" replied Tip, modestly; for he began to see certain defects in\r\nthe construction of his man. \"If I'd known we were going to travel together\r\nI might have been a little more particular.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then,\" said the Pumpkinhead, in a tone that expressed surprise, \"you\r\nmust be my creator my parent my father!\"\r\n\r\n\"Or your inventor,\" replied the boy with a laugh. \"Yes, my son; I really\r\nbelieve I am!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I owe you obedience,\" continued the man, \"and you owe me--support.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it, exactly\", declared Tip, jumping up. \"So let us be off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are we going?\" asked Jack, when they had resumed their journey.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not exactly sure,\" said the boy; \"but I believe we are headed South,\r\nand that will bring us, sooner or later, to the Emerald City.\"\r\n\r\n\"What city is that?\" enquired the Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's the center of the Land of Oz, and the biggest town in all the\r\ncountry. I've never been there, myself, but I've heard all about its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n35\r\nhistory. It was built by a mighty and wonderful Wizard named Oz, and\r\neverything there is of a green color--just as everything in this Country\r\nof the Gillikins is of a purple color.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is everything here purple?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it is. Can't you see?\" returned the boy.\r\n\r\n\"I believe I must be color-blind,\" said the Pumpkinhead, after staring about\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the grass is purple, and the trees are purple, and the houses and\r\nfences are purple,\" explained Tip. \"Even the mud in the roads is purple. But\r\nin the Emerald City everything is green that is purple here. And in the\r\nCountry of the Munchkins, over at the East, everything is blue; and in the\r\nSouth country of the Quadlings everything is red; and in the West country of\r\nthe Winkies, where the Tin Woodman rules, everything is yellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Jack. Then, after a pause, he asked: \"Did you say a Tin Woodman\r\nrules the Winkies?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; he was one of those who helped Dorothy to destroy the Wicked Witch of\r\nthe West, and the Winkies were so grateful that they invited him to become\r\ntheir ruler,--just as the people of the Emerald City invited the Scarecrow\r\nto rule them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" said Jack. \"I'm getting confused with all this history. Who is\r\nthe Scarecrow?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n36\r\n\r\n\"Another friend of Dorothy's,\" replied Tip.\r\n\r\n\"And who is Dorothy?\"\r\n\r\n\"She was a girl that came here from Kansas, a place in the big, outside\r\nWorld. She got blown to the Land of Oz by a cyclone, and while she was here\r\nthe Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman accompanied her on her travels.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where is she now?\" inquired the Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n\"Glinda the Good, who rules the Quadlings, sent her home again,\" said the\r\nboy.\r\n\r\n\"Oh. And what became of the Scarecrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"I told you. He rules the Emerald City,\" answered Tip.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you said it was ruled by a wonderful Wizard,\" objected Jack,\r\nseeming more and more confused.\r\n\r\n\"Well, so I did. Now, pay attention, and I'll explain it,\" said Tip,\r\nspeaking slowly and looking the smiling Pumpkinhead squarely in the eye.\r\n\"Dorothy went to the Emerald City to ask the Wizard to send her back to\r\nKansas; and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman went with her. But the Wizard\r\ncouldn't send her back, because he wasn't so much of a Wizard as he might\r\nhave been. And then they got angry at the Wizard, and threatened\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n37\r\nto expose him; so the Wizard made a big balloon and escaped in it, and\r\nno one has ever seen him since.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, that is very interesting history,\" said Jack, well pleased; \"and I\r\nunderstand it perfectly all but the explanation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you do,\" responded Tip. \"After the Wizard was gone, the people of\r\nthe Emerald City made His Majesty, the Scarecrow, their King; \"and I have\r\nheard that he became a very popular ruler.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we going to see this queer King?\" asked Jack, with interest.\r\n\r\n\"I think we may as well,\" replied the boy; \"unless you have something better\r\nto do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, dear father,\" said the Pumpkinhead. \"I am quite willing to go\r\nwherever you please.\"\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n38               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n39               Tip Makes an Experiment in Magic\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boy, small and rather delicate in appearance seemed somewhat embarrassed\r\nat being called \"father\" by the tall, awkward, pumpkinheaded man, but to\r\ndeny the relationship would involve another long and tedious explanation; so\r\nhe changed the subject by asking, abruptly:\r\n\r\n\"Are you tired?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not!\" replied the other. \"But,\" he continued, after a pause, \"it\r\nis quite certain I shall  wear out my wooden joints if I keep on walking.\"\r\n\r\nTip reflected, as they journeyed on, that this was true. He began to regret\r\nthat he had not constructed the wooden limbs more carefully and\r\nsubstantially. Yet how could he ever have guessed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n40\r\nthat the man he had made merely to scare old Mombi with would be brought to\r\nlife by means of a magical powder contained in an old pepper-box?\r\n\r\nSo he ceased to reproach himself, and began to think how he might yet remedy\r\nthe deficiencies of Jack's weak joints.\r\n\r\nWhile thus engaged they came to the edge of a wood, and the boy sat down to\r\nrest upon an old sawhorse that some woodcutter had left there.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you sit down?\" he asked the Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n\"Won't it strain my joints?\" inquired the other.\r\n\r\n\"Of course not. It'll rest them,\" declared the boy.\r\n\r\nSo Jack tried to sit down; but as soon as he bent his joints farther than\r\nusual they gave way altogether, and he came clattering to the ground with\r\nsuch a crash that Tip feared he was entirely ruined.\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing along right side of this page\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n41\r\n\r\nHe rushed to the man, lifted him to his feet, straightened his arms and\r\nlegs, and felt of his head to see if by chance it had become cracked. But\r\nJack seemed to be in pretty good shape, after all, and Tip said to him:\r\n\r\n\"I guess you'd better remain standing, hereafter. It seems the safest way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, dear father.\" just as you say, replied the smiling Jack, who had\r\nbeen in no wise confused by his tumble.\r\n\r\nTip sat down again. Presently the Pumpkinhead asked:\r\n\r\n\"What is that thing you are sitting on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, this is a horse,\" replied the boy, carelessly.\r\n\r\n\"What is a horse?\" demanded Jack.\r\n\r\n\"A horse? Why, there are two kinds of horses,\" returned Tip, slightly\r\npuzzled how to explain. \"One kind of horse is alive, and has four legs and a\r\nhead and a tail. And people ride upon its back.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" said Jack, cheerfully \"That's the kind of horse you are now\r\nsitting on.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it isn't,\" answered Tip, promptly.\r\n\r\n\"Why not? That one has four legs, and a head, and a tail.\" Tip looked at the\r\nsaw-horse more carefully, and found that the Pumpkinhead was right. The body\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n42\r\nhad been formed from a tree-trunk, and a branch had been left sticking up at\r\none end that looked very much like a tail. In the other end were two big\r\nknots that resembled eyes, and a place had been chopped away that might\r\neasily be mistaken for the horse's mouth. As for the legs, they were four\r\nstraight limbs cut from trees and stuck fast into the body, being spread\r\nwide apart so that the saw-horse would stand firmly when a log was laid\r\nacross it to be sawed.\r\n\r\n\"This thing resembles a real horse more than I imagined,\" said Tip, trying\r\nto explain. \"But a real horse is alive, and trots and prances and eats oats,\r\nwhile this is nothing more than a dead horse, made of wood, and used to saw\r\nlogs upon.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it were alive, wouldn't it trot, and prance, and eat oats?\" inquired the\r\nPumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n\"It would trot and prance, perhaps; but it wouldn't eat oats,\" replied the\r\nboy, laughing at the idea.\" And of course it can't ever be alive, because it\r\nis made of wood.\"\r\n\r\n\"So am I,\" answered the man.\r\n\r\nTip looked at him in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Why, so you are!\" he exclaimed. \"And the magic powder that brought you to\r\nlife is here in my pocket.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n43               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n               THE MAGICAL POWDER OF LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n44\r\n\r\nHe brought out the pepper box, and eyed it curiously.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" said he, musingly, \"if it would bring the saw-horse to life.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it would,\" returned Jack, calmly for nothing seemed to surprise him\" I\r\ncould ride on its back, and that would save my joints from wearing out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll try it!\" cried the boy, jumping up. \"But I wonder if I can remember\r\nthe words old Mombi said, and the way she held her hands up.\"\r\n\r\nHe thought it over for a minute, and as he had watched carefully from the\r\nhedge every motion of the old witch, and listened to her words, he believed\r\nhe could repeat exactly what she had said and done.\r\n\r\nSo he began by sprinkling some of the magic Powder of Life from the pepper-\r\nbox upon the body of the saw-horse. Then he lifted his left hand, with the\r\nlittle finger pointing upward, and said: \"Weaugh!\"\r\n\r\n\"What does that mean, dear father?\" asked Jack, curiously.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" answered Tip. Then he lifted his right hand, with the thumb\r\npointing upward and said: \"Teaugh!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that, dear father?\" inquired Jack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n45\r\n\r\n\"It means you must keep quiet!\" replied the boy, provoked at being\r\ninterrupted at so important a moment.\r\n\r\n\"How fast I am learning!\" remarked the Pumpkinhead, with his eternal smile.\r\n\r\nTip now lifted both hands above his head, with all the fingers and thumbs\r\nspread out, and cried in a loud voice: \"Peaugh!\"\r\n\r\nImmediately the saw-horse moved, stretched its legs, yawned with its\r\nchopped-out mouth, and shook a few grains of the powder off its back. The\r\nrest of the powder seemed to have vanished into the body of the horse.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" called Jack, while the boy looked on in astonishment. \"You are a\r\nvery clever sorcerer, dear father!\"\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n46               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n47               The Awakening of the Saw-horse\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Saw-Horse, finding himself alive, seemed even more astonished than Tip.\r\nHe rolled his knotty eyes from side to side, taking a first wondering view\r\nof the world in which he had now so important an existence. Then he tried to\r\nlook at himself; but he had, indeed, no neck to turn; so that in the\r\nendeavor to see his body he kept circling around and around, without\r\ncatching even a glimpse of it. His legs were stiff and awkward, for there\r\nwere no knee-joints in them; so that presently he bumped against Jack\r\nPumpkinhead and sent that personage tumbling upon the moss that lined the\r\nroadside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n48\r\n\r\nTip became alarmed at this accident, as well as at the persistence of the\r\nSaw-Horse in prancing around in a circle; so he called out:\r\n\r\n\"Whoa! Whoa, there!\"\r\n\r\nThe Saw-Horse paid no attention whatever to this command, and the next\r\ninstant brought one of his wooden legs down upon Tip's foot so forcibly that\r\nthe boy danced away in pain to a safer distance, from where he again yelled:\r\n\r\n\"Whoa! Whoa, I say!\"\r\n\r\nJack had now managed to raise himself to a sitting position, and he looked\r\nat the Saw-Horse with much interest.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe the animal can hear you,\" he remarked.\r\n\r\n\"I shout loud enough, don't I?\" answered Tip, angrily.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but the horse has no ears,\" said the smiling Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n\"Sure enough!\" exclaimed Tip, noting the fact for the first time. \"How,\r\nthen, am I going to stop him?\"\r\n\r\nBut at that instant the Saw-Horse stopped himself, having concluded it was\r\nimpossible to see his own body. He saw Tip, however, and came close to the\r\nboy to observe him more fully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n49\r\n\r\nIt was really comical to see the creature walk; for it moved the legs on its\r\nright side together, and those on its left side together, as a pacing horse\r\ndoes; and that made its body rock sidewise, like a cradle.\r\n\r\nTip patted it upon the head, and said \"Good boy! Good Boy!\" in a coaxing\r\ntone; and the Saw-Horse pranced away to examine with its bulging eyes the\r\nform of Jack Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n\"I must find a halter for him,\" said Tip; and having made a search in his\r\npocket he produced a roll of strong cord. Unwinding this, he approached the\r\nSaw-Horse and tied the cord around its neck, afterward fastening the other\r\nend to a large tree. The Saw-Horse, not understanding the action, stepped\r\nbackward and snapped the string easily; but it made no attempt to run away.\r\n\r\n\"He's stronger than I thought,\" said the boy, \"and rather obstinate, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you make him some ears?\" asked Jack. \"Then you can tell him what\r\nto do.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a splendid idea!\" said Tip. \"How did you happen to think of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I didn't think of it,\" answered the Pumpkinhead; \"I didn't need to,\r\nfor it's the simplest and easiest thing to do.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n50\r\n\r\nSo Tip got out his knife and fashioned some ears out of the bark of a small\r\ntree.\r\n\r\n\"I mustn't make them too big,\" he said, as he whittled, \"or our horse would\r\nbecome a donkey.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is that?\" inquired Jack, from the roadside.\r\n\r\n\"Why, a horse has bigger ears than a man; and a donkey has bigger ears than\r\na horse,\" explained Tip.\r\n\r\n\"Then, if my ears were longer, would I be a horse?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"My friend,\" said Tip, gravely, \"you'll never be anything but a Pumpkinhead,\r\nno matter how big your ears are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" returned Jack, nodding; \"I think I understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you do, you're a wonder,\" remarked the boy  \"but there's no harm in\r\nthinking you understand. I guess these ears are ready now. Will you hold the\r\nhorse while I stick them on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, if you'll help me up,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\nSo Tip raised him to his feet, and the Pumpkinhead went to the horse and\r\nheld its head while the boy bored two holes in it with his knife-blade and\r\ninserted the ears.\r\n\r\n\"They make him look very handsome,\" said Jack, admiringly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n51\r\n\r\nBut those words, spoken close to the Saw-Horse, and being the first sounds\r\nhe had ever heard, so startled the animal that he made a bound forward and\r\ntumbled Tip on one side and Jack on the other. Then he continued to rush\r\nforward as if frightened by the clatter of his own foot-steps.\r\n\r\n\"Whoa!\" shouted Tip, picking himself up; \"whoa! you idiot whoa!\" The Saw-\r\nHorse would probably have paid no attention to this, but just then it\r\nstepped a leg into a gopher-hole and stumbled head-over-heels to the ground,\r\nwhere it lay upon its back, frantically waving its four legs in the air.\r\n\r\nTip ran up to it.\r\n\r\n\"You're a nice sort of a horse, I must say!\" he exclaimed. \"Why didn't you\r\nstop when I yelled 'whoa?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Does 'whoa' mean to stop?\" asked the Saw-Horse, in a surprised voice, as it\r\nrolled its eyes upward to look at the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it does,\" answered Tip.\r\n\r\n\"And a hole in the ground means to stop, also, doesn't it?\" continued the\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure; unless you step over it,\" said Tip.\r\n\r\n\"What a strange place this is,\" the creature exclaimed, as if amazed. \"What\r\nam I doing here, anyway?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n52               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n               \"DO KEEP THOSE LEGS STILL.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n53\r\n\r\n\"Why, I've brought you to life,\" answered the boy \"but it won't hurt you\r\nany, if you mind me and do as I tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will do as you tell me,\" replied the Saw-Horse, humbly. \"But what\r\nhappened to me, a moment ago? I don't seem to be just right, someway.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're upside down,\" explained Tip. \"But just keep those legs still a\r\nminute and I'll set you right side up again.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many sides have I?\" asked the creature, wonderingly.\r\n\r\n\"Several,\" said Tip, briefly. \"But do keep those legs still.\"\r\n\r\nThe Saw-Horse now became quiet, and held its legs rigid; so that Tip, after\r\nseveral efforts, was able to roll him over and set him upright.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I seem all right now,\" said the queer animal, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"One of your ears is broken,\" Tip announced, after a careful examination.\r\n\"I'll have to make a new one.\"\r\n\r\nThen he led the Saw-Horse back to where Jack was vainly struggling to regain\r\nhis feet, and after assisting the Pumpkinhead to stand upright Tip whittled\r\nout a new ear and fastened it to the horse's head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n54\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said he, addressing his steed, \"pay attention to what I'm going to\r\ntell you. 'Whoa!' means to stop; 'Get-Up!' means to walk forward; 'Trot!'\r\nmeans to go as fast as you can. Understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe I do,\" returned the horse.\r\n\r\n\"Very good. We are all going on a journey to the Emerald City, to see His\r\nMajesty, the Scarecrow; and Jack Pumpkinhead is going to ride on your back,\r\nso he won't wear out his joints.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind,\" said the Saw-Horse. \"Anything that suits you suits me.\"\r\n\r\nThen Tip assisted Jack to get upon the horse.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on tight,\" he cautioned, \"or you may fall off and crack your pumpkin\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be horrible!\" said Jack, with a shudder. \"What shall I hold on\r\nto?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, hold on to his ears,\" replied Tip, after a moment's hesitation.\r\n\r\n\"Don't do that!\" remonstrated the Saw-Horse; \"for then I can't hear.\"\r\n\r\nThat seemed reasonable, so Tip tried to think of something else.\r\n\r\n\"I'll fix it!\" said he, at length. He went into the wood and cut a short\r\nlength of limb from a young, stout tree. One end of this he sharpened to a\r\npoint, and then he dug a hole in the back of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n55               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n               \"DOES IT HURT?\" ASKED THE BOY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n56\r\nthe Saw-Horse, just behind its head. Next he brought a piece of rock from\r\nthe road and hammered the post firmly into the animal's back.\r\n\r\n\"Stop! Stop!\" shouted the horse; \"you're jarring me terribly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it hurt?\" asked the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly hurt,\" answered the animal; \"but it makes me quite nervous to\r\nbe jarred.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's all over now\" said Tip, encouragingly. \"Now, Jack, be sure to\r\nhold fast to this post and then you can't fall off and get smashed.\"\r\n\r\nSo Jack held on tight, and Tip said to the horse:\r\n\r\n\"Get up.\"\r\n\r\nThe obedient creature at once walked forward, rocking from side to side as\r\nhe raised his feet from the ground.\r\n\r\nTip walked beside the Saw-Horse, quite content with this addition to their\r\nparty. Presently he began to whistle.\r\n\r\n\"What does that sound mean?\" asked the horse.\r\n\r\n\"Don't pay any attention to it,\" said Tip. \"I'm just whistling, and that\r\nonly means I'm pretty well satisfied.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd whistle myself, if I could push my lips together,\" remarked Jack. \"I\r\nfear, dear father, that in some respects I am sadly lacking.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n57\r\n\r\nAfter journeying on for some distance the narrow path they were following\r\nturned into a broad roadway, paved with yellow brick. By the side of the\r\nroad Tip noticed a sign-post that read:\r\n\r\n             \"NINE MILES TO THE EMERALD CITY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it was now growing dark, so he decided to camp for the night by the\r\nroadside and to resume the journey next morning by daybreak. He led the Saw-\r\nHorse to a grassy mound upon which grew several bushy trees, and carefully\r\nassisted the Pumpkinhead to alight.\r\n\r\n\"I think I'll lay you upon the ground, overnight,\" said the boy. \"You will\r\nbe safer that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about me?\" asked the Saw-Horse.\r\n\r\n\"It won't hurt you to stand,\" replied Tip; \"and, as you can't sleep, you may\r\nas well watch out and see that no one comes near to disturb us.\"\r\n\r\nThen the boy stretched himself upon the grass beside the Pumpkinhead, and\r\nbeing greatly wearied by the journey was soon fast asleep.\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n58               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n59               Jack Pumpkinhead's Ride to the Emerald City\r\n\r\n\r\nAt daybreak Tip was awakened by the Pumpkinhead. He rubbed the sleep from\r\nhis eyes, bathed in a little brook, and then ate a portion of his bread and\r\ncheese. Having thus prepared for a new day the boy said:\r\n\r\n\"Let us start at once. Nine miles is quite a distance, but we ought to reach\r\nthe Emerald City by noon if no accidents happen.\" So the Pumpkinhead was\r\nagain perched upon the back of the Saw-Horse and the journey was resumed.\r\n\r\nTip noticed that the purple tint of the grass and trees had now faded to a\r\ndull lavender, and before long this lavender appeared to take on a greenish\r\ntinge that gradually brightened as they drew nearer to the great City where\r\nthe Scarecrow ruled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n60\r\n\r\nThe little party had traveled but a short two miles upon their way when the\r\nroad of yellow brick was parted by a broad and swift river. Tip was puzzled\r\nhow to cross over; but after a time he discovered a man in a ferry-boat\r\napproaching from the other side of the stream.\r\n\r\nWhen the man reached the bank Tip asked:\r\n\r\n\"Will you row us to the other side?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if you have money,\" returned the ferryman, whose face looked cross and\r\ndisagreeable.\r\n\r\n\"But I have no money,\" said Tip.\r\n\r\n\"None at all?\" inquired the man.\r\n\r\n\"None at all,\" answered the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll not break my back rowing you over,\" said the ferryman, decidedly.\r\n\r\n\"What a nice man!\" remarked the Pumpkinhead, smilingly.\r\n\r\nThe ferryman stared at him, but made no reply. Tip was trying to think, for\r\nit was a great disappointment to him to find his journey so suddenly brought\r\nto an end.\r\n\r\n\"I must certainly get to the Emerald City,\" he said to the boatman; \"but how\r\ncan I cross the river if you do not take me?\"\r\n\r\nThe man laughed, and it was not a nice laugh.\r\n\r\n\"That wooden horse will float,\" said he; \"and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n61               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\nyou can ride him across. As for the pumpkinheaded loon who accompanies you,\r\nlet him sink or swim it won't matter greatly which.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry about me,\" said Jack, smiling pleasantly upon the crabbed\r\nferryman; \"I'm sure I ought to float beautifully.\"\r\n\r\nTip thought the experiment was worth making, and the Saw-Horse, who did not\r\nknow what danger meant, offered no objections whatever. So the boy led it\r\ndown into the water and climbed upon its back. Jack also waded in up to his\r\nknees and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n62\r\ngrasped the tail of the horse so that he might keep his pumpkin head above\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Tip, instructing the Saw-Horse, \"if you wiggle your legs you\r\nwill probably swim; and if you swim we shall probably reach the other side.\"\r\n\r\nThe Saw-Horse at once began to wiggle its legs, which acted as oars and\r\nmoved the adventurers slowly across the river to the opposite side. So\r\nsuccessful was the trip that presently they were climbing, wet and dripping,\r\nup the grassy bank.\r\n\r\nTip's trouser-legs and shoes were thoroughly soaked; but the Saw-Horse had\r\nfloated so perfectly that from his knees up the boy was entirely dry. As for\r\nthe Pumpkinhead, every stitch of his gorgeous clothing dripped water.\r\n\r\n\"The sun will soon dry us,\" said Tip \"and, anyhow, we are now safely across,\r\nin spite of the ferryman, and can continue our journey.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't mind swimming, at all,\" remarked the horse.\r\n\r\n\"Nor did I,\" added Jack.\r\n\r\nThey soon regained the road of yellow brick, which proved to be a\r\ncontinuation of the road they had left on the other side, and then Tip once\r\nmore mounted the Pumpkinhead upon the back of the Saw-Horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n63\r\n\r\n\"If you ride fast,\" said he, \"the wind will help to dry your clothing. I\r\nwill hold on to the horse's tail and run after you. In this way we all will\r\nbecome dry in a very short time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the horse must step lively,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"I'll do my best,\" returned the Saw-Horse, cheerfully.\r\n\r\nTip grasped the end of the branch that served as tail to the Saw-Horse, and\r\ncalled loudly: \"Get-up!\"\r\n\r\nThe horse started at a good pace, and Tip followed behind. Then he decided\r\nthey could go faster, so he shouted: \"Trot!\"\r\n\r\nNow, the Saw-Horse remembered that this word was the command to go as fast\r\nas he could; so he began rocking along the road at a tremendous pace,\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n64\r\nand Tip had hard work--running faster than he ever had before in his\r\nlife--to keep his feet.\r\n\r\nSoon he was out of breath, and although he wanted to call \"Whoa!\" to the\r\nhorse, he found he could not get the word out of his throat. Then the end of\r\nthe tail he was clutching, being nothing more than a dead branch, suddenly\r\nbroke away, and the next minute the boy was rolling in the dust of the road,\r\nwhile the horse and its pumpkin-headed rider dashed on and quickly\r\ndisappeared in the distance.\r\n\r\nBy the time Tip had picked himself up and cleared the dust from his throat\r\nso he could say \"Whoa!\" there was no further need of saying it, for the\r\nhorse was long since out of sight.\r\n\r\nSo he did the only sensible thing he could do. He sat down and took a good\r\nrest, and afterward began walking along the road.\r\n\r\n\"Some time I will surely overtake them,\" he reflected; \"for the road will\r\nend at the gates of the Emerald City, and they can go no further than that.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime Jack was holding fast to the post and the Saw-Horse was tearing\r\nalong the road like a racer. Neither of them knew Tip was left behind, for\r\nthe Pumpkinhead did not look around and the Saw-Horse couldn't.\r\n\r\nAs he rode, Jack noticed that the grass and trees\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n65\r\nhad become a bright emerald-green in color, so he guessed they were nearing\r\nthe Emerald City even before the tall spires and domes came into sight.\r\n\r\nAt length a high wall of green stone, studded thick with emeralds, loomed up\r\nbefore them; and fearing the Saw-Horse would not know enough to stop and so\r\nmight smash them both against this wall, Jack ventured to cry \"Whoa!\" as\r\nloud as he could.\r\n\r\nSo suddenly did the horse obey that had it not been for his post Jack would\r\nhave been pitched off head foremost, and his beautiful face ruined.\r\n\r\n\"That was a fast ride, dear father!\" he exclaimed; and then, hearing no\r\nreply, he turned around and discovered for the first time that Tip was not\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThis apparent desertion puzzled the Pumpkinhead, and made him uneasy. And\r\nwhile he was wondering what had become of the boy, and what he ought to do\r\nnext under such trying circumstances, the gateway in the green wall opened\r\nand a man came out.\r\n\r\nThis man was short and round, with a fat face that seemed remarkably good-\r\nnatured. He was clothed all in green and wore a high, peaked green hat upon\r\nhis head and green spectacles over his eyes. Bowing before the Pumpkinhead\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n\"I am the Guardian of the Gates of the Emerald\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n66\r\nCity. May I inquire who you are, and what is your business?\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Jack Pumpkinhead,\" returned the other, smilingly; \"but as to my\r\nbusiness, I haven't the least idea in the world what it is.\"\r\n\r\nThe Guardian of the Gates looked surprised, and shook his head as if\r\ndissatisfied with the reply.\r\n\r\n\"What are you, a man or a pumpkin?\" he asked, politely.\r\n\r\n\"Both, if you please,\" answered Jack.\r\n\r\n\"And this wooden horse--is it alive?\" questioned the Guardian.\r\n\r\nThe horse rolled one knotty eye upward and winked at Jack. Then it gave a\r\nprance and brought one leg down on the Guardian's toes.\r\n\r\n\"Ouch!\" cried the man; \"I'm sorry I asked that question. But the answer is\r\nmost convincing. Have you any errand, sir, in the Emerald City?\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that I have,\" replied the Pumpkinhead, seriously; \"but I\r\ncannot think what it is. My father knows all about it, but he is not here.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a strange affair very strange!\" declared the Guardian. \"But you\r\nseem harmless. Folks do not smile so delightfully when they mean mischief.\"\r\n\r\n\"As for that,\" said Jack, \"I cannot help my smile, for it is carved on my\r\nface with a jack-knife.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n67\r\n\r\n\"Well, come with me into my room,\" resumed the Guardian, \"and I will see\r\nwhat can be done for you.\"\r\n\r\nSo Jack rode the Saw-Horse through the gateway into a little room built into\r\nthe wall. The Guardian pulled a bell-cord, and presently a very tall\r\nsoldier--clothed in a green uniform--entered from the opposite door. This\r\nsoldier carried a long green gun over his shoulder and had lovely green\r\nwhiskers that fell quite to his knees. The Guardian at once addressed him,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\"Here is a strange gentleman who doesn't know why he has come to the Emerald\r\nCity, or what he wants. Tell me, what shall we do with him?\"\r\n\r\nThe Soldier with the Green Whiskers looked at Jack with much care and\r\ncuriosity. Finally he shook his head so positively that little waves rippled\r\ndown his whiskers, and then he said:\r\n\r\n\"I must take him to His Majesty, the Scarecrow.\"\r\n\r\nBut what will His Majesty, the Scarecrow, do with him?\" asked the Guardian\r\nof the Gates.\r\n\r\n\"That is His Majesty's business,\" returned the soldier. \"I have troubles\r\nenough of my own. All outside troubles must be turned over to His Majesty.\r\nSo put the spectacles on this fellow, and I'll take him to the royal\r\npalace.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n68\r\n\r\nSo the Guardian opened a big box of spectacles and tried to fit a pair to\r\nJack's great round eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't a pair in stock that will really cover those eyes up,\" said the\r\nlittle man, with a sigh; \"and your head is so big that I shall be obliged to\r\ntie the spectacles on.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why need I wear spectacles?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"It's the fashion here,\" said the Soldier, \"and they will keep you from\r\nbeing blinded by the glitter and glare of the gorgeous Emerald City.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Jack. \"Tie them on, by all means. I don't wish to be\r\nblinded.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I!\" broke in the Saw-Horse; so a pair of green spectacles was quickly\r\nfastened over the bulging knots that served it for eyes.\r\n\r\nThen the Soldier with the Green Whiskers led them through the inner gate and\r\nthey at once found themselves in the main street of the magnificent Emerald\r\nCity.\r\n\r\nSparkling green gems ornamented the fronts of the beautiful houses and the\r\ntowers and turrets were all faced with emeralds. Even the green marble\r\npavement glittered with precious stones, and it was indeed a grand and\r\nmarvelous sight to one who beheld it for the first time.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Pumpkinhead and the Saw-Horse,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n69\r\nknowing nothing of wealth and beauty, paid little attention to the wonderful\r\nsights they saw through their green spectacles. They calmly followed after\r\nthe green soldier and scarcely noticed the crowds of green people who stared\r\nat them in surprise. When a green dog ran out and barked at them the Saw-\r\nHorse promptly kicked at it with its wooden leg and sent the little animal\r\nhowling into one of the houses; but nothing more serious than this happened\r\nto interrupt their progress to the royal palace.\r\n\r\nThe Pumpkinhead wanted to ride up the green marble steps and straight into\r\nthe Scarecrow's presence; but the soldier would not permit that. So Jack\r\ndismounted, with much difficulty, and a servant led the Saw-Horse around to\r\nthe rear while the Soldier with the Green Whiskers escorted the Pumpkinhead\r\ninto the palace, by the front entrance.\r\n\r\nThe stranger was left in a handsomely furnished waiting room while the\r\nsoldier went to announce him. It so happened that at this hour His Majesty\r\nwas at leisure and greatly bored for want of something to do, so he ordered\r\nhis visitor to be shown at once into his throne room.\r\n\r\nJack felt no fear or embarrassment at meeting the ruler of this magnificent\r\ncity, for he was entirely ignorant of all worldly customs. But when he en-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n70\r\ntered the room and saw for the first time His Majesty the Scarecrow seated\r\nupon his glittering throne, he stopped short in amazement.\r\n\r\n                    Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n71               His Majesty the Scarecrow\r\n\r\n\r\nI suppose every reader of this book knows what a scarecrow is; but Jack\r\nPumpkinhead, never having seen such a creation, was more surprised at\r\nmeeting the remarkable King of the Emerald City than by any other one\r\nexperience of his brief life.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty the Scarecrow was dressed in a suit of faded blue clothes, and\r\nhis head was merely a small sack stuffed with straw, upon which eyes, ears,\r\na nose and a mouth had been rudely painted to represent a face. The clothes\r\nwere also stuffed with straw, and that so unevenly or carelessly that his\r\nMajesty's legs and arms seemed more bumpy than was necessary. Upon his hands\r\nwere gloves with long fingers, and these were padded with cotton. Wisps of\r\nstraw stuck out from the monarch's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n72\r\ncoat and also from his neck and boot-tops. Upon his head he wore a heavy\r\ngolden crown set thick with sparkling jewels, and the weight of this crown\r\ncaused his brow to sag in wrinkles, giving a thoughtful expression to the\r\npainted face. Indeed, the crown alone betokened majesty; in all else the\r\nScarecrow King was but a simple scarecrow--flimsy, awkward, and\r\nunsubstantial.\r\n\r\nBut if the strange appearance of his Majesty the Scarecrow seemed startling\r\nto Jack, no less wonderful was the form of the Pumpkinhead to the Scarecrow.\r\nThe purple trousers and pink waistcoat and red shirt hung loosely over the\r\nwooden joints Tip had manufactured, and the carved face on the pumpkin\r\ngrinned perpetually, as if its wearer considered life the jolliest thing\r\nimaginable.\r\n\r\nAt first, indeed, His Majesty thought his queer visitor was laughing at him,\r\nand was inclined to resent such a liberty; but it was not without reason\r\nthat the Scarecrow had attained the reputation of being the wisest personage\r\nin the Land of Oz. He made a more careful examination of his visitor, and\r\nsoon discovered that Jack's features were carved into a smile and that he\r\ncould not look grave if he wished to.\r\n\r\nThe King was the first to speak. After regarding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n73               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\nJack for some minutes he said, in a tone of wonder:\r\n\r\n\"Where on earth did you come from, and how do you happen to be alive?\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your Majesty's pardon,\" returned the Pumpkinhead; \"but I do not\r\nunderstand you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n74\r\n\r\n\"What don't you understand?\" asked the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I don't understand your language. You see, I came from the Country of\r\nthe Gillikins, so that I am a foreigner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, to be sure!\" exclaimed the Scarecrow. \"I myself speak the language of\r\nthe Munchkins, which is also the language of the Emerald City. But you, I\r\nsuppose, speak the language of the Pumpkinheads?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly so, your Majesty\" replied the other, bowing; \"so it will be\r\nimpossible for us to understand one another.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is unfortunate, certainly,\" said the Scarecrow, thoughtfully. \"We must\r\nhave an interpreter.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is an interpreter?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"A person who understands both my language and your own. When I say\r\nanything, the interpreter can tell you what I mean; and when you say\r\nanything the interpreter can tell me what you mean. For the interpreter can\r\nspeak both languages as well as understand them.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is certainly clever,\" said Jack, greatly pleased at finding so simple\r\na way out of the difficulty.\r\n\r\nSo the Scarecrow commanded the Soldier with the Green Whiskers to search\r\namong his people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n75\r\nuntil he found one who understood the language of the Gillikins as well as\r\nthe language of the Emerald City, and to bring that person to him at once.\r\n\r\nWhen the Soldier had departed the Scarecrow said:\r\n\r\n\"Won't you take a chair while we are waiting?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty forgets that I cannot understand you,\" replied the\r\nPumpkinhead. \"If you wish me to sit down you must make a sign for me to do\r\nso.\" The Scarecrow came down from his throne and rolled an armchair to a\r\nposition behind the Pumpkinhead. Then he gave Jack a sudden push that sent\r\nhim sprawling upon the cushions in so awkward a fashion that he doubled up\r\nlike a jackknife, and had hard work to untangle himself.\r\n\r\n\"Did you understand that sign?\" asked His Majesty, politely.\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly,\" declared Jack, reaching up his arms to turn his head to the\r\nfront, the pumpkin having twisted around upon the stick that supported it.\r\n\r\n\"You seem hastily made,\" remarked the Scarecrow, watching Jack's efforts to\r\nstraighten himself.\r\n\r\n\"Not more so than your Majesty,\" was the frank reply.\r\n\r\n\"There is this difference between us,\" said the Scarecrow, \"that whereas I\r\nwill bend, but not break, you will break, but not bend.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n76               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n               \"HE GAVE JACK A SUDDEN PUSH\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n77\r\n\r\nAt this moment the soldier returned leading a young girl by the hand. She\r\nseemed very sweet and modest, having a pretty face and beautiful green eyes\r\nand hair. A dainty green silk skirt reached to her knees, showing silk\r\nstockings embroidered with pea-pods, and green satin slippers with bunches\r\nof lettuce for decorations instead of bows or buckles. Upon her silken waist\r\nclover leaves were embroidered, and she wore a jaunty little jacket trimmed\r\nwith sparkling emeralds of a uniform size.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's little Jellia Jamb!\" exclaimed the Scarecrow, as the green maiden\r\nbowed her pretty head before him. \"Do you understand the language of the\r\nGillikins, my dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your Majesty,\" she answered, \"for I was born in the North Country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you shall be our interpreter,\" said the Scarecrow, \"and explain to\r\nthis Pumpkinhead all that I say, and also explain to me all that he says. Is\r\nthis arrangement satisfactory?\" he asked, turning toward his guest.\r\n\r\n\"Very satisfactory indeed,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Then ask him, to begin with,\" resumed the Scarecrow, turning to Jellia,\r\n\"what brought him to the Emerald City.\"\r\n\r\nBut instead of this the girl, who had been staring at Jack, said to him:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n78\r\n\r\n\"You are certainly a wonderful creature. Who made you?\"\r\n\r\n\"A boy named Tip,\" answered Jack.\r\n\r\n\"What does he say?\" inquired the Scarecrow. \"My ears must have deceived me.\r\nWhat did he say?\"\r\n\r\n\"He says that your Majesty's brains seem to have come loose,\" replied the\r\ngirl, demurely.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow moved uneasily upon his throne, and felt of his head with his\r\nleft hand.\r\n\r\n\"What a fine thing it is to understand two different languages,\" he said,\r\nwith a perplexed sigh. \"Ask him, my dear, if he has any objection to being\r\nput in jail for insulting the ruler of the Emerald City.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't insult you!\" protested Jack, indignantly.\r\n\r\n\"Tut--tut!\" cautioned the Scarecrow \"wait, until Jellia translates my\r\nspeech. What have we got an interpreter for, if you break out in this rash\r\nway?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, I'll wait,\" replied the Pumpkinhead, in a surly tone--although\r\nhis face smiled as genially as ever. \"Translate the speech, young woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty inquires if you are hungry, said Jellia.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, not at all!\" answered Jack, more pleasantly, \"for it is impossible for\r\nme to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the same way with me,\" remarked the Scarecrow. \"What did he say,\r\nJellia, my dear?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n79\r\n\r\n\"He asked if you were aware that one of your eyes is painted larger than the\r\nother,\" said the girl, mischievously.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you believe her, your Majesty, cried Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't,\" answered the Scarecrow, calmly. Then, casting a sharp look at\r\nthe girl, he asked:\r\n\r\n\"Are you quite certain you understand the languages of both the Gillikins\r\nand the Munchkins?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite certain, your Majesty,\" said Jellia Jamb, trying hard not to laugh in\r\nthe face of royalty.\r\n\r\n\"Then how is it that I seem to understand them myself?\" inquired the\r\nScarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"Because they are one and the same!\" declared the girl, now laughing\r\nmerrily. \"Does not your Majesty know that in all the land of Oz but one\r\nlanguage is spoken?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it indeed so?\" cried the Scarecrow, much relieved to hear this; \"then I\r\nmight easily have been my own interpreter!\"\r\n\r\n\"It was all my fault, your Majesty,\" said Jack, looking rather foolish, \"I\r\nthought we must surely speak different languages, since we came from\r\ndifferent countries.\"\r\n\r\n\"This should be a warning to you never to think,\" returned the Scarecrow,\r\nseverely. \"For\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n80\r\nunless one can think wisely it is better to remain a dummy--which you most\r\ncertainly are.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am!--I surely am!\" agreed the Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" continued the Scarecrow, more mildly, \"that your\r\nmanufacturer spoiled some good pies to create an indifferent man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I assure your Majesty that I did not ask to be created,\" answered Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! It was the same in my case,\" said the King, pleasantly. \"And so, as we\r\ndiffer from all ordinary people, let us become friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"With all my heart!\" exclaimed Jack.\r\n\r\n\"What! Have you a heart?\" asked the Scarecrow, surprised.\r\n\r\n\"No; that was only imaginative--I might say, a figure of speech,\" said the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\"Well, your most prominent figure seems to be a figure of wood; so I must\r\nbeg you to restrain an imagination which, having no brains, you have no\r\nright to exercise,\" suggested the Scarecrow, warningly.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure!\" said Jack, without in the least comprehending.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty then dismissed Jellia Jamb and the Soldier with the Green\r\nWhiskers, and when they were gone he took his new friend by the arm and led\r\nhim into the courtyard to play a game of quoits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n81               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n82               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n83               Gen. Jinjur's Army of Revolt\r\n\r\n\r\nTip was so anxious to rejoin his man Jack and the Saw-Horse that he walked a\r\nfull half the distance to the Emerald City without stopping to rest. Then he\r\ndiscovered that he was hungry and the crackers and cheese he had provided\r\nfor the Journey had all been eaten.\r\n\r\nWhile wondering what he should do in this emergency he came upon a girl\r\nsitting by the roadside. She wore a costume that struck the boy as being\r\nremarkably brilliant: her silken waist being of emerald green and her skirt\r\nof four distinct colors--blue in front, yellow at the left side, red at\r\nthe back and purple at the right side. Fastening\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n84\r\nthe waist in front were four buttons--the top one blue, the next yellow, a\r\nthird red and the last purple.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe splendor of this dress was almost barbaric; so Tip was fully justified\r\nin staring at the gown for some moments before his eyes were attracted by\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n85\r\npretty face above it. Yes, the face was pretty enough, he decided; but it\r\nwore an expression of discontent coupled to a shade of defiance or audacity.\r\n\r\nWhile the boy stared the girl looked upon him calmly. A lunch basket stood\r\nbeside her, and she held a dainty sandwich in one hand and a hard-boiled egg\r\nin the other, eating with an evident appetite that aroused Tip's sympathy.\r\n\r\nHe was just about to ask a share of the luncheon when the girl stood up and\r\nbrushed the crumbs from her lap.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" said she; \"it is time for me to go. Carry that basket for me and\r\nhelp yourself to its contents if you are hungry.\"\r\n\r\nTip seized the basket eagerly and began to eat, following for a time the\r\nstrange girl without bothering to ask questions. She walked along before him\r\nwith swift strides, and there was about her an air of decision and\r\nimportance that led him to suspect she was some great personage.\r\n\r\nFinally, when he had satisfied his hunger, he ran up beside her and tried to\r\nkeep pace with her swift footsteps--a very difficult feat, for she was\r\nmuch taller than he, and evidently in a hurry.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you very much for the sandwiches,\" said Tip, as he trotted along.\r\n\"May I ask your name?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n86\r\n\r\n\"I am General Jinjur,\" was the brief reply.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said the boy surprised. \"What sort of a General?\"\r\n\r\n\"I command the Army of Revolt in this war,\" answered the General, with\r\nunnecessary sharpness.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" he again exclaimed. \"I didn't know there was a war.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were not supposed to know it,\" she returned, \"for we have kept it a\r\nsecret; and considering that our army is composed entirely of girls,\" she\r\nadded, with some pride, \"it is surely a remarkable thing that our Revolt is\r\nnot yet discovered.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, indeed,\" acknowledged Tip. \"But where is your army?\"\r\n\r\n\"About a mile from here,\" said General Jinjur. \"The forces have assembled\r\nfrom all parts of the Land of Oz, at my express command. For this is the day\r\nwe are to conquer His Majesty the Scarecrow, and wrest from him the throne.\r\nThe Army of Revolt only awaits my coming to march upon the Emerald City.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" declared Tip, drawing a long breath, \"this is certainly a surprising\r\nthing! May I ask why you wish to conquer His Majesty the Scarecrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the Emerald City has been ruled by men long enough, for one\r\nreason,\" said the girl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n87\r\n\"Moreover, the City glitters with beautiful gems, which might far better be\r\nused for rings, bracelets and necklaces; and there is enough money in the\r\nKing's treasury to buy every girl in our Army a dozen new gowns. So we\r\nintend to conquer the City and run the government to suit ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nJinjur spoke these words with an eagerness and decision that proved she was\r\nin earnest.\r\n\r\n\"But war is a terrible thing,\" said Tip, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"This war will be pleasant,\" replied the girl, cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"Many of you will be slain!\" continued the boy, in an awed voice.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no\", said Jinjur. \"What man would oppose a girl, or dare to harm her?\r\nAnd there is not an ugly face in my entire Army.\"\r\n\r\nTip laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you are right,\" said he. \"But the Guardian of the Gate is\r\nconsidered a faithful Guardian, and the King's Army will not let the City be\r\nconquered without a struggle.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Army is old and feeble,\" replied General Jinjur, scornfully. \"His\r\nstrength has all been used to grow whiskers, and his wife has such a temper\r\nthat she has already pulled more than half of them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n88\r\nout by the roots. When the Wonderful Wizard reigned the Soldier with the\r\nGreen Whiskers was a very good Royal Army, for people feared the Wizard. But\r\nno one is afraid of the Scarecrow, so his Royal Army don't count for much in\r\ntime of war.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this conversation they proceeded some distance in silence, and before\r\nlong reached a large clearing in the forest where fully four hundred young\r\nwomen were assembled. These were laughing and talking together as gaily as\r\nif they had gathered for a picnic instead of a war of conquest.\r\n\r\nThey were divided into four companies, and Tip noticed that all were dressed\r\nin costumes similar to that worn by General Jinjur. The only real difference\r\nwas that while those girls from the Munchkin country had the blue strip in\r\nfront of their skirts, those from the country of the Quadlings had the red\r\nstrip in front; and those from the country of the Winkies had the yellow\r\nstrip in front, and the Gillikin girls wore the purple strip in front. All\r\nhad green waists, representing the Emerald City they intended to conquer,\r\nand the top button on each waist indicated by its color which country the\r\nwearer came from. The uniforms were Jaunty and becoming, and quite effective\r\nwhen massed together.\r\n\r\nTip thought this strange Army bore no weapons\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n89\r\nwhatever; but in this he was wrong. For each girl had stuck through the knot\r\nof her back hair two long, glittering knitting-needles.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jinjur immediately mounted the stump of a tree and addressed her\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n\"Friends, fellow-citizens, and girls!\" she said; \"we are about to begin our\r\ngreat Revolt against the men of Oz! We march to conquer the Emerald City--to\r\ndethrone the Scarecrow King--to acquire thousands of gorgeous gems--to\r\nrifle the royal treasury--and to obtain power over our former\r\noppressors!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" said those who had listened; but Tip thought most of the Army was\r\ntoo much engaged in chattering to pay attention to the words of the General.\r\n\r\nThe command to march was now given, and the girls formed themselves into\r\nfour bands, or companies, and set off with eager strides toward the Emerald\r\nCity.\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing on the right of this page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n90               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boy followed after them, carrying several baskets and wraps and packages\r\nwhich various members of the Army of Revolt had placed in his care. It was\r\nnot long before they came to the green granite walls of the City and halted\r\nbefore the gateway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n91\r\n\r\nThe Guardian of the Gate at once came out and looked at them curiously, as\r\nif a circus had come to town. He carried a bunch of keys swung round his\r\nneck by a golden chain; his hands were thrust carelessly into his pockets,\r\nand he seemed to have no idea at all that the City was threatened by rebels.\r\nSpeaking pleasantly to the girls, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, my dears! What can I do for you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Surrender instantly!\" answered General Jinjur, standing before him and\r\nfrowning as terribly as her pretty face would allow her to.\r\n\r\n\"Surrender!\" echoed the man, astounded. \"Why, it's impossible. It's against\r\nthe law! I never heard of such a thing in my life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n92\r\n\r\n\"Still, you must surrender!\" exclaimed the General, fiercely. \"We are\r\nrevolting!\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't look it,\" said the Guardian, gazing from one to another,\r\nadmiringly.\r\n\r\n\"But we are!\" cried Jinjur, stamping her foot, impatiently; \"and we mean to\r\nconquer the Emerald City!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good gracious!\" returned the surprised Guardian of the Gates; \"what a\r\nnonsensical idea! Go home to your mothers, my good girls, and milk the cows\r\nand bake the bread. Don't you know it's a dangerous thing to conquer a\r\ncity?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are not afraid!\" responded the General; and she looked so determined\r\nthat it made the Guardian uneasy.\r\n\r\nSo he rang the bell for the Soldier with the Green Whiskers, and the next\r\nminute was sorry he had done so. For immediately he was surrounded by a\r\ncrowd of girls who drew the knitting-needles from their hair and began\r\nJabbing them at the Guardian with the sharp points dangerously near his fat\r\ncheeks and blinking eyes.\r\n\r\nThe poor man howled loudly for mercy and made no resistance when Jinjur drew\r\nthe bunch of keys from around his neck.\r\n\r\nFollowed by her Army the General now rushed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n93               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n               GENERAL JINJUR AND HER ARMY CAPTURE THE CITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n94\r\nto the gateway, where she was confronted by the Royal Army of Oz--which\r\nwas the other name for the Soldier with the Green Whiskers.\r\n\r\n\"Halt!\" he cried, and pointed his long gun full in the face of the leader.\r\n\r\nSome of the girls screamed and ran back, but General Jinjur bravely stood\r\nher ground and said, reproachfully:\r\n\r\n\"Why, how now? Would you shoot a poor, defenceless girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the soldier, \"for my gun isn't loaded.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not loaded?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; for fear of accidents. And I've forgotten where I hid the powder and\r\nshot to load it with. But if you'll wait a short time I'll try to hunt them\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't trouble yourself,\" said Jinjur, cheerfully. Then she turned to her\r\nArmy and cried:\r\n\r\n\"Girls, the gun isn't loaded!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hooray,\" shrieked the rebels, delighted at this good news, and they\r\nproceeded to rush upon the Soldier with the Green Whiskers in such a crowd\r\nthat it was a wonder they didn't stick the knitting-needles into one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nBut the Royal Army of Oz was too much afraid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n95\r\nof women to meet the onslaught. He simply turned about and ran with all his\r\nmight through the gate and toward the royal palace, while General Jinjur and\r\nher mob flocked into the unprotected City.\r\n\r\nIn this way was the Emerald City captured without a drop of blood being\r\nspilled. The Army of Revolt had become an Army of Conquerors!\r\n\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n96               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n97               The Scarecrow Plans an escape\r\n\r\n\r\nTip slipped away from the girls and followed swiftly after the Soldier with\r\nthe Green Whiskers. The invading army entered the City more slowly, for they\r\nstopped to dig emeralds out of the walls and paving-stones with the points\r\nof their knitting-needles. So the Soldier and the boy reached the palace\r\nbefore the news had spread that the City was conquered.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow and Jack Pumpkinhead were still playing at quoits in the\r\ncourtyard when the game was interrupted by the abrupt entrance of the Royal\r\nArmy of Oz, who came flying in without his hat or gun, his clothes in sad\r\ndisarray and his long beard floating a yard behind him as he ran.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n98\r\n\r\n\"Tally one for me,\" said the Scarecrow, calmly \"What's wrong, my man?\" he\r\nadded, addressing the Soldier.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! your Majesty--your Majesty! The City is conquered!\" gasped the Royal\r\nArmy, who was all out of breath.\r\n\r\n\"This is quite sudden,\" said the Scarecrow. \"But please go and bar all the\r\ndoors and windows of the palace, while I show this Pumpkinhead how to throw\r\na quoit.\"\r\n\r\nThe Soldier hastened to do this, while Tip, who had arrived at his heels,\r\nremained in the courtyard to look at the Scarecrow with wondering eyes.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty continued to throw the quoits as coolly as if no danger\r\nthreatened his throne, but the Pumpkinhead, having caught sight of Tip,\r\nambled toward the boy as fast as his wooden legs would go.\r\n\r\n\"Good afternoon, noble parent!\" he cried, delightedly. \"I'm glad to see you\r\nare here. That terrible Saw-Horse ran away with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suspected it,\" said Tip. \"Did you get hurt? Are you cracked at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I arrived safely,\" answered Jack, \"and his Majesty has been very kind\r\nindeed to me.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the Soldier with the Green Whiskers returned, and the\r\nScarecrow asked:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n99\r\n\r\n\"By the way, who has conquered me?\"\r\n\r\n\"A regiment of girls, gathered from the four corners of the Land of Oz,\"\r\nreplied the Soldier, still pale with fear.\r\n\r\n\"But where was my Standing Army at the time?\" inquired his Majesty, looking\r\nat the Soldier, gravely.\r\n\r\n\"Your Standing Army was running,\" answered the fellow, honestly; \"for no man\r\ncould face the terrible weapons of the invaders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the Scarecrow, after a moment's thought, \"I don't mind much the\r\nloss of my throne, for it's a tiresome job to rule over the Emerald City.\r\nAnd this crown is so heavy that it makes my head ache. But I hope the\r\nConquerors have no intention of injuring me, just because I happen to be the\r\nKing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard them, say\" remarked Tip, with some hesitation, \"that they intend to\r\nmake a rag carpet of your outside and stuff their sofa-cushions with your\r\ninside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I am really in danger,\" declared his Majesty, positively, \"and it will\r\nbe wise for me to consider a means to escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where can you go?\" asked Jack Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n\"Why, to my friend the Tin Woodman, who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n100               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\nrules over the Winkies, and calls himself their Emperor,\" was the answer. \"I\r\nam sure he will protect me.\"\r\n\r\nTip was looking out the window.\r\n\r\n\"The palace is surrounded by the enemy,\" said\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n101\r\nhe \"It is too late to escape. They would soon tear you to pieces.\"\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow sighed.\r\n\r\n\"In an emergency,\" he announced, \"it is always a good thing to pause and\r\nreflect. Please excuse me while I pause and reflect.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we also are in danger,\" said the Pumpkinhead, anxiously. \"If any of\r\nthese girls understand cooking, my end is not far off!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" exclaimed the Scarecrow. \"they're too busy to cook, even if they\r\nknow how!\"\r\n\r\n\"But should I remain here a prisoner for any length of time,\" protested\r\nJack,\" I'm liable to spoil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! then you would not be fit to associate with,\" returned the Scarecrow.\r\n\"The matter is more serious than I suspected.\"\r\n\r\n\"You,\" said the Pumpkinhead, gloomily, \"are liable to live for many years.\r\nMy life is necessarily short. So I must take advantage of the few days that\r\nremain to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"There, there! Don't worry,\" answered the Scarecrow soothingly; \"if you'll\r\nkeep quiet long enough for me to think, I'll try to find some way for us all\r\nto escape.\"\r\n\r\nSo the others waited in patient silence while the Scarecrow walked to a\r\ncorner and stood with his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n102\r\nface to the wall for a good five minutes. At the end of that time he faced\r\nthem with a more cheerful expression upon his painted face.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the Saw-Horse you rode here?\" he asked the Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I said he was a jewel, and so your man locked him up in the royal\r\ntreasury,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"It was the only place I could think of your Majesty,\" added the Soldier,\r\nfearing he had made a blunder.\r\n\r\n\"It pleases me very much,\" said the Scarecrow. \"Has the animal been fed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; I gave him a heaping peck of sawdust.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent!\" cried the Scarecrow. \"Bring the horse here at once.\"\r\n\r\nThe Soldier hastened away, and presently they heard the clattering of the\r\nhorse's wooden legs upon the pavement as he was led into the courtyard.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty regarded the steed critically. \"He doesn't seem especially\r\ngraceful!\" he remarked, musingly. \"but I suppose he can run?\"\r\n\r\n\"He can, indeed,\" said Tip, gazing upon the Saw-Horse admiringly.\r\n\r\n\"Then, bearing us upon his back, he must make a dash through the ranks of\r\nthe rebels and carry us to my friend the Tin Woodman,\" announced the\r\nScarecrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n103\r\n\r\n\"He can't carry four!\" objected Tip.\r\n\r\n\"No, but he may be induced to carry three,\" said his Majesty. \"I shall\r\ntherefore leave my Royal Army Behind. For, from the ease with which he was\r\nconquered, I have little confidence in his powers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, he can run,\" declared Tip, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"I expected this blow\" said the Soldier, sulkily; \"but I can bear it. I\r\nshall disguise myself by cutting off my lovely green whiskers. And, after\r\nall, it is no more dangerous to face those reckless girls than to ride this\r\nfiery, untamed wooden horse!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you are right,\" observed his Majesty. \"But, for my part, not being\r\na soldier, I am fond of danger. Now, my boy, you must mount first. And\r\nplease sit as close to the horse's neck as possible.\"\r\n\r\nTip climbed quickly to his place, and the Soldier and the Scarecrow managed\r\nto hoist the Pumpkinhead to a seat just behind him. There remained so little\r\nspace for the King that he was liable to fall off as soon as the horse\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\n\"Fetch a clothesline,\" said the King to his Army, \"and tie us all together.\r\nThen if one falls off we will all fall off.\"\r\n\r\nAnd while the Soldier was gone for the clothesline his Majesty continued,\r\n\"it is well for me to be careful, for my very existence is in danger.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n104\r\n\r\n\"I have to be as careful as you do,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"for if anything happened to me, that\r\nwould be the end of me. But if anything happened to you, they could use you\r\nfor seed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Soldier now returned with a long line and tied all three firmly\r\ntogether, also lashing them to the body of the Saw-Horse; so there seemed\r\nlittle danger of their tumbling off.\r\n\r\n\"Now throw open the gates,\" commanded the Scarecrow, \"and we will make a\r\ndash to liberty or to death.\"\r\n\r\nThe courtyard in which they were standing was located in the center of the\r\ngreat palace, which surrounded it on all sides. But in one place a passage\r\nled to an outer gateway, which the Soldier had barred by order of his\r\nsovereign. It was through this gateway his Majesty proposed to escape, and\r\nthe Royal Army now led the Saw-Horse along the passage and unbarred the\r\ngate, which swung backward with a loud crash.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Tip to the horse, \"you must save us all. Run as fast as you can\r\nfor the gate of the City, and don't let anything stop you.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right!\" answered the Saw-Horse, gruffly, and dashed away so suddenly\r\nthat Tip had to gasp\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n105               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n               \"WE WILL MAKE A DASH TO LIBERTY OR TO DEATH.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n106\r\nfor breath and hold firmly to the post he had driven into the creature's\r\nneck.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the girls, who stood outside guarding the palace, were knocked\r\nover by the Saw-Horse's mad rush. Others ran screaming out of the way, and\r\nonly one or two jabbed their knitting-needles frantically at the escaping\r\nprisoners. Tip got one small prick in his left arm, which smarted for an\r\nhour afterward; but the needles had no effect upon the Scarecrow or Jack\r\nPumpkinhead, who never even suspected they were being prodded.\r\n\r\nAs for the Saw-Horse, he made a wonderful record upsetting a fruit cart,\r\noverturning several meek looking men, and finally bowling over the new\r\nGuardian of the Gate--a fussy little fat woman appointed by General\r\nJinjur.\r\n\r\nNor did the impetuous charger stop then. Once outside the walls of the\r\nEmerald City he dashed along the road to the West with fast and violent\r\nleaps that shook the breath out of the boy and filled the Scarecrow with\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\nJack had ridden at this mad rate once before, so he devoted every effort to\r\nholding, with both hands, his pumpkin head upon its stick, enduring meantime\r\nthe dreadful jolting with the courage of a philosopher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n107               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n               THE WOODEN STEED GAVE ONE FINAL LEAP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n108\r\n\r\n\"Slow him up! Slow him up!\" shouted the Scarecrow. \"My straw is all shaking\r\ndown into my legs.\"\r\n\r\nBut Tip had no breath to speak, so the Saw-Horse continued his wild career\r\nunchecked and with unabated speed.\r\n\r\nPresently they came to the banks of a wide river, and without a pause the\r\nwooden steed gave one final leap and launched them all in mid-air.\r\n\r\nA second later they were rolling, splashing and bobbing about in the water,\r\nthe horse struggling frantically to find a rest for its feet and its riders\r\nbeing first plunged beneath the rapid current and then floating upon the\r\nsurface like corks.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n109               The Journey to the Tin Woodman\r\n\r\n\r\nTip was well soaked and dripping water from every angle of his body. But he\r\nmanaged to lean forward and shout in the ear of the Saw-Horse:\r\n\r\n\"Keep still, you fool! Keep still!\"\r\n\r\nThe horse at once ceased struggling and floated calmly upon the surface, its\r\nwooden body being as buoyant as a raft.\r\n\r\n\"What does that word 'fool' mean?\" enquired the horse.\r\n\r\n\"It is a term of reproach,\" answered Tip, somewhat ashamed of the\r\nexpression. \"I only use it when I am angry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it pleases me to be able to call you a fool, in return,\" said the\r\nhorse. \"For I did not make\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n110\r\nthe river, nor put it in our way; so only a term of, reproach is fit for one\r\nwho becomes angry with me for falling into the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is quite evident,\" replied Tip; \"so I will acknowledge myself in the\r\nwrong.\" Then he called out to the Pumpkinhead: \"are you all right, Jack?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no reply. So the boy called to the King \"are you all right, your\r\nmajesty?\"\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow groaned.\r\n\r\n\"I'm all wrong, somehow,\" he said, in a weak voice. \"How very wet this water\r\nis!\"\r\n\r\nTip was bound so tightly by the cord that he could not turn his head to look\r\nat his companions; so he said to the Saw-Horse:\r\n\r\n\"Paddle with your legs toward the shore.\"\r\n\r\nThe horse obeyed, and although their progress was slow they finally reached\r\nthe opposite river bank at a place where it was low enough to enable the\r\ncreature to scramble upon dry land.\r\n\r\nWith some difficulty the boy managed to get his knife out of his pocket and\r\ncut the cords that bound the riders to one another and to the wooden horse.\r\nHe heard the Scarecrow fall to the ground with a mushy sound, and then he\r\nhimself quickly dismounted and looked at his friend Jack.\r\n\r\nThe wooden body, with its gorgeous clothing,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n111\r\nstill sat upright upon the horse's back; but the pumpkin head was gone, and\r\nonly the sharpened stick that served for a neck was visible. As for the\r\nScarecrow, the straw in his body had shaken down with the jolting and packed\r\nitself into his legs and the lower part of his body--which appeared very\r\nplump and round while his upper half seemed like an empty sack. Upon his\r\nhead the Scarecrow still wore the heavy crown, which had been sewed on to\r\nprevent his losing it; but the head was now so damp and limp that the weight\r\nof the gold and jewels sagged forward and crushed the painted face into a\r\nmass of wrinkles that made him look exactly like a Japanese pug dog.\r\n\r\nTip would have laughed--had he not been so anxious about his man Jack. But\r\nthe Scarecrow, however damaged, was all there, while the pumpkin head that\r\nwas so necessary to Jack's existence was missing; so the boy seized a long\r\npole that fortunately lay near at hand and anxiously turned again toward the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nFar out upon the waters he sighted the golden hue of the pumpkin, which\r\ngently bobbed up and down with the motion of the waves. At that moment it\r\nwas quite out of Tip's reach, but after a time it floated nearer and still\r\nnearer until the boy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n112               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n               TIP RESCUES JACK'S PUMPKIN HEAD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n113\r\nwas able to reach it with his pole and draw it to the shore. Then he brought\r\nit to the top of the bank, carefully wiped the water from its pumpkin face\r\nwith his handkerchief, and ran with it to Jack and replaced the head upon\r\nthe man's neck.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" were Jack's first words. \"What a dreadful experience! I wonder if\r\nwater is liable to spoil pumpkins?\"\r\n\r\nTip did not think a reply was necessary, for he knew that the Scarecrow also\r\nstood in need of his help. So he carefully removed the straw from the King's\r\nbody and legs, and spread it out in the sun to dry. The wet clothing he hung\r\nover the body of the Saw-Horse.\r\n\r\n\"If water spoils pumpkins,\" observed Jack, with a deep sigh, \"then my days\r\nare numbered.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've never noticed that water spoils pumpkins,\" returned Tip; \"unless the\r\nwater happens to be boiling. If your head isn't cracked, my friend, you must\r\nbe in fairly good condition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my head isn't cracked in the least,\" declared Jack, more cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"Then don't worry,\" retorted the boy. \"Care once killed a cat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Jack, seriously, \"I am very glad indeed that I am not a cat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n114\r\n\r\nThe sun was fast drying their clothing, and Tip stirred up his Majesty's\r\nstraw so that the warm rays might absorb the moisture and make it as crisp\r\nand dry as ever. When this had been accomplished he stuffed the Scarecrow\r\ninto symmetrical shape and smoothed out his face so that he wore his usual\r\ngay and charming expression.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you very much,\" said the monarch, brightly, as he walked about and\r\nfound himself to be well balanced. \"There are several distinct advantages in\r\nbeing a Scarecrow. For if one has friends near at hand to repair damages,\r\nnothing very serious can happen to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if hot sunshine is liable to crack pumpkins,\" said Jack, with an\r\nanxious ring in his voice.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all--not at all!\" replied the Scarecrow, gaily.\" All you need\r\nfear, my boy, is old age. When your golden youth has decayed we shall\r\nquickly part company--but you needn't look forward to it; we'll discover\r\nthe fact ourselves, and notify you. But come! Let us resume our journey. I\r\nam anxious to greet my friend the Tin Woodman.\"\r\n\r\nSo they remounted the Saw-Horse, Tip holding to the post, the Pumpkinhead\r\nclinging to Tip, and the Scarecrow with both arms around the wooden form of\r\nJack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n115               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n               TIP STUFFS THE SCARECROW WITH DRY STRAW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n116\r\n\r\n\"Go slowly, for now there is no danger of pursuit,\" said Tip to his steed.\r\n\r\n\"All right!\" responded the creature, in a voice rather gruff.\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you a little hoarse?\" asked the Pumpkinhead politely.\r\n\r\nThe Saw-Horse gave an angry prance and rolled one knotty eye backward toward\r\nTip.\r\n\r\n\"See here,\" he growled, \"can't you protect me from insult?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure!\" answered Tip, soothingly. \"I am sure Jack meant no harm. And\r\nit will not do for us to quarrel, you know; we must all remain good\r\nfriends.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll have nothing more to do with that Pumpkinhead,\" declared the Saw-\r\nHorse, viciously. \"he loses his head too easily to suit me.\"\r\n\r\nThere seemed no fitting reply to this speech, so for a time they rode along\r\nin silence.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the Scarecrow remarked:\r\n\r\n\"This reminds me of old times. It was upon this grassy knoll that I once\r\nsaved Dorothy from the Stinging Bees of the Wicked Witch of the West.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do Stinging Bees injure pumpkins?\" asked Jack, glancing around fearfully.\r\n\r\n\"They are all dead, so it doesn't matter,\" replied\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n117\r\nthe Scarecrow.\" And here is where Nick Chopper destroyed the Wicked Witch's\r\nGrey Wolves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was Nick Chopper?\" asked Tip.\r\n\r\n\"That is the name of my friend the Tin Woodman, answered his Majesty. And\r\nhere is where the Winged Monkeys captured and bound us, and flew away with\r\nlittle Dorothy,\" he continued, after they had traveled a little way farther.\r\n\r\n\"Do Winged Monkeys ever eat pumpkins?\" asked Jack, with a shiver of fear.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know; but you have little cause to, worry, for the Winged Monkeys\r\nare now the slaves of Glinda the Good, who owns the Golden Cap that commands\r\ntheir services,\" said the Scarecrow, reflectively.\r\n\r\nThen the stuffed monarch became lost in thought recalling the days of past\r\nadventures. And the Saw-Horse rocked and rolled over the flower-strewn\r\nfields and carried its riders swiftly upon their way.\r\n\r\n               * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nTwilight fell, bye and bye, and then the dark shadows of night. So Tip\r\nstopped the horse and they all proceeded to dismount.\r\n\r\n\"I'm tired out,\" said the boy, yawning wearily; \"and the grass is soft and\r\ncool. Let us lie down here and sleep until morning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n118\r\n\r\n\"I can't sleep,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"I never do,\" said the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"I do not even know what sleep is,\" said the Saw-Horse.\r\n\r\n\"Still, we must have consideration for this poor boy, who is made of flesh\r\nand blood and bone, and gets tired,\" suggested the Scarecrow, in his usual\r\nthoughtful manner. \"I remember it was the same way with little Dorothy. We\r\nalways had to sit through the night while she slept.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Tip, meekly, \"but I can't help it. And I'm dreadfully\r\nhungry, too!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is a new danger!\" remarked Jack, gloomily. \"I hope you are not fond of\r\neating pumpkins.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not unless they're stewed and made into pies,\" answered the boy, laughing.\r\n\"So have no fears of me, friend Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a coward that Pumpkinhead is!\" said the Saw-Horse, scornfully.\r\n\r\n\"You might be a coward yourself, if you knew you were liable to spoil!\"\r\nretorted Jack, angrily.\r\n\r\n\"There!--there!\" interrupted the Scarecrow; \"don't let us quarrel. We all\r\nhave our weaknesses, dear friends; so we must strive to be considerate of\r\none another. And since this poor boy is hungry and has nothing whatever to\r\neat, let us all remain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n119\r\nquiet and allow him to sleep; for it is said that in sleep a mortal may\r\nforget even hunger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you!\" exclaimed Tip, gratefully. \"Your Majesty is fully as good as\r\nyou are wise--and that is saying a good deal!\"\r\n\r\nHe then stretched himself upon the grass and, using the stuffed form of the\r\nScarecrow for a pillow, was presently fast asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n120               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n121               A Nickel-Plated Emperor\r\n\r\n\r\nTip awoke soon after dawn, but the Scarecrow had already risen and plucked,\r\nwith his clumsy fingers, a double-handful of ripe berries from some bushes\r\nnear by. These the boy ate greedily, finding them an ample breakfast, and\r\nafterward the little party resumed its Journey.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour's ride they reached the summit of a hill from whence they\r\nespied the City of the Winkies and noted the tall domes of the Emperor's\r\npalace rising from the clusters of more modest dwellings.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow became greatly animated at this sight, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"How delighted I shall be to see my old friend the Tin Woodman again! I hope\r\nthat he rules his people more successfully than I have ruled mine!\"\r\n\r\nIs the Tin Woodman the Emperor of the Winkies?\" asked the horse.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed. They invited him to rule over\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n122\r\nthem soon after the Wicked Witch was destroyed; and as Nick Chopper has the\r\nbest heart in all the world I am sure he has proved an excellent and able\r\nemperor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought that 'Emperor' was the title of a person who rules an empire,\"\r\nsaid Tip, \"and the Country of the Winkies is only a Kingdom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't mention that to the Tin Woodman!\" exclaimed the Scarecrow, earnestly.\r\n\"You would hurt his feelings terribly. He is a proud man, as he has every\r\nreason to be, and it pleases him to be termed Emperor rather than King.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure it makes no difference to me,\" replied the boy.\r\n\r\nThe Saw-Horse now ambled forward at a pace so fast that its riders had hard\r\nwork to stick upon its back; so there was little further conversation until\r\nthey drew up beside the palace steps.\r\n\r\nAn aged Winkie, dressed in a uniform of silver cloth, came forward to assist\r\nthem to alight. Said the Scarecrow to his personage:\r\n\r\n\"Show us at once to your master, the Emperor.\"\r\n\r\nThe man looked from one to another of the party in an embarrassed way, and\r\nfinally answered:\r\n\r\n\"I fear I must ask you to wait for a time. The Emperor is not receiving this\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n123\r\n\r\n\"How is that?\" enquired the Scarecrow, anxiously.\" I hope nothing has\r\nhappened to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; nothing serious,\" returned the man. \"But this is his Majesty's day\r\nfor being polished; and just now his august presence is thickly smeared with\r\nputz-pomade.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I see!\" cried the Scarecrow, greatly reassured. \"My friend was ever\r\ninclined to be a dandy, and I suppose he is now more proud than ever of his\r\npersonal appearance.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is, indeed,\" said the man, with a polite bow. \"Our mighty Emperor has\r\nlately caused himself to be nickel-plated.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Gracious!\" the Scarecrow exclaimed at hearing this. \"If his wit bears\r\nthe same polish, how sparkling it must be! But show us in--I'm sure the\r\nEmperor will receive us, even in his present state\"\r\n\r\n\"The Emperor's state is always magnificent,\" said the man. \"But I will\r\nventure to tell him of your arrival, and will receive his commands\r\nconcerning you.\"\r\n\r\nSo the party followed the servant into a splendid ante-room, and the Saw-\r\nHorse ambled awkwardly after them, having no knowledge that a horse might be\r\nexpected to remain outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n124\r\n\r\nThe travelers were at first somewhat awed by their surroundings, and even\r\nthe Scarecrow seemed impressed as he examined the rich hangings of silver\r\ncloth caught up into knots and fastened with tiny silver axes. Upon a\r\nhandsome center-table stood a large silver oil-can, richly engraved with\r\nscenes from the past adventures of the Tin Woodman, Dorothy, the Cowardly\r\nLion and the Scarecrow: the lines of the engraving being traced upon the\r\nsilver in yellow gold. On the walls hung several portraits, that of the\r\nScarecrow seeming to be the most prominent and carefully executed, while a\r\nthe large painting of the famous Wizard of Oz, in act of presenting the Tin\r\nWoodman with a heart, covered almost one entire end of the room.\r\n\r\nWhile the visitors gazed at these things in silent admiration they suddenly\r\nheard a loud voice in the next room exclaim:\r\n\r\n\"Well! well! well! What a great surprise!\"\r\n\r\nAnd then the door burst open and Nick Chopper rushed into their midst and\r\ncaught the Scarecrow in a close and loving embrace that creased him into\r\nmany folds and wrinkles.\r\n\r\n\"My dear old friend! My noble comrade!\" cried the Tin Woodman, joyfully.\r\n\"how delighted!,\" I am to meet you once again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n125               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n               CAUGHT THE SCARECROW IN A CLOSE AND LOVING EMBRACE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n126\r\n\r\nAnd then he released the Scarecrow and held him at arms' length while he\r\nsurveyed the beloved, painted features.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! the face of the Scarecrow and many portions of his body bore\r\ngreat blotches of putz-pomade; for the Tin Woodman, in his eagerness to\r\nwelcome his friend, had quite forgotten the condition of his toilet and had\r\nrubbed the thick coating of paste from his own body to that of his comrade.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" said the Scarecrow dolefully. \"What a mess I'm in!\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, my friend,\" returned the Tin Woodman,\" I'll send you to my\r\nImperial Laundry, and you'll come out as good as new.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't I be mangled?\" asked the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed!\" was the reply. \"But tell me, how came your Majesty here? and\r\nwho are your companions?\"\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow, with great politeness, introduced Tip and Jack Pumpkinhead,\r\nand the latter personage seemed to interest the Tin Woodman greatly.\r\n\r\n\"You are not very substantial, I must admit,\" said the Emperor. \"but you are\r\ncertainly unusual, and therefore worthy to become a member of our select\r\nsociety.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank your Majesty, said Jack, humbly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n127               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I hope you are enjoying good health?\" continued the Woodman.\r\n\r\n\"At present, yes;\" replied the Pumpkinhead, with a sigh; \"but I am in\r\nconstant terror of the day when I shall spoil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" said the Emperor--but in a kindly, sympathetic tone. \"Do not,\r\nI beg of you, dampen today's sun with the showers of tomorrow. For before\r\nyour head has time to spoil you can have it canned, and in that way it may\r\nbe preserved indefinitely.\"\r\n\r\nTip, during this conversation, was looking at the Woodman with undisguised\r\namazement, and noticed that the celebrated Emperor of the Winkies was\r\ncomposed entirely of pieces of tin, neatly soldered\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n128\r\nand riveted together into the form of a man. He rattled and clanked a\r\nlittle, as he moved, but in the main he seemed to be most cleverly\r\nconstructed, and his appearance was only marred by the thick coating of\r\npolishing-paste that covered him from head to foot.\r\n\r\nThe boy's intent gaze caused the Tin Woodman to remember that he was not in\r\nthe most presentable condition, so he begged his friends to excuse him while\r\nhe retired to his private apartment and allowed his servants to polish him.\r\nThis was accomplished in a short time, and when the emperor returned his\r\nnickel-plated body shone so magnificently that the Scarecrow heartily\r\ncongratulated him on his improved appearance.\r\n\r\n\"That nickel-plate was, I confess, a happy thought,\" said Nick; \"and it was\r\nthe more necessary because I had become somewhat scratched during my\r\nadventurous experiences. You will observe this engraved star upon my left\r\nbreast. It not only indicates where my excellent heart lies, but covers very\r\nneatly the patch made by the Wonderful Wizard when he placed that valued\r\norgan in my breast with his own skillful hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is your heart, then, a hand-organ?\" asked the Pumpkinhead, curiously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n129\r\n\r\n\"By no means,\" responded the emperor, with dignity. \"It is, I am convinced,\r\na strictly orthodox heart, although somewhat larger and warmer than most\r\npeople possess.\"\r\n\r\nThen he turned to the Scarecrow and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Are your subjects happy and contented, my dear friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot, say\" was the reply. \"for the girls of Oz have risen in revolt and\r\ndriven me out of the emerald City.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Goodness!\" cried the Tin Woodman, \"What a calamity! They surely do\r\nnot complain of your wise and gracious rule?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but they say it is a poor rule that don't work both ways,\" answered the\r\nScarecrow; \"and these females are also of the opinion that men have ruled\r\nthe land long enough. So they have captured my city, robbed the treasury of\r\nall its jewels, and are running things to suit themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me! What an extraordinary idea!\" cried the Emperor, who was both\r\nshocked and surprised.\r\n\r\n\"And I heard some of them say,\" said Tip, \"that they intend to march here\r\nand capture the castle and city of the Tin Woodman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! we must not give them time to do that,\" said the Emperor, quickly; \"we\r\nwill go at once and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n130               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n               RENOVATING HIS MAJESTY, THE SCARECROW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n131\r\nrecapture the Emerald City and place the Scarecrow again upon his throne.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was sure you would help me,\" remarked the Scarecrow in a pleased voice.\r\n\"How large an army can you assemble?\"\r\n\r\n\"We do not need an army,\" replied the Woodman. \"We four, with the aid of my\r\ngleaming axe, are enough to strike terror into the hearts of the rebels.\"\r\n\r\n\"We five,\" corrected the Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n\"Five?\" repeated the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; the Saw-Horse is brave and fearless,\" answered Jack, forgetting his\r\nrecent quarrel with the quadruped.\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman looked around him in a puzzled way, for the Saw-Horse had\r\nuntil now remained quietly standing in a corner, where the Emperor had not\r\nnoticed him. Tip immediately called the odd-looking creature to them, and it\r\napproached so awkwardly that it nearly upset the beautiful center-table and\r\nthe engraved oil-can.\r\n\r\n\"I begin to think,\" remarked the Tin Woodman as he looked earnestly at the\r\nSaw-Horse, \"that wonders will never cease! How came this creature alive?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did it with a magic powder,\" modestly asserted the boy. \"and the Saw-\r\nHorse has been very useful to us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n132\r\n\r\n\"He enabled us to escape the rebels,\" added the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"Then we must surely accept him as a comrade,\" declared the emperor. \"A live\r\nSaw-Horse is a distinct novelty, and should prove an interesting study. Does\r\nhe know anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I cannot claim any great experience in life,\" the Saw-Horse answered\r\nfor himself. \"but I seem to learn very quickly, and often it occurs to me\r\nthat I know more than any of those around me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you do,\" said the emperor; \"for experience does not always mean\r\nwisdom. But time is precious Just now, so let us quickly make preparations\r\nto start upon our Journey.\r\n\r\nThe emperor called his Lord High Chancellor and instructed him how to run\r\nthe kingdom during his absence. Meanwhile the Scarecrow was taken apart and\r\nthe painted sack that served him for a head was carefully laundered and\r\nrestuffed with the brains originally given him by the great Wizard. His\r\nclothes were also cleaned and pressed by the Imperial tailors, and his crown\r\npolished and again sewed upon his head, for the Tin Woodman insisted he\r\nshould not renounce this badge of royalty. The Scarecrow now presented a\r\nvery respectable appearance, and although in no way addicted to vanity he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n133\r\nwas quite pleased with himself and strutted a trifle as he walked. While\r\nthis was being done Tip mended the wooden limbs of Jack Pumpkinhead and made\r\nthem stronger than before, and the Saw-Horse was also inspected to see if he\r\nwas in good working order.\r\n\r\nThen bright and early the next morning they set out upon the return Journey\r\nto the emerald City, the Tin Woodman bearing upon his shoulder a gleaming\r\naxe and leading the way, while the Pumpkinhead rode upon the Saw-Horse and\r\nTip and the Scarecrow walked upon either side to make sure that he didn't\r\nfall off or become damaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n134               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n135               Mr. H. M. Woggle-Bug, T. E.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, General Jinjur--who, you will remember, commanded the Army of Revolt--was\r\nrendered very uneasy by the escape of the Scarecrow from the Emerald\r\nCity. She feared, and with good reason, that if his Majesty and the Tin\r\nWoodman Joined forces, it would mean danger to her and her entire army; for\r\nthe people of Oz had not yet forgotten the deeds of these famous heroes, who\r\nhad passed successfully through so many startling adventures.\r\n\r\nSo Jinjur sent post-haste for old Mombi, the witch, and promised her large\r\nrewards if she would come to the assistance of the rebel army.\r\n\r\nMombi was furious at the trick Tip had played upon her as well as at his\r\nescape and the theft of the precious Powder of Life; so she needed no urging\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n136\r\nto induce her to travel to the Emerald City to assist Jinjur in defeating\r\nthe Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, who had made Tip one of their friends.\r\n\r\nMombi had no sooner arrived at the royal palace than she discovered, by\r\nmeans of her secret magic, that the adventurers were starting upon their\r\nJourney to the Emerald City; so she retired to a small room high up in a\r\ntower and locked herself in while she practised such arts as she could\r\ncommand to prevent the return of the Scarecrow and his companions.\r\n\r\nThat was why the Tin Woodman presently stopped and said:\r\n\r\n\"Something very curious has happened. I ought to know by heart and every\r\nstep of this Journey, yet I fear we have already lost our way.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is quite impossible!\" protested the Scarecrow. \"Why do you think, my\r\ndear friend, that we have gone astray?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, here before us is a great field of sunflowers--and I never saw this\r\nfield before in all my life.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words they all looked around, only to find that they were indeed\r\nsurrounded by a field of tall stalks, every stalk bearing at its top a\r\ngigantic sunflower. And not only were these flowers almost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n137\r\nblinding in their vivid hues of red and gold, but each one whirled around\r\nupon its stalk like a miniature wind-mill, completely dazzling the vision of\r\nthe beholders and so mystifying them that they knew not which way to turn.\r\n\r\n\"It's witchcraft!\" exclaimed Tip.\r\n\r\nWhile they paused, hesitating and wondering, the Tin Woodman uttered a cry\r\nof impatience and advanced with swinging axe to cut down the stalks before\r\nhim. But now the sunflowers suddenly stopped their rapid whirling, and the\r\ntravelers plainly saw a girl's face appear in the center of each flower.\r\nThese lovely faces looked upon the astonished band with mocking smiles, and\r\nthen burst into a chorus of merry laughter at the dismay their appearance\r\ncaused.\r\n\r\n\"Stop! stop!\" cried Tip, seizing the Woodman's arm; \"they're alive! they're\r\ngirls!\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment the flowers began whirling again, and the faces faded away\r\nand were lost in the rapid revolutions.\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman dropped his axe and sat down upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\"It would be heartless to chop down those pretty creatures,\" said he,\r\ndespondently. \"and yet I do not know how else we can proceed upon our way\"\r\n\r\n\"They looked to me strangely like the faces of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n138\r\nthe Army of Revolt,\" mused the Scarecrow. \"But I cannot conceive how the\r\ngirls could have followed us here so quickly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe it's magic,\" said Tip, positively, \"and that someone is playing a\r\ntrick upon us. I've known old Mombi do things like that before. Probably\r\nit's nothing more than an illusion, and there are no sunflowers here at\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let us shut our eyes and walk forward,\" suggested the Woodman.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"My eyes are not painted to shut.\r\nBecause you happen to have tin eyelids, you must not imagine we are all\r\nbuilt in the same way.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the eyes of the Saw-Horse are knot eyes,\" said Jack, leaning forward to\r\nexamine them.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, you must ride quickly forward,\" commanded Tip, \"and we will\r\nfollow after you and so try to escape. My eyes are already so dazzled that I\r\ncan scarcely see.\"\r\n\r\nSo the Pumpkinhead rode boldly forward, and Tip grasped the stub tail of the\r\nSaw-Horse and followed with closed eyes. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman\r\nbrought up the rear, and before they had gone many yards a Joyful shout from\r\nJack announced that the way was clear before them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n139\r\n\r\nThen all paused to look backward, but not a trace of the field of sunflowers\r\nremained.\r\n\r\nMore cheerfully, now they proceeded upon their Journey; but old Mombi had so\r\nchanged the appearance of the landscape that they would surely have been\r\nlost had not the Scarecrow wisely concluded to take their direction from the\r\nsun. For no witch-craft could change the course of the sun, and it was\r\ntherefore a safe guide.\r\n\r\nHowever, other difficulties lay before them. The Saw-Horse stepped into a\r\nrabbit hole and fell to the ground. The Pumpkinhead was pitched high into\r\nthe air, and his history would probably have ended at that exact moment had\r\nnot the Tin Woodman skillfully caught the pumpkin as it descended and saved\r\nit from injury.\r\n\r\nTip soon had it fitted to the neck again and replaced Jack upon his feet.\r\nBut the Saw-Horse did not escape so easily. For when his leg was pulled from\r\nthe rabbit hole it was found to be broken short off, and must be replaced or\r\nrepaired before he could go a step farther.\r\n\r\n\"This is quite serious,\" said the Tin Woodman.\" If there were trees near by\r\nI might soon manufacture another leg for this animal; but I cannot see even\r\na shrub for miles around.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n140               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n               THE TIN WOODMAN SKILLFULLY CAUGHT THE PUMPKIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n141\r\n\r\n\"And there are neither fences nor houses in this part of the land of Oz,\"\r\nadded the Scarecrow, disconsolately.\r\n\r\n\"Then what shall we do?\" enquired the boy.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I must start my brains working,\" replied his Majesty the\r\nScarecrow; \"for experience has, taught me that I can do anything if I but\r\ntake time to think it out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us all think,\" said Tip; \"and perhaps we shall find a way to repair the\r\nSaw-Horse.\"\r\n\r\nSo they sat in a row upon the grass and began to think, while the Saw-Horse\r\noccupied itself by gazing curiously upon its broken limb.\r\n\r\n\"Does it hurt?\" asked the Tin Woodman, in a soft, sympathetic voice.\r\n\r\n\"Not in the least,\" returned the Saw-Horse; \"but my pride is injured to find\r\nthat my anatomy is so brittle.\"\r\n\r\nFor a time the little group remained in silent thought. Presently the Tin\r\nWoodman raised his head and looked over the fields.\r\n\r\n\"What sort of creature is that which approaches us?\" he asked, wonderingly.\r\n\r\nThe others followed his gaze, and discovered coming toward them the most\r\nextraordinary object they had ever beheld. It advanced quickly and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n142\r\nnoiselessly over the soft grass and in a few minutes stood before the\r\nadventurers and regarded them with an astonishment equal to their own.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow was calm under all circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning!\" he said, politely.\r\n\r\nThe stranger removed his hat with a flourish, bowed very low, and then\r\nresponded:\r\n\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, one and all. I hope you are, as an aggregation, enjoying\r\nexcellent health. Permit me to present my card.\"\r\n\r\nWith this courteous speech it extended a card toward the Scarecrow, who\r\naccepted it, turned it over and over, and handed it with a shake of his head\r\nto Tip.\r\n\r\nThe boy read aloud:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"MR. H. M. WOGGLE-BUG, T. E.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n143\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" ejaculated the Pumpkinhead, staring somewhat intently.\r\n\r\n\"How very peculiar!\" said the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\nTip's eyes were round and wondering, and the Saw-Horse uttered a sigh and\r\nturned away its head.\r\n\r\n\"Are you really a Woggle-Bug?\" enquired the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"Most certainly, my dear sir!\" answered the stranger, briskly. \"Is not my\r\nname upon the card?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" said the Scarecrow. \"But may I ask what 'H. M.' stands for?\"\r\n\r\n\"'H. M.' means Highly Magnified,\" returned the Woggle-Bug, proudly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I see.\" The Scarecrow viewed the stranger critically. \"And are you, in\r\ntruth, highly magnified?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said the Woggle-Bug, \"I take you for a gentleman of judgment and\r\ndiscernment. Does it not occur to you that I am several thousand times\r\ngreater than any Woggle-Bug you ever saw before? Therefore it is plainly\r\nevident that I am Highly Magnified, and there is no good reason why you\r\nshould doubt the fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me,\" returned the Scarecrow. \"My brains are slightly mixed since I\r\nwas last laundered. Would it be improper for me to ask, also, what the\r\n'T.E.' at the end of your name stands for?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n144\r\n\r\n\"Those letters express my degree,\" answered the Woggle-Bug, with a\r\ncondescending smile. \"To be more explicit, the initials mean that I am\r\nThoroughly Educated.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said the Scarecrow, much relieved.\r\n\r\nTip had not yet taken his eyes off this wonderful personage. What he saw was\r\na great, round, buglike body supported upon two slender legs which ended in\r\ndelicate feet--the toes curling upward. The body of the Woggle-Bug was\r\nrather flat, and judging from what could be seen of it was of a glistening\r\ndark brown color upon the back, while the front was striped with alternate\r\nbands of light brown and white, blending together at the edges. Its arms\r\nwere fully as slender as its legs, and upon a rather long neck was perched\r\nits head--not unlike the head of a man, except that its nose ended in a\r\ncurling antenna, or \"feeler,\" and its ears from the upper points bore\r\nantennae that decorated the sides of its head like two miniature, curling\r\npig tails. It must be admitted that the round, black eyes were rather\r\nbulging in appearance; but the expression upon the Woggle-Bug's face was by\r\nno means unpleasant.\r\n\r\nFor dress the insect wore a dark-blue swallowtail coat with a yellow silk\r\nlining and a flower in the button-hole; a vest of white duck that stretched\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n145\r\ntightly across the wide body; knickerbockers of fawn-colored plush, fastened\r\nat the knees with gilt buckles; and, perched upon its small head, was\r\njauntily set a tall silk hat.\r\n\r\nStanding upright before our amazed friends the Woggle-Bug appeared to be\r\nfully as tall as the Tin Woodman; and surely no bug in all the Land of Oz\r\nhad ever before attained so enormous a size.\r\n\r\n\"I confess,\" said the Scarecrow, \"that your abrupt appearance has caused me\r\nsurprise, and no doubt has startled my companions. I hope, however, that\r\nthis circumstance will not distress you. We shall probably get used to you\r\nin time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not apologize, I beg of you!\" returned the Woggle-Bug, earnestly. \"It\r\naffords me great pleasure to surprise people; for surely I cannot be classed\r\nwith ordinary insects and am entitled to both curiosity and admiration from\r\nthose I meet.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are, indeed,\" agreed his Majesty.\r\n\r\n\"If you will permit me to seat myself in your august company,\" continued the\r\nstranger, \"I will gladly relate my history, so that you will be better able\r\nto comprehend my unusual--may I say remarkable?--appearance.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may say what you please,\" answered the Tin Woodman, briefly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n146\r\n\r\nSo the Woggle-Bug sat down upon the grass, facing the little group of\r\nwanderers, and told them the following story:\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147               A Highly Magnified History\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is but honest that I should acknowledge at the beginning of my recital\r\nthat I was born an ordinary Woggle-Bug,\" began the creature, in a frank and\r\nfriendly tone. \"Knowing no better, I used my arms as well as my legs for\r\nwalking, and crawled under the edges of stones or hid among the roots of\r\ngrasses with no thought beyond finding a few insects smaller than myself to\r\nfeed upon.\r\n\r\n\"The chill nights rendered me stiff and motionless, for I wore no clothing,\r\nbut each morning the warm rays of the sun gave me new life and restored me\r\nto activity. A horrible existence is this, but you must remember it is the\r\nregular ordained existence of Woggle-Bugs, as well as of many other tiny\r\ncreatures that inhabit the earth.\r\n\r\n\"But Destiny had singled me out, humble though I was, for a grander fate!\r\nOne day I crawled near\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n148\r\nto a country school house, and my curiosity being excited by the monotonous\r\nhum of the students within, I made bold to enter and creep along a crack\r\nbetween two boards until I reached the far end, where, in front of a hearth\r\nof glowing embers, sat the master at his desk.\r\n\r\n\"No one noticed so small a creature as a Woggle-Bug, and when I found that\r\nthe hearth was even warmer and more comfortable than the sunshine, I\r\nresolved to establish my future home beside it. So I found a charming nest\r\nbetween two bricks and hid myself therein for many, many months.\r\n\r\n\"Professor Nowitall is, doubtless, the most famous scholar in the land of\r\nOz, and after a few days I began to listen to the lectures and discourses he\r\ngave his pupils. Not one of them was more attentive than the humble,\r\nunnoticed Woggle-Bug, and I acquired in this way a fund of knowledge that I\r\nwill myself confess is simply marvelous. That is why I place 'T.E.'\r\nThoroughly Educated upon my cards; for my greatest pride lies in the fact\r\nthat the world cannot produce another Woggle-Bug with a tenth part of my own\r\nculture and erudition.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not blame you,\" said the Scarecrow. \"Education is a thing to be proud\r\nof. I'm educated myself. The mess of brains given me by the Great\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n149\r\nWizard is considered by my friends to be unexcelled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" interrupted the Tin Woodman, \"a good heart is, I believe,\r\nmuch more desirable than education or brains.\"\r\n\r\n\"To me,\" said the Saw-Horse, \"a good leg is more desirable than either.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could seeds be considered in the light of brains?\" enquired the\r\nPumpkinhead, abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"Keep quiet!\" commanded Tip, sternly.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, dear father,\" answered the obedient Jack.\r\n\r\nThe Woggle-Bug listened patiently--even respectfully--to these remarks,\r\nand then resumed his story.\r\n\r\n\"I must have lived fully three years in that secluded school-house hearth,\"\r\nsaid he, \"drinking thirstily of the ever-flowing fount of limpid knowledge\r\nbefore me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite poetical,\" commented the Scarecrow, nodding his head approvingly.\r\n\r\n\"But one, day\" continued the Bug, \"a marvelous circumstance occurred that\r\naltered my very existence and brought me to my present pinnacle of\r\ngreatness. The\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n150\r\nProfessor discovered me in the act of crawling across the hearth, and before\r\nI could escape he had caught me between his thumb and forefinger.\r\n\r\n\"'My dear children,' said he, 'I have captured a Woggle-Bug--a very rare\r\nand interesting specimen. Do any of you know what a Woggle-Bug is?'\r\n\r\n\"'No!' yelled the scholars, in chorus.\r\n\r\n\"'Then,' said the Professor, 'I will get out my famous magnifying-glass and\r\nthrow the insect upon a screen in a highly-magnified condition, that you may\r\nall study carefully its peculiar construction and become acquainted with its\r\nhabits and manner of life.'\r\n\r\n\"He then brought from a cupboard a most curious instrument, and before I\r\ncould realize what had happened I found myself thrown upon a screen in a\r\nhighly-magnified state--even as you now behold me.\r\n\r\n\"The students stood up on their stools and craned their heads forward to get\r\na better view of me, and two little girls jumped upon the sill of an open\r\nwindow where they could see more plainly.\r\n\r\n\"'Behold!' cried the Professor, in a loud voice, 'this highly-magnified\r\nWoggle-Bug; one of the most curious insects in existence!'\r\n\r\n\"Being Thoroughly Educated, and knowing what is required of a cultured\r\ngentleman, at this juncture I stood upright and, placing my hand upon my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n151               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n               \"THEE STUDENTS STOOD UP ON THEIR STOOLS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n152\r\nbosom, made a very polite bow. My action, being unexpected, must have\r\nstartled them, for one of the little girls perched upon the window-sill gave\r\na scream and fell backward out the window, drawing her companion with her as\r\nshe disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"The Professor uttered a cry of horror and rushed away through the door to\r\nsee if the poor children were injured by the fall. The scholars followed\r\nafter him in a wild mob, and I was left alone in the school-room, still in a\r\nHighly-Magnified state and free to do as I pleased.\r\n\r\n\"It immediately occurred to me that this was a good opportunity to escape. I\r\nwas proud of my great size, and realized that now I could safely travel\r\nanywhere in the world, while my superior culture would make me a fit\r\nassociate for the most learned person I might chance to meet.\r\n\r\n\"So, while the Professor picked the little girls--who were more frightened\r\nthan hurt--off the ground, and the pupils clustered around him closely\r\ngrouped, I calmly walked out of the school-house, turned a corner, and\r\nescaped unnoticed to a grove of trees that stood near\"\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful!\" exclaimed the Pumpkinhead, admiringly.\r\n\r\n\"It was, indeed,\" agreed the Woggle-Bug. \"I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n153\r\nhave never ceased to congratulate myself for escaping while I was Highly\r\nMagnified; for even my excess-\r\n\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\nive knowledge would have proved of little use to me had I remained a tiny,\r\ninsignificant insect.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know before,\" said Tip, looking at the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n154\r\nWoggle-Bug with a puzzled expression, \"that insects wore clothes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor do they, in their natural state,\" returned the stranger. \"But in the\r\ncourse of my wanderings I had the good fortune to save the ninth life of a\r\ntailor--tailors having, like cats, nine lives, as you probably know. The\r\nfellow was exceedingly grateful, for had he lost that ninth life it would\r\nhave been the end of him; so he begged permission to furnish me with the\r\nstylish costume I now wear. It fits very nicely, does it not?\" and the\r\nWoggle-Bug stood up and turned himself around slowly, that all might examine\r\nhis person.\r\n\r\n\"He must have been a good tailor,\" said the Scarecrow, somewhat enviously.\r\n\r\n\"He was a good-hearted tailor, at any rate,\" observed Nick Chopper.\r\n\r\n\"But where were you going, when you met us?\" Tip asked the Woggle-Bug.\r\n\r\n\"Nowhere in particular,\" was the reply, \"although it is my intention soon to\r\nvisit the Emerald City and arrange to give a course of lectures to select\r\naudiences on the 'Advantages of Magnification.'\"\r\n\r\n\"We are bound for the Emerald City now,\" said the Tin Woodman; \"so, if it\r\npleases you to do so, you are welcome to travel in our company.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n155\r\n\r\nThe Woggle-Bug bowed with profound grace.\r\n\r\n\"It will give me great pleasure,\" said he \"to accept your kind invitation;\r\nfor nowhere in the Land of Oz could I hope to meet with so congenial a\r\ncompany.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" acknowledged the Pumpkinhead. \"We are quite as congenial as\r\nflies and honey.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--pardon me if I seem inquisitive--are you not all rather--ahem!\r\nrather unusual?\" asked the Woggle-Bug, looking from one to another with\r\nunconcealed interest.\r\n\r\n\"Not more so than yourself,\" answered the Scarecrow. \"Everything in life is\r\nunusual until you get accustomed to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What rare philosophy!\" exclaimed the Woggle-Bug, admiringly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; my brains are working well today,\" admitted the Scarecrow, an accent\r\nof pride in his voice.\r\n\r\n\"Then, if you are sufficiently rested and refreshed, let us bend our steps\r\ntoward the Emerald City,\" suggested the magnified one.\r\n\r\n\"We can't,\" said Tip. \"The Saw-Horse has broken a leg, so he can't bend his\r\nsteps. And there is no wood around to make him a new limb from. And we can't\r\nleave the horse behind because the Pumpkinhead is so stiff in his Joints\r\nthat he has to ride.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n156\r\n\r\n\"How very unfortunate!\" cried the Woggle-Bug. Then he looked the party over\r\ncarefully and said:\r\n\r\n\"If the Pumpkinhead is to ride, why not use one of his legs to make a leg\r\nfor the horse that carries him? I judge that both are made of wood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, that is what I call real cleverness,\" said the Scarecrow, approvingly.\r\n\"I wonder my brains  did not think of that long ago! Get to work, my dear\r\nNick, and fit the Pumpkinhead's leg to the Saw-Horse.\"\r\n\r\nJack was not especially pleased with this idea; but he submitted to having\r\nhis left leg amputated by the Tin Woodman and whittled down to fit the left\r\nleg of the Saw-Horse. Nor was the Saw-Horse especially pleased with the\r\noperation, either; for he growled a good deal about being \"butchered,\" as he\r\ncalled it, and afterward declared that the new leg was a disgrace to a\r\nrespectable Saw-Horse.\r\n\r\n\"I beg you to be more careful in your speech,\" said the Pumpkinhead,\r\nsharply. \"Remember, if you please, that it is my leg you are abusing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot forget it,\" retorted the Saw-Horse, \"for it is quite as flimsy as\r\nthe rest of your person.\"\r\n\r\n\"Flimsy! me flimsy!\" cried Jack, in a rage. \"How dare you call me flimsy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you are built as absurdly as a jumping-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n157\r\njack,\" sneered the horse, rolling his knotty eyes in a vicious manner. \"Even\r\nyour head won't stay straight, and you never can tell whether you are\r\nlooking backwards or forwards!\"\r\n\r\n\"Friends, I entreat you not to quarrel!\" pleaded the Tin Woodman,\r\nanxiously.\" As a matter of fact, we are none of us above criticism; so let\r\nus bear with each others' faults.\"\r\n\r\n\"An excellent suggestion,\" said the Woggle-Bug, approvingly. \"You must have\r\nan excellent heart, my metallic friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have,\" returned Nick, well pleased. \"My heart is quite the best part of\r\nme. But now let us start upon our Journey.\r\n\r\nThey perched the one-legged Pumpkinhead upon the Saw-Horse, and tied him to\r\nhis seat with cords, so that he could not possibly fall off.\r\n\r\nAnd then, following the lead of the Scarecrow, they all advanced in the\r\ndirection of the Emerald City.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n158               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n159               Old Mombi indulges in Witchcraft\r\n\r\n\r\nThey soon discovered that the Saw-Horse limped, for his new leg was a trifle\r\ntoo long. So they were obliged to halt while the Tin Woodman chopped it down\r\nwith his axe, after which the wooden steed paced along more comfortably. But\r\nthe Saw-Horse was not entirely satisfied, even yet.\r\n\r\n\"It was a shame that I broke my other leg!\" it growled.\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary,\" airily remarked the Woggle-Bug, who was walking\r\nalongside, \"you should consider the accident most fortunate. For a horse is\r\nnever of much use until he has been broken.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Tip, rather provoked, for he felt a warm interest\r\nin both the Saw-Horse and his man Jack; \"but permit me to say that your joke\r\nis a poor one, and as old as it is poor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n160\r\n\r\n\"Still, it is a Joke,\" declared the Woggle-Bug; firmly, \"and a Joke derived\r\nfrom a play upon words is considered among educated people to be eminently\r\nproper.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does that mean?\" enquired the Pumpkinhead, stupidly.\r\n\r\n\"It means, my dear friend,\" explained the Woggle-Bug, \"that our language\r\ncontains many words having a double meaning; and that to pronounce a joke\r\nthat allows both meanings of a certain word, proves the joker a person of\r\nculture and refinement, who has, moreover, a thorough command of the\r\nlanguage.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe that,\" said Tip, plainly; \"anybody can make a pun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so,\" rejoined the Woggle-Bug, stiffly. \"It requires education of a high\r\norder. Are you educated, young sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not especially,\" admitted Tip.\r\n\r\n\"Then you cannot judge the matter. I myself am Thoroughly Educated, and I\r\nsay that puns display genius. For instance, were I to ride upon this Saw-\r\nHorse, he would not only be an animal he would become an equipage. For he\r\nwould then be a horse-and-buggy.\"\r\n\r\nAt this the Scarecrow gave a gasp and the Tin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n161\r\nWoodman stopped short and looked reproachfully at the Woggle-Bug. At the\r\nsame time the Saw-Horse loudly snorted his derision; and even the\r\nPumpkinhead put up his hand to hide the smile which, because it was carved\r\nupon his face, he could not change to a frown.\r\n\r\nBut the Woggle-Bug strutted along as if he had made some brilliant remark,\r\nand the Scarecrow was obliged to say:\r\n\r\n\"I have heard, my dear friend, that a person can become over-educated; and\r\nalthough I have a high respect for brains, no matter how they may be\r\narranged or classified, I begin to suspect that yours are slightly tangled.\r\nIn any event, I must beg you to restrain your superior education while in\r\nour society.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are not very particular,\" added the Tin Woodman; \"and we are exceedingly\r\nkind hearted. But if your superior culture gets leaky again--\" He did not\r\ncomplete the sentence, but he twirled his gleaming axe so carelessly that\r\nthe Woggle-Bug looked frightened, and shrank away to a safe distance.\r\n\r\nThe others marched on in silence, and the Highly Magnified one, after a\r\nperiod of deep thought, said in an humble voice:\r\n\r\n\"I will endeavor to restrain myself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n162\r\n\r\n\"That is all we can expect,\" returned the Scarecrow pleasantly; and good\r\nnature being thus happily restored to the party, they proceeded upon their\r\nway.\r\n\r\nWhen they again stopped to allow Tip to rest--the boy being the only one\r\nthat seemed to tire--the Tin Woodman noticed many small, round holes in\r\nthe grassy meadow.\r\n\r\n\"This must be a village of the Field Mice,\" he said to the Scarecrow.\" I\r\nwonder if my old friend, the Queen of the Mice, is in this neighborhood.\"\r\n\r\n\"If she is, she may be of great service to us,\" answered the Scarecrow, who\r\nwas impressed by a sudden thought. \"See if you can call her, my dear Nick.\"\r\n\r\nSo the Tin Woodman blew a shrill note upon a silver whistle that hung around\r\nhis neck, and presently a tiny grey mouse popped from a near-by hole and\r\nadvanced fearlessly toward them. For the Tin Woodman had once saved her\r\nlife, and the Queen of the Field Mice knew he was to be trusted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good day, your Majesty, said Nick, politely addressing the mouse; \"I trust\r\nyou are enjoying good health?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, I am quite well,\" answered the Queen, demurely, as she sat up\r\nand displayed the tiny golden crown upon her head. \"Can I do anything to\r\nassist my old friends?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n163\r\n\r\n\"You can, indeed,\" replied the Scarecrow, eagerly. \"Let me, I intreat you,\r\ntake a dozen of your subjects with me to the Emerald City.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will they be injured in any way?\" asked the Queen, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"I think not,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"I will carry them hidden in the straw\r\nwhich stuffs my body, and when I give them the signal by unbuttoning my\r\njacket, they have only to rush out and scamper home again as fast as they\r\ncan. By doing this they will assist me to regain my throne, which the Army\r\nof Revolt has taken from me.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" said the Queen, \"I will not refuse your request. Whenever\r\nyou are ready, I will call twelve of my most intelligent subjects.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am ready now\" returned the Scarecrow. Then he lay flat upon the ground\r\nand unbuttoned his jacket, displaying the mass of straw with which he was\r\nstuffed.\r\n\r\nThe Queen uttered a little piping call, and in an instant a dozen pretty\r\nfield mice had emerged from their holes and stood before their ruler,\r\nawaiting her orders.\r\n\r\nWhat the Queen said to them none of our travelers could understand, for it\r\nwas in the mouse language; but the field mice obeyed without hesitation,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n164\r\nrunning one after the other to the Scarecrow and hiding themselves in the\r\nstraw of his breast.\r\n\r\nWhen all of the twelve mice had thus concealed themselves, the Scarecrow\r\nbuttoned his Jacket securely and then arose and thanked the Queen for her\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\n\"One thing more you might do to serve us,\" suggested the Tin Woodman; \"and\r\nthat is to run ahead and show us the way to the Emerald City. For some enemy\r\nis evidently trying to prevent us from reaching it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do that gladly,\" returned the Queen. \"Are you ready?\"\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman looked at Tip.\r\n\r\n\"I'm rested,\" said the boy. \"Let us start.\"\r\n\r\nThen they resumed their journey, the little grey  Queen of the Field Mice\r\nrunning swiftly ahead and then pausing until the travelers drew near, when\r\naway she would dart again.\r\n\r\nWithout this unerring guide the Scarecrow and his comrades might never have\r\ngained the Emerald City; for many were the obstacles thrown in their way by\r\nthe arts of old Mombi. Yet not one of the obstacles really existed--all\r\nwere cleverly contrived deceptions. For when they came to the banks of a\r\nrushing river that threatened to bar their way the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n165\r\nlittle Queen kept steadily on, passing through the seeming flood in safety;\r\nand our travelers followed her without encountering a single drop of water.\r\n\r\nAgain, a high wall of granite towered high above their heads and opposed\r\ntheir advance. But the grey Field Mouse walked straight through it, and the\r\nothers did the same, the wall melting into mist as they passed it.\r\n\r\nAfterward, when they had stopped for a moment to allow Tip to rest, they saw\r\nforty roads branching off from their feet in forty different directions; and\r\nsoon these forty roads began whirling around like a mighty wheel, first in\r\none direction and then in the other, completely bewildering their vision.\r\n\r\nBut the Queen called for them to follow her and darted off in a straight\r\nline; and when they had gone a few paces the whirling pathways vanished and\r\nwere seen no more.\r\n\r\nMombi's last trick was the most fearful of all. She sent a sheet of\r\ncrackling flame rushing over the meadow to consume them; and for the first\r\ntime the Scarecrow became afraid and turned to fly.\r\n\r\n\"If that fire reaches me I will be gone in no time!\" said he, trembling\r\nuntil his straw rattled. \"It's the most dangerous thing I ever encountered.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm off, too!\" cried the Saw-Horse, turning and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n166\r\nprancing with agitation; \"for my wood is so dry it would burn like\r\nkindlings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is fire dangerous to pumpkins?\" asked Jack, fearfully.\r\n\r\n\"You'll be baked like a tart--and so will I!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\nanswered the Woggle-Bug, getting down on all fours so he could run the\r\nfaster.\r\n\r\nBut the Tin Woodman, having no fear of fire, averted the stampede by a few\r\nsensible words.\r\n\r\n\"Look at the Field Mouse!\" he shouted. \"The fire does not burn her in the\r\nleast. In fact, it is no fire at all, but only a deception.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n167\r\n\r\nIndeed, to watch the little Queen march calmly through the advancing flames\r\nrestored courage to every member of the party, and they followed her without\r\nbeing even scorched.\r\n\r\n\"This is surely a most extraordinary adventure,\" said the Woggle-Bug, who\r\nwas greatly amazed; \"for it upsets all the Natural Laws that I heard\r\nProfessor Nowitall teach in the school-house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course it does,\" said the Scarecrow, wisely. \"All magic is unnatural,\r\nand for that reason is to be feared and avoided. But I see before us the\r\ngates of the Emerald City, so I imagine we have now overcome all the magical\r\nobstacles that seemed to oppose us.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, the walls of the City were plainly visible, and the Queen of the\r\nField Mice, who had guided them so faithfully, came near to bid them good-\r\nbye.\r\n\r\n\"We are very grateful to your Majesty for your kind assistance,\" said the\r\nTin Woodman, bowing before the pretty creature.\r\n\r\n\"I am always pleased to be of service to my friends,\" answered the Queen,\r\nand in a flash she had darted away upon her journey home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n168               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n169               The Prisoners of the Queen\r\n\r\n\r\nApproaching the gateway of the Emerald City the travelers found it guarded\r\nby two girls of the Army of Revolt, who opposed their entrance by drawing\r\nthe knitting-needles from their hair and threatening to prod the first that\r\ncame near.\r\n\r\nBut the Tin Woodman was not afraid.\"\r\n\r\nAt the worst they can but scratch my beautiful nickel-plate,\" he said. \"But\r\nthere will be no 'worst,' for I think I can manage to frighten these absurd\r\nsoldiers very easily. Follow me closely, all of you!\"\r\n\r\nThen, swinging his axe in a great circle to right and left before him, he\r\nadvanced upon the gate, and the others followed him without hesitation.\r\n\r\nThe girls, who had expected no resistance whatever, were terrified by the\r\nsweep of the glittering axe and fled screaming into the city; so that our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n170\r\ntravelers passed the gates in safety and marched down the green marble\r\npavement of the wide street toward the royal palace.\r\n\r\n\"At this rate we will soon have your Majesty upon the throne again,\" said\r\nthe Tin Woodman, laughing at his easy conquest of the guards.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, friend Nick,\" returned the Scarecrow, gratefully. \"Nothing can\r\nresist your kind heart and your sharp axe.\"\r\n\r\nAs they passed the rows of houses they saw through the open doors that men\r\nwere sweeping and dusting and washing dishes, while the women sat around in\r\ngroups, gossiping and laughing.\r\n\r\n\"What has happened?\" the Scarecrow asked a sad-looking man with a bushy\r\nbeard, who wore an apron and was wheeling a baby-carriage along the\r\nsidewalk.\r\n\r\n\"Why, we've had a revolution, your Majesty as you ought to know very well,\"\r\nreplied the man; \"and since you went away the women have been running things\r\nto suit themselves. I'm glad you have decided to come back and restore\r\norder, for doing housework and minding the children is wearing out the\r\nstrength of every man in the Emerald City.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hm!\" said the Scarecrow, thoughtfully. \"If it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n171\r\nis such hard work as you say, how did the women manage it so easily?\"\r\n\r\n\"I really do not know\" replied the man, with a deep sigh. \"Perhaps the women\r\nare made of castiron.\"\r\n\r\nNo movement was made, as they passed along the street, to oppose their\r\nprogress. Several of the women stopped their gossip long enough to cast\r\ncurious looks upon our friends, but immediately they would turn away with a\r\nlaugh or a sneer and resume their chatter. And when they met with several\r\ngirls belonging to the Army of Revolt, those soldiers, instead of being\r\nalarmed or appearing surprised, merely stepped out of the way and allowed\r\nthem to advance without protest.\r\n\r\nThis action rendered the Scarecrow uneasy.\"\r\n\r\nI'm afraid we are walking into a trap,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" returned Nick Chopper, confidently; \"the silly creatures are\r\nconquered already!\"\r\n\r\nBut the Scarecrow shook his head in a way that expressed doubt, and Tip\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"It's too easy, altogether. Look out for trouble ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" returned his Majesty. Unopposed they reached the royal palace and\r\nmarched up the marble steps, which had once been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n172               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n               \"IT'S TOO EASY, ALTOGETHER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n173\r\nthickly crusted with emeralds but were now filled with tiny holes where the\r\njewels had been ruthlessly torn from their settings by the Army of Revolt.\r\nAnd so far not a rebel barred their way.\r\n\r\nThrough the arched hallways and into the magnificent throne room marched the\r\nTin Woodman and his followers, and here, when the green silken curtains fell\r\nbehind them, they saw a curious sight.\r\n\r\nSeated within the glittering throne was General Jinjur, with the Scarecrow's\r\nsecond-best crown upon her head, and the royal sceptre in her right hand. A\r\nbox of caramels, from which she was eating, rested in her lap, and the girl\r\nseemed entirely at ease in her royal surroundings.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow stepped forward and confronted her, while the Tin Woodman\r\nleaned upon his axe and the others formed a half-circle back of his\r\nMajesty's person.\r\n\r\n\"How dare you sit in my throne?\" demanded the Scarecrow, sternly eyeing the\r\nintruder. \"Don't you know you are guilty of treason, and that there is a law\r\nagainst treason?\"\r\n\r\n\"The throne belongs to whoever is able to take it,\" answered Jinjur, as she\r\nslowly ate another caramel. \"I have taken it, as you see; so just now I am\r\nthe Queen, and all who oppose me are guilty of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n174\r\ntreason, and must be punished by the law you have just mentioned.\"\r\n\r\nThis view of the case puzzled the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"How is it, friend Nick?\" he asked, turning to the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n\"Why, when it comes to Law, I have nothing to, say\" answered that personage.\r\n\"for laws were never meant to be understood, and it is foolish to make the\r\nattempt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what shall we do?\" asked the Scarecrow, in dismay.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you marry the Queen? And then you can both rule,\" suggested the\r\nWoggle-Bug.\r\n\r\nJinjur glared at the insect fiercely. \"Why don't you send her back to her\r\nmother, where she belongs?\" asked Jack Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\nJinjur frowned.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you shut her up in a closet until she behaves herself, and\r\npromises to be good?\" enquired Tip. Jinjur's lip curled scornfully.\r\n\r\n\"Or give her a good shaking!\" added the Saw-Horse.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the Tin Woodman, \"we must treat the poor girl with gentleness.\r\nLet us give her all the Jewels she can carry, and send her away happy and\r\ncontented.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n175\r\n\r\nAt this Queen Jinjur laughed aloud, and the next minute clapped her pretty\r\nhands together thrice, as if for a signal.\r\n\r\n\"You are very absurd creatures,\" said she; \"but I am tired of your nonsense\r\nand have no time to bother with you longer.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the monarch and his friends listened in amazement to this impudent\r\nspeech, a startling thing happened. The Tin Woodman's axe was snatched from\r\nhis grasp by some person behind him, and he found himself disarmed and\r\nhelpless. At the same instant a shout of laughter rang in the ears of the\r\ndevoted band, and turning to see whence this came they found themselves\r\nsurrounded by the Army of Revolt, the girls bearing in either hand their\r\nglistening knitting-needles. The entire throne room seemed to be filled with\r\nthe rebels, and the Scarecrow and his comrades realized that they were\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\n\"You see how foolish it is to oppose a woman's wit,\" said Jinjur, gaily;\r\n\"and this event only proves that I am more fit to rule the Emerald City than\r\na Scarecrow. I bear you no ill will, I assure you; but lest you should prove\r\ntroublesome to me in the future I shall order you all to be destroyed. That\r\nis, all except the boy, who belongs to old Mombi and must be restored to her\r\nkeeping. The rest of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n176\r\nyou are not human, and therefore it will not be wicked to demolish you. The\r\nSaw-Horse and the Pumpkinhead's body I will have chopped up for kindling-\r\nwood; and the pumpkin shall be made into tarts. The Scarecrow will do nicely\r\nto start a bonfire, and the tin man can be cut into small pieces and fed to\r\nthe goats. As for this immense Woggle-Bug--\"\r\n\r\n\"Highly Magnified, if you please!\" interrupted the insect.\r\n\r\n\"I think I will ask the cook to make green-turtle soup of you,\" continued\r\nthe Queen, reflectively.\r\n\r\nThe Woggle-Bug shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"Or, if that won't do, we might use you for a Hungarian goulash, stewed and\r\nhighly spiced,\" she added, cruelly.\r\n\r\nThis programme of extermination was so terrible that the prisoners looked\r\nupon one another in a panic of fear. The Scarecrow alone did not give way to\r\ndespair. He stood quietly before the Queen and his brow was wrinkled in deep\r\nthought as he strove to find some means to escape.\r\n\r\nWhile thus engaged he felt the straw within his breast move gently. At once\r\nhis expression changed from sadness to joy, and raising his hand he quickly\r\nunbuttoned the front of his jacket.\r\n\r\nThis action did not pass unnoticed by the crowd\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n177\r\nof girls clustering about him, but none of them suspected what he was doing\r\nuntil a tiny grey mouse leaped from his bosom to the floor and scampered\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\naway between the feet of the Army of Revolt. Another mouse quickly followed;\r\nthen another and another, in rapid succession. And suddenly such a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n178\r\nscream of terror went up from the Army that it might easily have filled the\r\nstoutest heart with consternation. The flight that ensued turned to a\r\nstampede, and the stampede to a panic.\r\n\r\nFor while the startled mice rushed wildly about the room the Scarecrow had\r\nonly time to note a whirl of skirts and a twinkling of feet as the girls\r\ndisappeared from the palace--pushing and crowding one another in their mad\r\nefforts to escape.\r\n\r\nThe Queen, at the first alarm, stood up on the cushions of the throne and\r\nbegan to dance frantically upon her tiptoes. Then a mouse ran up the\r\ncushions, and with a terrified leap poor Jinjur shot clear over the head of\r\nthe Scarecrow and escaped through an archway--never pausing in her wild\r\ncareer until she had reached the city gates.\r\n\r\nSo, in less time than I can explain, the throne room was deserted by all\r\nsave the Scarecrow and his friends, and the Woggle-Bug heaved a deep sigh of\r\nrelief as he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Thank goodness, we are saved!\"\r\n\r\n\"For a time, yes;\" answered the Tin Woodman. \"But the enemy will soon\r\nreturn, I fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us bar all the entrances to the palace!\" said the Scarecrow. \"Then we\r\nshall have time to think what is best to be done.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n179\r\n\r\nSo all except Jack Pumpkinhead, who was still tied fast to the Saw-Horse,\r\nran to the various entrances of the royal palace and closed the heavy doors,\r\nbolting and locking them securely. Then, knowing that the Army of Revolt\r\ncould not batter down the barriers in several days, the adventurers gathered\r\nonce more in the throne room for a council of war.\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n180               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n181               The Scarecrow Takes Time to Think\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" began the Scarecrow, when all were again assembled in the\r\nthrone room, \"that the girl Jinjur is quite right in claiming to be Queen.\r\nAnd if she is right, then I am wrong, and we have no business to be\r\noccupying her palace.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you were the King until she came,\" said the Woggle-Bug, strutting up\r\nand down with his hands in his pockets; \"so it appears to me that she is the\r\ninterloper instead of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Especially as we have just conquered her and put her to flight,\" added the\r\nPumpkinhead, as he raised his hands to turn his face toward the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"Have we really conquered her?\" asked the Scarecrow, quietly. \"Look out of\r\nthe window, and tell me what you see.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n182\r\n\r\nTip ran to the window and looked out.\r\n\r\n\"The palace is surrounded by a double row of girl soldiers,\" he announced.\r\n\r\n\"I thought so,\" returned the Scarecrow. \"We are as truly their prisoners as\r\nwe were before the mice frightened them from the palace.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend is right,\" said Nick Chopper, who had been polishing his breast\r\nwith a bit of chamois-leather. \"Jinjur is still the Queen, and we are her\r\nprisoners.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I hope she cannot get at us,\" exclaimed the Pumpkinhead, with a shiver\r\nof fear. \"She threatened to make tarts of me, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry,\" said the Tin Woodman. \"It cannot matter greatly. If you stay\r\nshut up here you will spoil in time, anyway. A good tart is far more\r\nadmirable than a decayed intellect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true,\" agreed the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear!\" moaned Jack; \"what an unhappy lot is mine! Why, dear father, did\r\nyou not make me out of tin--or even out of straw--so that I would keep\r\nindefinitely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shucks!\" returned Tip, indignantly. \"You ought to be glad that I made you\r\nat all.\" Then he added, reflectively, \"everything has to come to an end,\r\nsome time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n183\r\n\r\n\"But I beg to remind you,\" broke in the Woggle-Bug, who had a distressed\r\nlook in his bulging, round eyes, \"that this terrible Queen Jinjur suggested\r\nmaking a goulash of me--Me! the only Highly Magnified and Thoroughly\r\nEducated Woggle-Bug in the wide, wide world!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it was a brilliant idea,\" remarked the Scarecrow, approvingly.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you imagine he would make a better soup?\" asked the Tin Woodman,\r\nturning toward his friend.\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps,\" acknowledged the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\nThe Woggle-Bug groaned.\r\n\r\n\"I can see, in my mind's eye,\" said he, mournfully, \"the goats eating small\r\npieces of my dear comrade, the Tin Woodman, while my soup is being cooked on\r\na bonfire built of the Saw-Horse and Jack Pumpkinhead's body, and Queen\r\nJinjur watches me boil while she feeds the flames with my friend the\r\nScarecrow!\"\r\n\r\nThis morbid picture cast a gloom over the entire party, making them restless\r\nand anxious.\r\n\r\n\"It can't happen for some time,\" said the Tin Woodman, trying to speak\r\ncheerfully; \"for we shall be able to keep Jinjur out of the palace until she\r\nmanages to break down the doors.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n184\r\n\r\n\"And in the meantime I am liable to starve to death, and so is the Woggle-\r\nBug,\" announced Tip.\r\n\r\n\"As for me,\" said the Woggle-Bug, \"I think that I could live for some time\r\non Jack Pumpkinhead. Not that I prefer pumpkins for food; but I believe they\r\nare somewhat nutritious, and Jack's head is large and plump.\"\r\n\r\n\"How heartless!\" exclaimed the Tin Woodman, greatly shocked. \"Are we\r\ncannibals, let me ask? Or are we faithful friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see very clearly that we cannot stay shut up in this palace,\" said the\r\nScarecrow, with decision. \"So let us end this mournful talk and try to\r\ndiscover a means to escape.\"\r\n\r\nAt this suggestion they all gathered eagerly around the throne, wherein was\r\nseated the Scarecrow, and as Tip sat down upon a stool there fell from his\r\npocket a pepper-box, which rolled upon the floor.\r\n\r\n\"What is this?\" asked Nick Chopper, picking up the box.\r\n\r\n\"Be careful!\" cried the boy. \"That's my Powder of Life. Don't spill it, for\r\nit is nearly gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is the Powder of Life?\" enquired the Scarecrow, as Tip replaced\r\nthe box carefully in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"It's some magical stuff old Mombi got from a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n185\r\ncrooked sorcerer,\" explained the boy. \"She brought Jack to life with it, and\r\nafterward I used it to bring the Saw-Horse to life. I guess it will make\r\nanything live that is sprinkled with it; but there's only about one dose\r\nleft.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it is very precious,\" said the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed it is,\" agreed the Scarecrow. \"It may prove our best means of escape\r\nfrom our difficulties. I believe I will think for a few minutes; so I will\r\nthank you, friend Tip, to get out your knife and rip this heavy crown from\r\nmy forehead.\"\r\n\r\nTip soon cut the stitches that had fastened the crown to the Scarecrow's\r\nhead, and the former monarch of the Emerald City removed it with a sigh of\r\nrelief and hung it on a peg beside the throne.\r\n\r\n\"That is my last memento of royalty\" said he; \"and I'm glad to get rid of\r\nit. The former King of this City,\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n186\r\nwho was named Pastoria, lost the crown to the Wonderful Wizard, who passed\r\nit on to me. Now the girl Jinjur claims it, and I sincerely hope it will not\r\ngive her a headache.\"\r\n\r\n\"A kindly thought, which I greatly admire,\" said the Tin Woodman, nodding\r\napprovingly.\r\n\r\n\"And now I will indulge in a quiet think,\" continued the Scarecrow, lying\r\nback in the throne.\r\n\r\nThe others remained as silent and still as possible, so as not to disturb\r\nhim; for all had great confidence in the extraordinary brains of the\r\nScarecrow.\r\n\r\nAnd, after what seemed a very long time indeed to the anxious watchers, the\r\nthinker sat up, looked upon his friends with his most whimsical expression,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\"My brains work beautifully today. I'm quite proud of them. Now, listen! If\r\nwe attempt to escape through the doors of the palace we shall surely be\r\ncaptured. And, as we can't escape through the ground, there is only one\r\nother thing to be done. We must escape through the air!\"\r\n\r\nHe paused to note the effect of these words; but all his hearers seemed\r\npuzzled and unconvinced.\r\n\r\n\"The Wonderful Wizard escaped in a balloon,\" he continued. \"We don't know\r\nhow to make a balloon, of course; but any sort of thing that can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n187\r\nfly through the air can carry us easily. So I suggest that my friend the Tin\r\nWoodman, who is a skillful mechanic, shall build some sort of a machine,\r\nwith good strong wings, to carry us; and our friend Tip can then bring the\r\nThing to life with his magical powder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo!\" cried Nick Chopper.\r\n\r\n\"What splendid brains!\" murmured Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Really quite clever!\" said the Educated Woggle-Bug.\r\n\r\n\"I believe it can be done,\" declared Tip; \"that is, if the Tin Woodman is\r\nequal to making the Thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do my best,\" said Nick, cheerily; \"and, as a matter of fact, I do not\r\noften fail in what I attempt. But the Thing will have to be built on the\r\nroof of the palace, so it can rise comfortably into the air.\"\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n188\r\n\r\n\"To be sure,\" said the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"Then let us search through the palace,\" continued the Tin Woodman, \"and\r\ncarry all the material we can find to the roof, where I will begin my work.\"\r\n\r\n\"First, however,\" said the Pumpkinhead, \"I beg you will release me from this\r\nhorse, and make me another leg to walk with. For in my present condition I\r\nam of no use to myself or to anyone else.\"\r\n\r\nSo the Tin Woodman knocked a mahogany center-table to pieces with his axe\r\nand fitted one of the legs, which was beautifully carved, on to the body of\r\nJack Pumpkinhead, who was very proud of the acquisition.\r\n\r\n\"It seems strange,\" said he, as he watched the Tin Woodman work, \"that my\r\nleft leg should be the most elegant and substantial part of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"That proves you are unusual,\" returned the Scarecrow. \"and I am convinced\r\nthat the only people worthy of consideration in this world are the unusual\r\nones. For the common folks are like the leaves of a tree, and live and die\r\nunnoticed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spoken like a philosopher!\" cried the Woggle-Bug, as he assisted the Tin\r\nWoodman to set Jack upon his feet.\r\n\r\n\"How do you feel now?\" asked Tip, watching\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n189\r\nthe Pumpkinhead stump around to try his new leg.\"\r\n\r\nAs good as new\" answered Jack, Joyfully, \"and quite ready to assist you all\r\nto escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let us get to work,\" said the Scarecrow, in a business-like tone.\r\n\r\nSo, glad to be doing anything that might lead to the end of their captivity,\r\nthe friends separated to wander over the palace in search of fitting\r\nmaterial to use in the construction of their aerial machine.\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n190               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n191               The Astonishing Flight of the Gump\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the adventurers reassembled upon the roof it was found that a\r\nremarkably queer assortment of articles had been selected by the various\r\nmembers of the party. No one seemed to have a very clear idea of what was\r\nrequired, but all had brought something.\r\n\r\nThe Woggle-Bug had taken from its position over the mantle-piece in the\r\ngreat hallway the head of a Gump, which was adorned with wide-spreading\r\nantlers; and this, with great care and greater difficulty, the insect had\r\ncarried up the stairs to the roof. This Gump resembled an Elk's head, only\r\nthe nose turned upward in a saucy manner and there were whiskers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n192\r\nupon its chin, like those of a billy-goat. Why the Woggle-Bug selected this\r\narticle he could not have explained, except that it had aroused his\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nTip, with the aid of the Saw-Horse, had brought a large, upholstered sofa to\r\nthe roof. It was an oldfashioned piece of furniture, with high back and\r\nends, and it was so heavy that even by resting the greatest weight upon the\r\nback of the Saw-Horse, the boy found himself out of breath when at last the\r\nclumsy sofa was dumped upon the roof.\r\n\r\nThe Pumpkinhead had brought a broom, which was the first thing he saw. The\r\nScarecrow arrived with a coil of clothes-lines and ropes which he had taken\r\nfrom the courtyard, and in his trip up the stairs he had become so entangled\r\nin the loose ends of the ropes that both he and his burden tumbled in a heap\r\nupon the roof and might have rolled off if Tip had not rescued him.\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman appeared last. He also had been to the courtyard, where he\r\nhad cut four great, spreading leaves from a huge palm-tree that was the\r\npride of all the inhabitants of the Emerald City.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Nick!\" exclaimed the Scarecrow, seeing what his friend had done;\r\n\"you have been guilty of the greatest crime any person can commit in the\r\nEmerald City. If I remember rightly, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n193               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n               ALL BROUGHT SOMETHING TO THE ROOF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n194\r\npenalty for chopping leaves from the royal palm-tree is to be killed seven\r\ntimes and afterward imprisoned for life.\"\r\n\r\n\"It cannot be helped now\" answered the Tin Woodman, throwing down the big\r\nleaves upon the roof. \"But it may be one more reason why it is necessary for\r\nus to escape. And now let us see what you have found for me to work with.\"\r\n\r\nMany were the doubtful looks cast upon the heap of miscellaneous material\r\nthat now cluttered the roof, and finally the Scarecrow shook his head and\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n\"Well, if friend Nick can manufacture, from this mess of rubbish, a Thing\r\nthat will fly through the air and carry us to safety, then I will\r\nacknowledge him to be a better mechanic than I suspected.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Tin Woodman seemed at first by no means sure of his powers, and only\r\nafter polishing his forehead vigorously with the chamois-leather did he\r\nresolve to undertake the task.\r\n\r\n\"The first thing required for the machine,\" said he, \"is a body big enough\r\nto carry the entire party. This sofa is the biggest thing we have, and might\r\nbe used for a body. But, should the machine ever tip sideways, we would all\r\nslide off and fall to the ground.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n195\r\n\r\n\"Why not use two sofas?\" asked Tip. \"There's another one just like this down\r\nstairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a very sensible suggestion,\" exclaimed the Tin Woodman. \"You must\r\nfetch the other sofa at once.\"\r\n\r\nSo Tip and the Saw-Horse managed, with much labor, to get the second sofa to\r\nthe roof; and when the two were placed together, edge to edge, the backs and\r\nends formed a protecting rampart all around the seats.\r\n\r\n\"Excellent!\" cried the Scarecrow. \"We can ride within this snug nest quite\r\nat our ease.\"\r\n\r\nThe two sofas were now bound firmly together with ropes and clothes-lines,\r\nand then Nick Chopper fastened the Gump's head to one end.\r\n\r\n\"That will show which is the front end of the Thing,\" said he, greatly\r\npleased with the idea.\" And, really, if you examine it critically, the Gump\r\nlooks very well as a figure-head. These great palm-leaves, for which I have\r\nendangered my life seven times, must serve us as wings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they strong enough?\" asked the boy.\r\n\r\n\"They are as strong as anything we can get,\" answered the Woodman; \"and\r\nalthough they are not in proportion to the Thing's body, we are not in a\r\nposition to be very particular.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n196\r\n\r\nSo he fastened the palm-leaves to the sofas, two on each side.\r\n\r\nSaid the Woggle-Bug, with considerable admiration:\r\n\r\n\"The Thing is now complete, and only needs to be brought to life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop a moment!\" exclaimed Jack.\" Are you not going to use my broom?\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\" asked the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it can be fastened to the back end for a tail,\" answered the\r\nPumpkinhead. \"Surely you would not call the Thing complete without a tail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hm!\" said the Tin Woodman, \"I do not see the use of a tail. We are not\r\ntrying to copy a beast, or a fish, or a bird. All we ask of the Thing is to\r\ncarry us through the air.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps, after the Thing is brought to life, it can use a tail to steer\r\nwith,\" suggested the Scarecrow. \"For if it flies through the air it will not\r\nbe unlike a bird, and I've noticed that all birds have tails, which they use\r\nfor a rudder while flying.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" answered Nick, \"the broom shall be used for a tail,\" and he\r\nfastened it firmly to the back end of the sofa body.\r\n\r\nTip took the pepper-box from his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"The Thing looks very big,\" said he, anxiously;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n197\r\n\"and I am not sure there is enough powder left to bring all of it to life.\r\nBut I'll make it go as far as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Put most on the wings,\" said Nick Chopper; \"for they must be made as strong\r\nas possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"And don't forget the head!\" exclaimed the Woggle-Bug.\r\n\r\n\"Or the tail!\" added Jack Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n\"Do be quiet,\" said Tip, nervously; \"you must give me a chance to work the\r\nmagic charm in the proper manner.\"\r\n\r\nVery carefully he began sprinkling the Thing with the precious powder. Each\r\nof the four wings was first lightly covered with a layer. then the sofas\r\nwere sprinkled, and the broom given a slight coating.\r\n\r\n\"The head! The head! Don't, I beg of you, forget the head!\" cried the\r\nWoggle-Bug, excitedly.\r\n\r\n\"There's only a little of the powder left,\" announced Tip, looking within\r\nthe box.\" And it seems to me it is more important to bring the legs of the\r\nsofas to life than the head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so,\" decided the Scarecrow. \"Every thing must have a head to direct it;\r\nand since this creature is to fly, and not walk, it is really unimportant\r\nwhether its legs are alive or not.\"\r\n\r\nSo Tip abided by this decision and sprinkled the Gump's head with the\r\nremainder of the powder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n198\r\n\r\n\"Now\" said he, \"keep silence while I work the, charm!\"\r\n\r\nHaving heard old Mombi pronounce the magic words, and having also succeeded\r\nin bringing the Saw-Horse to life, Tip did not hesitate an instant in\r\nspeaking the three cabalistic words, each accompanied by the peculiar\r\ngesture of the hands.\r\n\r\nIt was a grave and impressive ceremony.\r\n\r\nAs he finished the incantation the Thing shuddered throughout its huge bulk,\r\nthe Gump gave the screeching cry that is familiar to those animals, and then\r\nthe four wings began flopping furiously.\r\n\r\nTip managed to grasp a chimney, else he would have been blown off the roof\r\nby the terrible breeze raised by the wings. The Scarecrow, being light in\r\nweight, was caught up bodily and borne through the air until Tip luckily\r\nseized him by one leg and held him fast. The Woggle-Bug lay flat upon the\r\nroof and so escaped harm,\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n199\r\nand the Tin Woodman, whose weight of tin anchored him firmly, threw both\r\narms around Jack Pumpkinhead and managed to save him. The Saw-Horse toppled\r\nover upon his back and lay with his legs waving helplessly above him.\r\n\r\nAnd now, while all were struggling to recover themselves, the Thing rose\r\nslowly from the roof and mounted into the air.\r\n\r\n\"Here! Come back!\" cried Tip, in a frightened voice, as he clung to the\r\nchimney with one hand and the Scarecrow with the other. \"Come back at once,\r\nI command you!\"\r\n\r\nIt was now that the wisdom of the Scarecrow, in bringing the head of the\r\nThing to life instead of the legs, was proved beyond a doubt. For the Gump,\r\nalready high in the air, turned its head at Tip's command and gradually\r\ncircled around until it could view the roof of the palace.\r\n\r\n\"Come back!\" shouted the boy, again.\r\n\r\nAnd the Gump obeyed, slowly and gracefully waving its four wings in the air\r\nuntil the Thing had settled once more upon the roof and become still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n200               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n201               In the Jackdaw's Nest\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This,\" said the Gump, in a squeaky voice not at all proportioned to the\r\nsize of its great body, \"is the most novel experience I ever heard of. The\r\nlast thing I remember distinctly is walking through the forest and hearing a\r\nloud noise. Something probably killed me then, and it certainly ought to\r\nhave been the end of me. Yet here I am, alive again, with four monstrous\r\nwings and a body which I venture to say would make any respectable animal or\r\nfowl weep with shame to own. What does it all mean? Am I a Gump, or am I a\r\njuggernaut?\" The creature, as it spoke, wiggled its chin whiskers in a very\r\ncomical manner.\r\n\r\n\"You're just a Thing,\" answered Tip, \"with a Gump's head on it. And we have\r\nmade you and brought you to life so that you may carry us through the air\r\nwherever we wish to go.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n202\r\n\r\n\"Very good!\" said the Thing. \"As I am not a Gump, I cannot have a Gump's\r\npride or independent spirit. So I may as well become your servant as\r\nanything else. My only satisfaction is that I do not seem to have a very\r\nstrong constitution, and am not likely to live long in a state of slavery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't say that, I beg of you!\" cried the Tin Woodman, whose excellent heart\r\nwas strongly affected by this sad speech.\" Are you not feeling well today?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, as for that,\" returned the Gump, \"it is my first day of existence; so I\r\ncannot Judge whether I am feeling well or ill.\" And it waved its broom tail\r\nto and fro in a pensive manner.\r\n\r\n\"Come, come!\" said the Scarecrow, kindly. \"do try, to be more cheerful and\r\ntake life as you find it. We shall be kind masters, and will strive to\r\nrender your existence as pleasant as possible. Are you willing to carry us\r\nthrough the air wherever we wish to go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" answered the Gump. \"I greatly prefer to navigate the air. For\r\nshould I travel on the earth and meet with one of my own species, my\r\nembarrassment would be something awful!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can appreciate that,\" said the Tin Woodman, sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" continued the Thing, \"when I carefully\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n203\r\nlook you over, my masters, none of you seems to be constructed much more\r\nartistically than I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Appearances are deceitful,\" said the Woggle-Bug, earnestly. \"I am both\r\nHighly Magnified and Thoroughly Educated.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" murmured the Gump, indifferently.\r\n\r\n\"And my brains are considered remarkably rare specimens,\" added the\r\nScarecrow, proudly.\r\n\r\n\"How strange!\" remarked the Gump.\r\n\r\n\"Although I am of tin,\" said the Woodman, \"I own a heart altogether the\r\nwarmest and most admirable in the whole world.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm delighted to hear it,\" replied the Gump, with a slight cough.\r\n\r\n\"My smile,\" said Jack Pumpkinhead, \"is worthy your best attention. It is\r\nalways the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"Semper idem,\" explained the Woggle-Bug, pompously; and the Gump turned to\r\nstare at him.\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" declared the Saw-Horse, filling in an awkward pause, \"am only\r\nremarkable because I can't help it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am proud, indeed, to meet with such exceptional masters,\" said the Gump,\r\nin a careless tone. \"If I could but secure so complete an introduction to\r\nmyself, I would be more than satisfied.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will come in time,\" remarked the Scare-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n204\r\ncrow. \"To 'Know Thyself' is considered quite an accomplishment, which it has\r\ntaken us, who are your elders, months to perfect. But now,\" he added,\r\nturning to the others, \"let us get aboard and start upon our journey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where shall we go?\" asked Tip, as he clambered to a seat on the sofas and\r\nassisted the Pumpkinhead to follow him.\r\n\r\n\"In the South Country rules a very delightful Queen called Glinda the Good,\r\nwho I am sure will gladly receive us,\" said the Scarecrow, getting into the\r\nThing clumsily. \"Let us go to her and ask her advice.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is cleverly thought of,\" declared Nick Chopper, giving the Woggle-Bug\r\na boost and then toppling the Saw-Horse into the rear end of the cushioned\r\nseats.\" I know Glinda the Good, and believe she will prove a friend indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we all ready?\" asked the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" announced the Tin Woodman, seating himself beside the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Tip, addressing the Gump, \"be kind enough to fly with us to the\r\nSouthward; and do not go higher than to escape the houses and trees, for it\r\nmakes me dizzy to be up so far.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" answered the Gump, briefly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n205\r\n\r\nIt flopped its four huge wings and rose slowly into the air; and then, while\r\nour little band of adventurers clung to the backs and sides of the sofas for\r\nsupport, the Gump turned toward the South and soared swiftly and\r\nmajestically away.\r\n\r\n\"The scenic effect, from this altitude, is marvelous,\" commented the\r\neducated Woggle-Bug, as they rode along.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind the scenery,\" said the Scarecrow. \"Hold on tight, or you may get\r\na tumble. The Thing seems to rock badly.'\r\n\r\n\"It will be dark soon,\" said Tip, observing that the sun was low on the\r\nhorizon. \"Perhaps we should have waited until morning. I wonder if the Gump\r\ncan fly in the night.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been wondering that myself,\" returned the Gump quietly. \"You see, this\r\nis a new experience to me. I used to have legs that carried me swiftly over\r\nthe ground. But now my legs feel as if they were asleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are,\" said Tip. \"We didn't bring 'em to life.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're expected to fly,\" explained the Scarecrow. \"not to walk.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can walk ourselves,\" said the Woggle-Bug.\"\r\n\r\nI begin to understand what is required of me,\" remarked the Gump; \"so I will\r\ndo my best to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n206\r\nplease you,\" and he flew on for a time in silence.\r\n\r\nPresently Jack Pumpkinhead became uneasy.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if riding through the air is liable to spoil pumpkins,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Not unless you carelessly drop your head over the side,\" answered the\r\nWoggle-Bug. \"In that event your head would no longer be a pumpkin, for it\r\nwould become a squash.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I not asked you to restrain these unfeeling jokes?\" demanded Tip,\r\nlooking at the Woggle-Bug with a severe expression.\r\n\r\n\"You have; and I've restrained a good many of them,\" replied the insect.\r\n\"But there are opportunities for so many excellent puns in our language\r\nthat, to an educated person like myself, the temptation to express them is\r\nalmost irresistible.\"\r\n\r\n\"People with more or less education discovered those puns centuries ago,\"\r\nsaid Tip.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure?\" asked the Woggle-Bug, with a startled look.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I am,\" answered the boy. \"An educated Woggle-Bug may be a new\r\nthing; but a Woggle-Bug education is as old as the hills, judging from the\r\ndisplay you make of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe insect seemed much impressed by this remark, and for a time maintained a\r\nmeek silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n207\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow, in shifting his seat, saw upon the cushions the pepper-box\r\nwhich Tip had cast aside, and began to examine it.\r\n\r\n\"Throw it overboard,\" said the boy; \"it's quite empty now, and there's no\r\nuse keeping it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it really empty?\" asked the Scarecrow, looking curiously into the box.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it is,\" answered Tip. \"I shook out every grain of the powder.\r\n\r\n\"Then the box has two bottoms,\" announced the Scarecrow, \"for the bottom on\r\nthe inside is fully an inch away from the bottom on the outside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me see,\" said the Tin Woodman, taking the box from his friend. \"Yes,\"\r\nhe declared, after looking it over, \"the thing certainly has a false bottom.\r\nNow, I wonder what that is for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you get it apart, and find out?\" enquired Tip, now quite interested\r\nin the mystery.\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes; the lower bottom unscrews,\" said the Tin Woodman. \"My fingers are\r\nrather stiff; please see if you can open it.\"\r\n\r\nHe handed the pepper-box to Tip, who had no difficulty in unscrewing the\r\nbottom. And in the cavity below were three silver pills, with a carefully\r\nfolded paper lying underneath them.\r\n\r\nThis paper the boy proceeded to unfold, taking\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n208\r\ncare not to spill the pills, and found several lines clearly written in red\r\nink.\r\n\r\n\"Read it aloud,\" said the Scarecrow. so Tip read, as follows:\r\n\r\n          \"DR. NIKIDIK'S CELEBRATED WISHING PILLS.\r\n\r\n\"Directions for Use: Swallow one pill; count seventeen by twos; then make a\r\nWish.\r\n-The Wish will immediately be granted.\r\n               CAUTION: Keep in a Dry and Dark Place.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why, this is a very valuable discovery!\" cried the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"It is, indeed,\" replied Tip, gravely. \"These pills may be of great use to\r\nus. I wonder if old Mombi knew they were in the bottom of the pepper-box. I\r\nremember hearing her say that she got the Powder of Life from this same\r\nNikidik.\"\r\n\r\n\"He must be a powerful Sorcerer!\" exclaimed the Tin Woodman; \"and since the\r\npowder proved a success we ought to have confidence in the pills.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how,\" asked the Scarecrow, \"can anyone count seventeen by twos?\r\nSeventeen is an odd number.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" replied Tip, greatly disappointed. \"No one can possibly\r\ncount seventeen by twos.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the pills are of no use to us,\" wailed the Pumpkinhead; \"and this fact\r\noverwhelms me with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n209\r\ngrief. For I had intended wishing that my head would never spoil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" said the Scarecrow, sharply. \"If we could use the pills at all\r\nwe would make far better wishes than that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not see how anything could be better,\" protested poor Jack. \"If you\r\nwere liable to spoil at any time you could understand my anxiety.\"\r\n\r\n\"For my part,\" said the Tin Woodman, \"I sympathize with you in every\r\nrespect. But since we cannot count seventeen by twos, sympathy is all you\r\nare liable to get.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time it had become quite dark, and the voyagers found above them a\r\ncloudy sky, through which the rays of the moon could not penetrate.\r\n\r\nThe Gump flew steadily on, and for some reason the huge sofa-body rocked\r\nmore and more dizzily every hour.\r\n\r\nThe Woggle-Bug declared he was sea-sick; and Tip was also pale and somewhat\r\ndistressed. But the others clung to the backs of the sofas and did not seem\r\nto mind the motion as long as they were not tipped out.\r\n\r\nDarker and darker grew the night, and on and on sped the Gump through the\r\nblack heavens. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n210\r\ntravelers could not even see one another, and an oppressive silence settled\r\ndown upon them.\r\n\r\nAfter a long time Tip, who had been thinking deeply, spoke.\r\n\r\n\"How are we to know when we come to the pallace of Glinda the Good?\" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"It's a long way to Glinda's palace,\" answered the Woodman; \"I've traveled\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how are we to know how fast the Gump is flying?\" persisted the boy. \"We\r\ncannot see a single thing down on the earth, and before morning we may be\r\nfar beyond the place we want to reach.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all true enough,\" the Scarecrow replied, a little uneasily. \"But I\r\ndo not see how we can stop just now; for we might alight in a river, or on,\r\nthe top of a steeple; and that would be a great disaster.\"\r\n\r\nSo they permitted the Gump to fly on, with regular flops of its great wings,\r\nand waited patiently for morning.\r\n\r\nThen Tip's fears were proven to be well founded; for with the first streaks\r\nof gray dawn they looked over the sides of the sofas and discovered rolling\r\nplains dotted with queer villages, where the houses, instead of being dome-\r\nshaped--as they all are in the Land of Oz--had slanting roofs that rose\r\nto a peak\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n211\r\nin the center. Odd looking animals were also moving about upon the open\r\nplains, and the country was unfamiliar to both the Tin Woodman and the\r\nScarecrow, who had formerly visited Glinda the Good's domain and knew it\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\"We are lost!\" said the Scarecrow, dolefully. \"The Gump must have carried us\r\nentirely out of the Land of Oz and over the sandy deserts and into the\r\nterrible outside world that Dorothy told us about.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must get back,\" exclaimed the Tin Woodman, earnestly. \"we must get back\r\nas soon as possible!\"\r\n\r\n\"Turn around!\" cried Tip to the Gump. \"turn as quickly as you can!\"\r\n\r\n\"If I do I shall upset,\" answered the Gump. \"I'm not at all used to flying,\r\nand the best plan would be for me to alight in some place, and then I can\r\nturn around and take a fresh start.\"\r\n\r\nJust then, however, there seemed to be no stopping-place that would answer\r\ntheir purpose. They flew over a village so big that the Woggle-Bug declared\r\nit was a city. and then they came to a range of high mountains with many\r\ndeep gorges and steep cliffs showing plainly.\r\n\r\n\"Now is our chance to stop,\" said the boy, finding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n212\r\nthey were very close to the mountain tops. Then he turned to the Gump and\r\ncommanded: \"Stop at the first level place you see!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" answered the Gump, and settled down upon a table of rock that\r\nstood between two cliffs.\r\n\r\nBut not being experienced in such matters, the Gump did not judge his speed\r\ncorrectly; and instead of coming to a stop upon the flat rock he missed it\r\nby half the width of his body, breaking off both his right wings against the\r\nsharp edge of the rock and then tumbling over and over down the cliff.\r\n\r\nOur friends held on to the sofas as long as they could, but when the Gump\r\ncaught on a proJecting rock the Thing stopped suddenly--bottom side up--and\r\nall were immediately dumped out.\r\n\r\nBy good fortune they fell only a few feet; for underneath them was a monster\r\nnest, built by a colony of Jackdaws in a hollow ledge of rock; so none of\r\nthem--not even the Pumpkinhead--was injured by the fall. For Jack found\r\nhis precious head resting on the soft breast of the Scarecrow, which made an\r\nexcellent cushion; and Tip fell on a mass of leaves and papers, which saved\r\nhim from injury. The Woggle-Bug had bumped his round head against\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n213               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n               ALL WERE IMMEDIATELY DUMPED OUT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n214\r\nthe Saw-Horse, but without causing him more than a moment's inconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman was at first much alarmed; but finding he had escaped\r\nwithout even a scratch upon his beautiful nickle-plate he at once regained\r\nhis accustomed cheerfulness and turned to address his comrades.\r\n\r\n\"Our Journey had ended rather suddenly,\" said he; \"and we cannot justly\r\nblame our friend the Gump for our accident, because he did the best he could\r\nunder the circumstances. But how we are ever to escape from this nest I must\r\nleave to someone with better brains than I possess.\"\r\n\r\nHere he gazed at the Scarecrow; who crawled to the edge of the nest and\r\nlooked over. Below them was a sheer precipice several hundred feet in depth.\r\nAbove them was a smooth cliff unbroken save by the point of rock where the\r\nwrecked body of the Gump still hung suspended from the end of one of the\r\nsofas. There really seemed to be no means of escape, and as they realized\r\ntheir helpless plight the little band of adventurers gave way to their\r\nbewilderment.\r\n\r\n\"This is a worse prison than the palace,\" sadly remarked the Woggle-Bug.\r\n\r\n\"I wish we had stayed there,\" moaned Jack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n215\r\n\"I'm afraid the mountain air isn't good for pumpkins.\"\r\n\r\n\"It won't be when the Jackdaws come back,\" growled the Saw-Horse, which lay\r\nwaving its legs in a vain endeavor to get upon its feet again. \"Jackdaws are\r\nespecially fond of pumpkins.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think the birds will come here?\" asked Jack, much distressed.\r\n\r\n\"Of course they will,\" said Tip; \"for this is their nest. And there must be\r\nhundreds of them,\" he continued, \"for see what a lot of things they have\r\nbrought here!\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, the nest was half filled with a most curious collection of small\r\narticles for which the birds could have no use, but which the thieving\r\nJackdaws had stolen during many years from the homes of men. And as the nest\r\nwas safely hidden where no human being could reach it, this lost property\r\nwould never be recovered.\r\n\r\nThe Woggle-Bug, searching among the rubbish--for the Jackdaws stole\r\nuseless things as well as valuable ones--turned up with his foot a\r\nbeautiful diamond necklace. This was so greatly admired by the Tin Woodman\r\nthat the Woggle-Bug presented it to him with a graceful speech, after which\r\nthe Woodman hung it around his neck with much pride,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n216               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n               TURNED UP A BEAUTIFUL DIAMOND NECKLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n217\r\nrejoicing exceedingly when the big diamonds glittered in the sun's rays.\r\n\r\nBut now they heard a great jabbering and flopping of wings, and as the sound\r\ngrew nearer to them Tip exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"The Jackdaws are coming! And if they find us here they will surely kill us\r\nin their anger.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was afraid of this!\" moaned the Pumpkinhead. \"My time has come!\"\r\n\r\n\"And mine, also!\" said the Woggle-Bug; \"for Jackdaws are the greatest\r\nenemies of my race.\"\r\n\r\nThe others were not at all afraid; but the Scarecrow at once decided to save\r\nthose of the party who were liable to be injured by the angry birds. So he\r\ncommanded Tip to take off Jack's head and lie down with it in the bottom of\r\nthe nest, and when this was done he ordered the Woggle-Bug to lie beside\r\nTip. Nick Chopper, who knew from past experience Just what to do, then took\r\nthe Scarecrow to pieces (all except his head) and scattered the straw over\r\nTip and the Woggle-Bug, completely covering their bodies.\r\n\r\nHardly had this been accomplished when the flock of Jackdaws reached them.\r\nPerceiving the intruders in their nest the birds flew down upon them with\r\nscreams of rage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n218               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n219               Dr. Nikidik's Famous Wishing Pills\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman was usually a peaceful man, but when occasion required he\r\ncould fight as fiercely as a Roman gladiator. So, when the Jackdaws nearly\r\nknocked him down in their rush of wings, and their sharp beaks and claws\r\nthreatened to damage his brilliant plating, the Woodman picked up his axe\r\nand made it whirl swiftly around his head.\r\n\r\nBut although many were beaten off in this way, the birds were so numerous\r\nand so brave that they continued the attack as furiously as before. Some of\r\nthem pecked at the eyes of the Gump, which hung over the nest in a helpless\r\ncondition; but the Gump's eyes were of glass and could not be injured.\r\nOthers of the Jackdaws rushed at the Saw-Horse; but that animal, being still\r\nupon his back, kicked out so viciously with his wooden legs that he beat off\r\nas many assailants as did the Woodman's axe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n220\r\n\r\nFinding themselves thus opposed, the birds fell upon the Scarecrow's straw,\r\nwhich lay at the center of the nest, covering Tip and the Woggle-Bug and\r\nJack's pumpkin head, and began tearing it away and flying off with it, only\r\nto let it drop, straw by straw into the great gulf beneath.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow's head, noting with dismay this wanton destruction of his\r\ninterior, cried to the Tin Woodman to save him; and that good friend\r\nresponded with renewed energy. His axe fairly flashed among the Jackdaws,\r\nand fortunately the Gump began wildly waving the two wings remaining on the\r\nleft side of its body. The flutter of these great wings filled the Jackdaws\r\nwith terror, and when the Gump by its exertions freed itself from the peg of\r\nrock on which it hung, and sank flopping into the nest, the alarm of the\r\nbirds knew no bounds and they fled screaming over the mountains.\r\n\r\nWhen the last foe had disappeared, Tip crawled from under the sofas and\r\nassisted the Woggle-Bug to follow him.\r\n\r\n\"We are saved!\" shouted the boy, delightedly.\r\n\r\n\"We are, indeed!\" responded the Educated Insect, fairly hugging the stiff\r\nhead of the Gump in his joy. \"and we owe it all to the flopping of the\r\nThing, and the good axe of the Woodman!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n221\r\n\r\n\"If I am saved, get me out of here!\" called Jack; whose head was still\r\nbeneath the sofas; and Tip managed to roll the pumpkin out and place it upon\r\nits neck again. He also set the Saw-Horse upright, and said to it:\r\n\r\n\"We owe you many thanks for the gallant fight you made.\"\r\n\r\n\"I really think we have escaped very nicely,\" remarked the Tin Woodman, in a\r\ntone of pride.\r\n\r\n\"Not so!\" exclaimed a hollow voice.\r\n\r\nAt this they all turned in surprise to look at the Scarecrow's head, which\r\nlay at the back of the nest.\r\n\r\n\"I am completely ruined!\" declared the Scarecrow, as he noted their\r\nastonishment. \"For where is the straw that stuffs my body?\"\r\n\r\nThe awful question startled them all. They gazed around the nest with\r\nhorror, for not a vestige of straw remained. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n222\r\nJackdaws had stolen it to the last wisp and flung it all into the chasm that\r\nyawned for hundreds of feet beneath the nest.\r\n\r\n\"My poor, poor friend!\" said the Tin Woodman, taking up the Scarecrow's head\r\nand caressing it tenderly; \"whoever could imagine you would come to this\r\nuntimely end?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did it to save my friends,\" returned the head; \"and I am glad that I\r\nperished in so noble and unselfish a manner.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why are you all so despondent?\" inquired the Woggle-Bug. \"The\r\nScarecrow's clothing is still safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered the Tin Woodman; \"but our friend's clothes are useless\r\nwithout stuffing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not stuff him with money?\" asked Tip.\r\n\r\n\"Money!\" they all cried, in an amazed chorus.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure,\" said the boy. \"In the bottom of the nest are thousands of\r\ndollar bills--and two-dollar bills--and five-dollar bills--and tens,\r\nand twenties, and fifties. There are enough of them to stuff a dozen\r\nScarecrows. Why not use the money?\"\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman began to turn over the rubbish with the handle of his axe;\r\nand, sure enough, what they had first thought only worthless papers were\r\nfound to be all bills of various denominations,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n223\r\nwhich the mischievous Jackdaws had for years been engaged in stealing from\r\nthe villages and cities they visited.\r\n\r\nThere was an immense fortune lying in that inaccessible nest; and Tip's\r\nsuggestion was, with the Scarecrow's consent, quickly acted upon.\r\n\r\nThey selected all the newest and cleanest bills and assorted them into\r\nvarious piles. The Scarecrow's left leg and boot were stuffed with five-\r\ndollar bills; his right leg was stuffed with ten-dollar bills, and his body\r\nso closely filled with fifties, one-hundreds and one-thousands that he could\r\nscarcely button his jacket with comfort.\r\n\r\n\"You are now\" said the Woggle-Bug, impressively, when the task had been\r\ncompleted, \"the most valuable member of our party; and as you\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n224\r\nare among faithful friends there is little danger of your being spent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" returned the Scarecrow, gratefully. \"I feel like a new man; and\r\nalthough at first glance I might be mistaken for a Safety Deposit Vault, I\r\nbeg you to remember that my Brains are still composed of the same old\r\nmaterial. And these are the possessions that have always made me a person to\r\nbe depended upon in an emergency.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the emergency is here,\" observed Tip; \"and unless your brains help us\r\nout of it we shall be compelled to pass the remainder of our lives in this\r\nnest.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about these wishing pills?\" enquired the Scarecrow, taking the box from\r\nhis jacket pocket. \"Can't we use them to escape?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not unless we can count seventeen by twos,\" answered the Tin Woodman. \"But\r\nour friend the Woggle-Bug claims to be highly educated, so he ought easily\r\nto figure out how that can be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't a question of education,\" returned the Insect; \"it's merely a\r\nquestion of mathematics. I've seen the professor work lots of sums on the\r\nblackboard, and he claimed anything could be done with x's and y's and a's,\r\nand such things, by mixing them up with plenty of plusses and minuses and\r\nequals, and so forth. But he never said anything, so far as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n225\r\nI can remember, about counting up to the odd number of seventeen by the even\r\nnumbers of twos.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop! stop!\" cried the Pumpkinhead. \"You're making my head ache.\"\r\n\r\n\"And mine,\" added the Scarecrow. \"Your mathematics seem to me very like a\r\nbottle of mixed pickles the more you fish for what you want the less chance\r\nyou have of getting it. I am certain that if the thing can be accomplished\r\nat all, it is in a very simple manner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Tip. \"old Mombi couldn't use x's and minuses, for she never went\r\nto school.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not start counting at a half of one?\" asked the Saw-Horse, abruptly.\r\n\"Then anyone can count up to seventeen by twos very easily.\"\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other in surprise, for the Saw-Horse was considered the\r\nmost stupid of the entire party.\r\n\r\n\"You make me quite ashamed of myself,\" said the Scarecrow, bowing low to the\r\nSaw-Horse.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, the creature is right,\" declared the Woggle-Bug; for twice\r\none-half is one, and if you get to one it is easy to count from one up to\r\nseventeen by twos.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder I didn't think of that myself,\" said the Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n226\r\n\r\n\"I don't,\" returned the Scarecrow. \"You're no wiser than the rest of us, are\r\nyou? But let us make a wish at once. Who will swallow the first pill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you do it,\" suggested Tip.\r\n\r\n\"I can't,\" said the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"Why not? You've a mouth, haven't you?\" asked the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but my mouth is painted on, and there's no swallow connected with it,'\r\nanswered the Scarecrow. \"In fact,\" he continued, looking from one to another\r\ncritically, \"I believe the boy and the Woggle-Bug are the only ones in our\r\nparty that are able to swallow.\"\r\n\r\nObserving the truth of this remark, Tip said:\r\n\r\n\"Then I will undertake to make the first wish. Give me one of the Silver\r\nPills.\"\r\n\r\nThis the Scarecrow tried to do; but his padded gloves were too clumsy to\r\nclutch so small an object, and he held the box toward the boy while Tip\r\nselected one of the pills and swallowed it.\r\n\r\n\"Count!\" cried the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"One-half, one, three, five, seven, nine, eleven,!\" counted Tip. thirteen,\r\nfifteen, seventeen.\r\n\r\n\"Now wish!\" said the Tin Woodman anxiously:\r\n\r\nBut Just then the boy began to suffer such fearful pains that he became\r\nalarmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n227\r\n\r\n\"The pill has poisoned me!\" he gasped; \"O--h! O-o-o-o-o! Ouch! Murder!\r\nFire! O-o-h!\" and here he rolled upon the bottom of the nest in such\r\ncontortions that he frightened them all.\r\n\r\n\"What can we do for you. Speak, I beg!\" entreated the Tin Woodman, tears of\r\nsympathy running down his nickel cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"I--I don't know!\" answered Tip. \"O--h! I wish I'd never swallowed that\r\npill!\"\r\n\r\nThen at once the pain stopped, and the boy rose to his feet again and found\r\nthe Scarecrow looking with amazement at the end of the pepper-box.\r\n\r\n\"What's happened?\" asked the boy, a little ashamed of his recent exhibition.\r\n\r\n\"Why, the three pills are in the box again!\" said the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"Of course they are,\" the Woggle-Bug declared. \"Didn't Tip wish that he'd\r\nnever swallowed one of them? Well, the wish came true, and he didn't swallow\r\none of them. So of course they are all three in the box.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be; but the pill gave me a dreadful pain, just the same,\" said the\r\nboy.\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\" declared the Woggle-\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n228\r\nBug. \"If you have never swallowed it, the pill can not have given you a\r\npain. And as your wish, being granted, proves you did not swallow the pill,\r\nit is also plain that you suffered no pain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it was a splendid imitation of a pain,\" retorted Tip, angrily.\r\n\"Suppose you try the next pill yourself. We've wasted one wish already.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, we haven't!\" protested the Scarecrow. \"Here are still three pills\r\nin the box, and each pill is good for a wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now you're making my head ache,\" said Tip. \"I can't understand the thing at\r\nall. But I won't take another pill, I promise you!\" and with this remark he\r\nretired sulkily to the back of the nest.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the Woggle-Bug, \"it remains for me to save us in my most Highly\r\nMagnified and Thoroughly Educated manner; for I seem to be the only one able\r\nand willing to make a wish. Let me have one of the pills.\"\r\n\r\nHe swallowed it without hesitation, and they all stood admiring his courage\r\nwhile the Insect counted seventeen by twos in the same way that Tip had\r\ndone. And for some reason--perhaps because Woggle-Bugs have stronger\r\nstomachs than boys--the silver pellet caused it no pain whatever.\r\n\r\n\"I wish the Gump's broken wings mended, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n229\r\nas good as new!\" said the Woggle-Bug, in a slow; impressive voice.\r\n\r\nAll turned to look at the Thing, and so quickly had the wish been granted\r\nthat the Gump lay before them in perfect repair, and as well able to fly\r\nthrough the air as when it had first been brought to life on the roof of the\r\npalace.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n230               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n231               The Scarecrow Appeals to Glinda the Good\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Hooray!\" shouted the Scarecrow, gaily. \"We can now leave this miserable\r\nJackdaws' nest whenever we please.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is nearly dark,\" said the Tin Woodman; \"and unless we wait until\r\nmorning to make our flight we may get into more trouble. I don't like these\r\nnight trips, for one never knows what will happen.\"\r\n\r\nSo it was decided to wait until daylight, and the adventurers amused\r\nthemselves in the twilight by searching the Jackdaws' nest for treasures.\r\n\r\nThe Woggle-Bug found two handsome bracelets of wrought gold, which fitted\r\nhis slender arms very well. The Scarecrow took a fancy for rings, of which\r\nthere were many in the nest. Before long he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n232\r\nhad fitted a ring to each finger of his padded gloves, and not being content\r\nwith that display he added one more to each thumb. As he carefully chose\r\nthose rings set with sparkling stones, such as rubies, amethysts and\r\nsapphires, the Scarecrow's hands now presented a most brilliant appearance.\r\n\r\n\"This nest would be a picnic for Queen Jinjur,\" said he, musingly. \"for as\r\nnearly as I can make out she and her girls conquered me merely to rob my\r\ncity of its emeralds.\"\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman was content with his diamond necklace and refused to accept\r\nany additional decorations; but Tip secured a fine gold watch, which was\r\nattached to a heavy fob, and placed it in his pocket with much pride. He\r\nalso pinned several jeweled brooches to Jack Pumpkinhead's red waistcoat,\r\nand attached a lorgnette, by means of a fine chain, to the neck of the\r\nSaw-Horse.\r\n\r\n\"It's very pretty,\" said the creature, regarding the lorgnette approvingly;\r\n\"but what is it for?\"\r\n\r\nNone of them could answer that question, however; so the Saw-Horse decided\r\nit was some rare decoration and became very fond of it.\r\n\r\nThat none of the party might be slighted, they ended by placing several\r\nlarge seal rings upon the points of the Gump's antlers, although that odd\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n233\r\npersonage seemed by no means gratified by the attention.\r\n\r\nDarkness soon fell upon them, and Tip and the Woggle-Bug went to sleep while\r\nthe others sat down to wait patiently for the day.\r\n\r\nNext morning they had cause to congratulate themselves upon the useful\r\ncondition of the Gump; for with daylight a great flock of Jackdaws\r\napproached to engage in one more battle for the possession of the nest.\r\n\r\nBut our adventurers did not wait for the assault. They tumbled into the\r\ncushioned seats of the sofas as quickly as possible, and Tip gave the word\r\nto the Gump to start.\r\n\r\nAt once it rose into the air, the great wings flopping strongly and with\r\nregular motions, and in a few moments they were so far from the nest that\r\nthe chattering Jackdaws took possession without any attempt at pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe Thing flew due North, going in the same direction from whence it had\r\ncome. At least, that was the Scarecrow's opinion, and the others agreed that\r\nthe Scarecrow was the best judge of direction. After passing over several\r\ncities and villages the Gump carried them high above a broad plain where\r\nhouses became more and more scattered until they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n234\r\ndisappeared altogether. Next came the wide, sandy desert separating the rest\r\nof the world from the Land of Oz, and before noon they saw the dome-shaped\r\nhouses that proved they were once more within the borders of their native\r\nland.\r\n\r\n\"But the houses and fences are blue,\" said the Tin Woodman, \"and that\r\nindicates we are in the land of the Munchkins, and therefore a long distance\r\nfrom Glinda the Good.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do?\" asked the boy, turning to their guide.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know\" replied the Scarecrow, frankly. \"If we were at the Emerald\r\nCity we could then move directly southward, and so reach our destination.\r\nBut we dare not go to the Emerald City, and the Gump is probably carrying us\r\nfurther in the wrong direction with every flop of its wings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the Woggle-Bug must swallow another pill,\" said Tip, decidedly, \"and\r\nwish us headed in the right direction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" returned the Highly Magnified one; \"I'm willing.\"\r\n\r\nBut when the Scarecrow searched in his pocket for the pepper-box containing\r\nthe two silver Wishing Pills, it was not to be found. Filled with anxiety,\r\nthe voyagers hunted throughout every inch of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n235\r\nThing for the precious box; but it had disappeared entirely.\r\n\r\nAnd still the Gump flew onward, carrying them they knew not where.\r\n\r\n\"I must have left the pepper-box in the Jackdaws' nest,\" said the Scarecrow,\r\nat length.\r\n\r\n\"It is a great misfortune,\" the Tin Woodman declared. \"But we are no worse\r\noff than before we discovered the Wishing Pills.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are better off,\" replied Tip. \"for the one pill we used has enabled us\r\nto escape from that horrible nest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet the loss of the other two is serious, and I deserve a good scolding for\r\nmy carelessness,\" the Scarecrow rejoined, penitently. \"For in such an\r\nunusual party as this accidents are liable to happen any moment, and even\r\nnow we may be approaching a new danger.\"\r\n\r\nNo one dared contradict this, and a dismal silence ensued.\r\n\r\nThe Gump flew steadily on.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Tip uttered an exclamation of surprise. \"We must have reached the\r\nSouth Country,\" he cried, \"for below us everything is red!\"\r\n\r\nImmediately they all leaned over the backs of the sofas to look--all\r\nexcept Jack, who was too careful\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n236\r\nof his pumpkin head to risk its slipping off his neck. Sure enough; the red\r\nhouses and fences and trees indicated they were within the domain of Glinda\r\nthe Good; and presently, as they glided rapidly on, the Tin Woodman\r\nrecognized the roads and buildings they passed, and altered slightly the\r\nflight of\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n237\r\nthe Gump so that they might reach the palace of the celebrated Sorceress.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" cried the Scarecrow, delightedly. \"We do not need the lost Wishing\r\nPills now, for we have arrived at our destination.\"\r\n\r\nGradually the Thing sank lower and nearer to the ground until at length it\r\ncame to rest within the beautiful gardens of Glinda, settling upon a velvety\r\ngreen lawn close by a fountain which sent sprays of flashing gems, instead\r\nof water, high into the air, whence they fell with a soft, tinkling sound\r\ninto the carved marble basin placed to receive them.\r\n\r\nEverything was very gorgeous in Glinda's gardens, and while our voyagers\r\ngazed about with admiring eyes a company of soldiers silently appeared and\r\nsurrounded them. But these soldiers of the great Sorceress were entirely\r\ndifferent from those of Jinjur's Army of Revolt, although they were likewise\r\ngirls. For Glinda's soldiers wore neat uniforms and bore swords and spears;\r\nand they marched with a skill and precision that proved them well trained in\r\nthe arts of war.\r\n\r\nThe Captain commanding this troop--which was Glinda's private Body\r\nGuard--recognized the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman at once, and greeted them\r\nwith respectful salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n238\r\n\r\n\"Good day!\" said the Scarecrow, gallantly removing his hat, while the\r\nWoodman gave a soldierly salute; \"we have come to request an audience with\r\nyour fair Ruler.\"\r\n\r\n\"Glinda is now within her palace, awaiting you,\" returned the Captain; \"for\r\nshe saw you coming long before you arrived.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is strange!\" said Tip, wondering.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" answered the Scarecrow, \"for Glinda the Good is a mighty\r\nSorceress, and nothing that goes on in the Land of Oz escapes her notice. I\r\nsuppose she knows why we came as well as we do ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what was the use of our coming?\" asked Jack, stupidly.\r\n\r\n\"To prove you are a Pumpkinhead!\" retorted the Scarecrow. \"But, if the\r\nSorceress expects us, we must not keep her waiting.\"\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n239\r\n\r\nSo they all clambered out of the sofas and followed the Captain toward the\r\npalace--even the Saw-Horse taking his place in the queer procession.\r\n\r\nUpon her throne of finely wrought gold sat Glinda, and she could scarcely\r\nrepress a smile as her peculiar visitors entered and bowed before her. Both\r\nthe Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman she knew and liked; but the awkward\r\nPumpkinhead and Highly Magnified Woggle-Bug were creatures she had never\r\nseen before, and they seemed even more curious than the others. As for the\r\nSaw-Horse, he looked to be nothing more than an animated chunk of wood; and\r\nhe bowed so stiffly that his head bumped against the floor, causing a ripple\r\nof laughter among the soldiers, in which Glinda frankly joined.\r\n\r\n\"I beg to announce to your glorious highness,\" began the Scarecrow, in a\r\nsolemn voice, \"that my Emerald City has been overrun by a crowd of impudent\r\ngirls with knitting-needles, who have enslaved all the men, robbed the\r\nstreets and public buildings of all their emerald jewels, and usurped my\r\nthrone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it,\" said Glinda.\r\n\r\n\"They also threatened to destroy me, as well as all the good friends and\r\nallies you see before you,\" continued the Scarecrow. \"and had we not managed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n240\r\nto escape their clutches our days would long since have ended.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it,\" repeated Glinda.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore I have come to beg your assistance,\" resumed the Scarecrow, \"for\r\nI believe you are always glad to succor the unfortunate and oppressed.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" replied the Sorceress, slowly. \"But the Emerald City is now\r\nruled by General Jinjur, who has caused herself to be proclaimed Queen. What\r\nright have I to oppose her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, she stole the throne from me,\" said the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"And how came you to possess the throne?\" asked Glinda.\r\n\r\n\"I got it from the Wizard of Oz, and by the choice of the people,\" returned\r\nthe Scarecrow, uneasy at such questioning.\r\n\r\n\"And where did the Wizard get it?\" she continued gravely.\r\n\r\n\"I am told he took it from Pastoria, the former King,\" said the Scarecrow,\r\nbecoming confused under the intent look of the Sorceress.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" declared Glinda, \"the throne of the Emerald City belongs neither to\r\nyou nor to Jinjur, but to this Pastoria from whom the Wizard usurped it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" acknowledged the Scarecrow,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n241\r\nhumbly; \"but Pastoria is now dead and gone, and some one must rule in his\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pastoria had a daughter, who is the rightful heir to the throne of the\r\nEmerald City. Did you know that?\" questioned the Sorceress.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"But if the girl still lives I will not stand\r\nin her way. It will satisfy me as well to have Jinjur turned out, as an\r\nimpostor, as to regain the throne myself. In fact, it isn't much fun to be\r\nKing, especially if one has good brains. I have known for some time that I\r\nam fitted to occupy a far more exalted position. But where is the girl who\r\nowns the throne, and what is her name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her name is Ozma,\" answered Glinda. \"But where she is I have tried in vain\r\nto discover. For the Wizard of Oz, when he stole the throne from Ozma's\r\nfather, hid the girl in some secret place; and by means of a magical trick\r\nwith which I am not familiar he also managed to prevent her being discovered--even\r\nby so experienced a Sorceress as myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is strange,\" interrupted the Woggle-Bug, pompously. \"I have been\r\ninformed that the Wonderful Wizard of Oz was nothing more than a humbug!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n242\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" exclaimed the Scarecrow, much provoked by this speech. \"Didn't\r\nhe give me a wonderful set of brains?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no humbug about my heart,\" announced the Tin Woodman, glaring\r\nindignantly at the Woggle-Bug.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I was misinformed,\" stammered the Insect, shrinking back; \"I never\r\nknew the Wizard personally.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we did,\" retorted the Scarecrow, \"and he was a very great Wizard, I\r\nassure you. It is true he was guilty of some slight impostures, but unless\r\nhe was a great Wizard how--let me ask--could he have hidden this girl\r\nOzma so securely that no one can find her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I give it up!\" replied the Woggle-Bug, meekly.\r\n\r\n\"That is the most sensible speech you've made,\" said the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n\"I must really make another effort to discover where this girl is hidden,\"\r\nresumed the Sorceress, thoughtfully. \"I have in my library a book in which\r\nis inscribed every action of the Wizard while he was in our land of Oz--or,\r\nat least, every action that could be observed by my spies. This book I\r\nwill read carefully tonight, and try to single out the acts that may guide\r\nus in discovering the lost Ozma. In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n243\r\nthe meantime, pray amuse yourselves in my palace and command my servants as\r\nif they were your own. I will grant you another audience tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nWith this gracious speech Glinda dismissed the adventurers, and they\r\nwandered away through the beautiful gardens, where they passed several hours\r\nenjoying all the delightful things with which the Queen of the Southland had\r\nsurrounded her royal palace.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning they again appeared before Glinda, who said to\r\nthem:\r\n\r\n\"I have searched carefully through the records of the Wizard's actions, and\r\namong them I can find but three that appear to have been suspicious. He ate\r\nbeans with a knife, made three secret visits to old Mombi, and limped\r\nslightly on his left foot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! that last is certainly suspicious!\" exclaimed the Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n\"Not necessarily,\" said the Scarecrow. \"he may, have had corns. Now, it\r\nseems to me his eating beans with a knife is more suspicious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it is a polite custom in Omaha, from which great country the Wizard\r\noriginally came,\" suggested the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n\"It may be,\" admitted the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n244\r\n\r\n\"But why,\" asked Glinda, \"did he make three secret visits to old Mombi?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Why, indeed!\" echoed the Woggle-Bug, impressively.\r\n\r\n\"We know that the Wizard taught the old woman many of his tricks of magic,\"\r\ncontinued Glinda; \"and this he would not have done had she not assisted him\r\nin some way. So we may suspect with good reason that Mombi aided him to hide\r\nthe girl Ozma, who was the real heir to the throne of the Emerald City, and\r\na constant danger to the usurper. For, if the people knew that she lived,\r\nthey would quickly make her their Queen and restore her to her rightful\r\nposition.\"\r\n\r\n\"An able argument!\" cried the Scarecrow. \"I have no doubt that Mombi was\r\nmixed up in this wicked business. But how does that knowledge help us?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must find Mombi,\" replied Glinda, \"and force her to tell where the girl\r\nis hidden.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mombi is now with Queen Jinjur, in the Emerald, City\" said Tip. \"It was she\r\nwho threw so many obstacles in our pathway, and made Jinjur threaten to\r\ndestroy my friends and give me back into the old witch's power.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" decided Glinda, \"I will march with my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n245\r\narmy to the Emerald City, and take Mombi prisoner. After that we can,\r\nperhaps, force her to tell the truth about Ozma.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is a terrible old woman!\" remarked Tip, with a shudder at the thought\r\nof Mombi's black kettle; \"and obstinate, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am quite obstinate myself,\" returned the Sorceress, with a sweet smile.\r\n\"so I do not fear Mombi in the least. Today I will make all necessary\r\npreparations, and we will march upon the Emerald City at daybreak tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n246               The Tin-Woodman Plucks a Rose\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Army of Glinda the Good looked very grand and imposing when it assembled\r\nat daybreak before the palace gates. The uniforms of the girl soldiers were\r\npretty and of gay colors, and their silver-tipped spears were bright and\r\nglistening, the long shafts being inlaid with mother-of-pearl. All the\r\nofficers wore sharp, gleaming swords, and shields edged with peacock-feathers;\r\nand it really seemed that no foe could by any possibility defeat\r\nsuch a brilliant army.\r\n\r\nThe Sorceress rode in a beautiful palanquin which was like the body of a\r\ncoach, having doors and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n247\r\nwindows with silken curtains; but instead of wheels, which a coach has, the\r\npalanquin rested upon two long, horizontal bars, which were borne upon the\r\nshoulders of twelve servants.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow and his comrades decided to ride in the Gump, in order to keep\r\nup with the swift march of the army; so, as soon as Glinda had started and\r\nher soldiers had marched away to the inspiring strains of music played by\r\nthe royal band, our friends climbed into the sofas and followed. The Gump\r\nflew along slowly at a point directly over the palanquin in which rode the\r\nSorceress.\r\n\r\n\"Be careful,\" said the\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n248\r\nTin Woodman to the Scarecrow, who was leaning far over the side to look at\r\nthe army below. \"You might fall.\"\r\n\r\n\"It wouldn't matter,\" remarked the educated Woggle-Bug. \"he can't get broke\r\nso long as he is stuffed with money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't I ask you\" began Tip, in a reproachful voice.\r\n\r\n\"You did!\" said the Woggle-Bug, promptly. \"And I beg your pardon. I will\r\nreally try to restrain myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better,\" declared the boy. \"That is, if you wish to travel in our\r\ncompany.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I couldn't bear to part with you now,\" murmured the Insect, feelingly;\r\nso Tip let the subject drop.\r\n\r\nThe army moved steadily on, but night had fallen before they came to the\r\nwalls of the Emerald City. By the dim light of the new moon, however,\r\nGlinda's forces silently surrounded the city and pitched their tents of\r\nscarlet silk upon the greensward. The tent of the Sorceress was larger than\r\nthe others, and was composed of pure white silk, with scarlet banners flying\r\nabove it. A tent was also pitched for the Scarecrow's party; and when these\r\npreparations had been made, with military precision and quickness, the army\r\nretired to rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n249\r\n\r\nGreat was the amazement of Queen Jinjur next morning when her soldiers came\r\nrunning to inform her of the vast army surrounding them. She at once climbed\r\nto a high tower of the royal palace and saw banners waving in every\r\ndirection and the great white tent of Glinda standing directly before the\r\ngates.\r\n\r\n\"We are surely lost!\" cried Jinjur, in despair; \"for how can our\r\nknitting-needles avail against the long spears and terrible swords of our foes?\"\r\n\r\n\"The best thing we can do,\" said one of the girls, \"is to surrender as\r\nquickly as possible, before we get hurt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so,\" returned Jinjur, more bravely. \"The enemy is still outside the\r\nwalls, so we must try to gain time by engaging them in parley. Go you with a\r\nflag of truce to Glinda and ask her why she has dared to invade my\r\ndominions, and what are her demands.\"\r\n\r\nSo the girl passed through the gates, bearing a white flag to show she was\r\non a mission of peace, and came to Glinda's tent. \"Tell your Queen,\" said\r\nthe Sorceress to the girl, \"that she must deliver up to me old Mombi, to be\r\nmy prisoner. If this is done I will not molest her farther.\"\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n250\r\n\r\nNow when this message was delivered to the Queen it filled her with dismay,\r\nfor Mombi was her chief counsellor, and Jinjur was terribly afraid of the\r\nold hag. But she sent for Mombi, and told her what Glinda had said.\r\n\r\n\"I see trouble ahead for all of us,\" muttered the old witch, after glancing\r\ninto a magic mirror she carried in her pocket. \"But we may even yet escape\r\nby deceiving this sorceress, clever as she thinks herself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think it will be safer for me to deliver you into her hands?\"\r\nasked Jinjur, nervously.\r\n\r\n\"If you do, it will cost you the throne of the Emerald City!\" answered the\r\nwitch, positively. \"But if you will let me have my own way, I can save us\r\nboth very easily.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then do as you please,\" replied Jinjur, \"for it is so aristocratic to be a\r\nQueen that I do not wish to be obliged to return home again, to make beds\r\nand wash dishes for my mother.\"\r\n\r\nSo Mombi called Jellia Jamb to her, and performed a certain magical rite\r\nwith which she was familiar. As a result of the enchantment Jellia took on\r\nthe form and features of Mombi, while the old witch grew to resemble the\r\ngirl so closely that it seemed impossible anyone could guess the deception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n251\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said old Mombi to the Queen, \"let your soldiers deliver up this girl\r\nto Glinda. She will think she has the real Mombi in her power, and so will\r\nreturn immediately to her own country in the South.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore Jellia, hobbling along like an aged\r\n\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\nwoman, was led from the city gates and taken before Glinda.\r\n\r\n\"Here is the person you demanded,\" said one of the guards, \"and our Queen\r\nnow begs you will go away, as you promised, and leave us in peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I will surely do,\" replied Glinda, much pleased; \"if this is really\r\nthe person she seems to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is certainly old Mombi,\" said the guard, who believed she was speaking\r\nthe truth; and then Jinjur's soldiers returned within the city's gates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n252\r\n\r\nThe Sorceress quickly summoned the Scarecrow and his friends to her tent,\r\nand began to question the supposed Mombi about the lost girl Ozma. But\r\nJellia knew nothing at all of this affair, and presently she grew so nervous\r\nunder the questioning that she gave way and began to weep, to Glinda's great\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Here is some foolish trickery!\" said the Sorceress, her eyes flashing with\r\nanger. \"This is not Mombi at all, but some other person who has been made to\r\nresemble her! Tell me,\" she demanded, turning to the trembling girl, \"what\r\nis your name?\"\r\n\r\nThis Jellia dared not tell, having been threatened with death by the witch\r\nif she confessed the fraud. But Glinda, sweet and fair though she was,\r\nunderstood magic better than any other person in the Land of Oz. So, by\r\nuttering a few potent words and making a peculiar gesture, she quickly\r\ntransformed the girl into her proper shape, while at the same time old\r\nMombi, far away in Jinjur's palace, suddenly resumed her own crooked form\r\nand evil features.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's Jellia Jamb!\" cried the Scarecrow, recognizing in the girl one of\r\nhis old friends.\r\n\r\n\"It's our interpreter!\" said the Pumpkinhead, smiling pleasantly.\r\n\r\nThen Jellia was forced to tell of the trick Mombi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n253\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\nhad played and she also begged Glinda's protection, which the Sorceress\r\nreadily granted. But Glinda was now really angry, and sent word to Jinjur\r\nthat the fraud was discovered and she must deliver up the real Mombi or\r\nsuffer terrible consequences. Jinjur was prepared for this message, for the\r\nwitch well understood, when her natural form was thrust upon her, that\r\nGlinda had discovered her trickery. But the wicked old creature had already\r\nthought up a new deception, and had made Jinjur promise to carry it out. So\r\nthe Queen said to Glinda's messenger:\r\n\r\n\"Tell your mistress that I cannot find Mombi anywhere, but that Glinda is\r\nwelcome to enter the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n254\r\ncity and search herself for the old woman. She may also bring her friends\r\nwith her, if she likes; but if she does not find Mombi by sundown, the\r\nSorceress must promise to go away peaceably and bother us no more.\"\r\n\r\nGlinda agreed to these terms, well knowing that Mombi was somewhere within\r\nthe city walls. So Jinjur caused the gates to be thrown open, and Glinda\r\nmarched in at the head of a company of soldiers, followed by the Scarecrow\r\nand the Tin Woodman, while Jack Pumpkinhead rode astride the Saw-Horse, and\r\nthe Educated, Highly Magnified Woggle-Bug sauntered behind in a dignified\r\nmanner. Tip walked by the side of the Sorceress, for Glinda had conceived a\r\ngreat liking for the boy.\r\n\r\nOf course old Mombi had no intention of being found by Glinda; so, while her\r\nenemies were marching up the street, the witch transformed herself into a\r\nred rose growing upon a bush in the garden of the palace. It was a clever\r\nidea, and a trick Glinda did not suspect; so several precious hours were\r\nspent in a vain search for Mombi.\r\n\r\nAs sundown approached the Sorceress realized she had been defeated by the\r\nsuperior cunning of the aged witch; so she gave the command to her people to\r\nmarch out of the city and back to their tents.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow and his comrades happened to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n255\r\nsearching in the garden of the palace just then, and they turned with\r\ndisappointment to obey Glinda's command. But before they left the garden the\r\nTin Woodman, who was fond of flowers, chanced to espy a big red rose growing\r\nupon a bush; so he plucked the flower and fastened it securely in the tin\r\nbuttonhole of his tin bosom.\r\n\r\nAs he did this he fancied he heard a low moan proceed from the rose; but he\r\npaid no attention to the sound, and Mombi was thus carried out of the city\r\nand into Glinda's camp without anyone having a suspicion that they had\r\nsucceeded in their quest.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n256               The Transformation of Old Mombi\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Witch was at first frightened at finding herself captured by the enemy;\r\nbut soon she decided that she was exactly as safe in the Tin Woodman's\r\nbutton-hole as growing upon the bush. For no one knew the rose and Mombi to\r\nbe one, and now that she was without the gates of the City her chances of\r\nescaping altogether from Glinda were much improved.\r\n\r\n\"But there is no hurry,\" thought Mombi. \"I will wait awhile and enjoy the\r\nhumiliation of this Sorceress when she finds I have outwitted her.\" So\r\nthroughout the night the rose lay quietly on the Woodman's bosom, and in the\r\nmorning, when Glinda summoned our friends to a consultation, Nick Chopper\r\ncarried his pretty flower with him to the white silk tent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n257               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For some reason,\" said Glinda, \"we have failed to find this cunning old\r\nMombi; so I fear our expedition will prove a failure. And for that I am\r\nsorry, because without our assistance little Ozma will never be rescued and\r\nrestored to her rightful position as Queen of the Emerald City\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not let us give up so easily,\" said the Pumpkinhead. \"Let us do\r\nsomething else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Something else must really be done,\" replied Glinda, with a smile. \"yet I\r\ncannot understand how I have been defeated so easily by an old Witch who\r\nknows far less of magic than I do myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"While we are on the ground I believe it would be wise for us to conquer the\r\nEmerald City for Princess Ozma, and find the girl afterward,\" said the\r\nScarecrow.\" And while the girl remains hidden I will gladly rule in her\r\nplace, for I understand the business of ruling much better than Jinjur\r\ndoes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n258\r\n\r\n\"But I have promised not to molest Jinjur,\" objected Glinda.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you all return with me to my kingdom--or Empire, rather,\" said\r\nthe Tin Woodman, politely including the entire party in a royal wave of his\r\narm. \"It will give me great pleasure to entertain you in my castle, where\r\nthere is room enough and to spare. And if any of you wish to be nickel-\r\nplated, my valet will do it free of all expense.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the Woodman was speaking Glinda's eyes had been noting the rose in his\r\nbutton-hole, and now she imagined she saw the big red leaves of the flower\r\ntremble slightly. This quickly aroused her suspicions, and in a moment more\r\nthe Sorceress had decided that the seeming rose was nothing else than a\r\ntransformation of old Mombi. At the same instant Mombi knew she was\r\ndiscovered and must quickly plan an escape, and as transformations were easy\r\nto her she immediately took the form of a Shadow and glided along the wall\r\nof the tent toward the entrance, thinking thus to disappear.\r\n\r\nBut Glinda had not only equal cunning, but far more experience than the\r\nWitch. So the Sorceress reached the opening of the tent before the Shadow,\r\nand with a wave of her hand closed the entrance so securely that Mombi could\r\nnot find a crack big\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n259\r\nenough to creep through. The Scarecrow and his friends were greatly\r\nsurprised at Glinda's actions; for none of them had noted the Shadow. But\r\nthe Sorceress said to them:\r\n\r\n\"Remain perfectly quiet, all of you! For the old Witch is even now with us\r\nin this tent, and I hope to capture her.\"\r\n\r\nThese words so alarmed Mombi that she quickly transformed herself from a\r\nshadow to a Black Ant, in which shape she crawled along the ground, seeking\r\na crack or crevice in which to hide her tiny body.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the ground where the tent had been pitched, being Just before\r\nthe city gates, was hard and smooth; and while the Ant still crawled about,\r\nGlinda discovered it and ran quickly forward to effect its capture But, Just\r\nas her hand was descending, the Witch, now fairly frantic with fear, made\r\nher last transformation, and in the form of a huge Griffin sprang through\r\nthe wall of the tent--tearing the silk asunder in her rush--and in a\r\nmoment had darted away with the speed of a whirlwind.\r\n\r\nGlinda did not hesitate to follow. She sprang upon the back of the Saw-Horse\r\nand cried:\r\n\r\n\"Now you shall prove that you have a right to be alive! Run--run--run!\"\r\n\r\nThe Saw-Horse ran. Like a flash he followed the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n260\r\nGriffin, his wooden legs moving so fast that they twinkled like the rays of\r\na star. Before our friends could recover from their surprise both the\r\nGriffin and the Saw-Horse had dashed out of sight.\r\n\r\n\"Come! Let us follow!\" cried the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\nThey ran to the place where the Gump was lying and quickly tumbled aboard.\r\n\r\n\"Fly!\" commanded Tip, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Where to?\" asked the Gump, in its calm voice.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" returned Tip, who was very nervous at the delay; \"but if you\r\nwill mount into the air I think we can discover which way Glinda has gone.\"\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n261\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" returned the Gump, quietly; and it spread its great wings and\r\nmounted high into the air.\r\n\r\nFar away, across the meadows, they could now see two tiny specks, speeding\r\none after the other; and they knew these specks must be the Griffin and the\r\nSaw-Horse. So Tip called the Gump's attention to them and bade the creature\r\ntry to overtake the Witch and the Sorceress. But, swift as was the Gump's\r\nflight, the pursued and pursuer moved more swiftly yet, and within a few\r\nmoments were blotted out against the dim horizon.\r\n\r\n\"Let us continue to follow them, nevertheless,\" said the Scarecrow. \"for the\r\nLand of Oz is of small extent, and sooner or later they must both come to a\r\nhalt.\"\r\n\r\nOld Mombi had thought herself very wise to choose the form of a Griffin, for\r\nits legs were exceedingly fleet and its strength more enduring than that of\r\nother animals. But she had not reckoned on the untiring energy of the\r\nSaw-Horse, whose wooden limbs could run for days without slacking their speed.\r\nTherefore, after an hour's hard running, the Griffin's breath began to fail,\r\nand it panted and gasped painfully, and moved more slowly than before. Then\r\nit reached the edge of the desert and began racing across the deep sands.\r\nBut its tired feet sank far\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n262\r\ninto the sand, and in a few minutes the Griffin fell forward, completely\r\nexhausted, and lay still upon the desert waste.\r\n\r\nGlinda came up a moment later, riding the still vigorous Saw-Horse; and\r\nhaving unwound a slender golden thread from her girdle the Sorceress threw\r\nit over the head of the panting and helpless Griffin, and so destroyed the\r\nmagical power of Mombi's transformation.\r\n\r\nFor the animal, with one fierce shudder, disappeared from view, while in its\r\nplace was discovered the form of the old Witch, glaring savagely at the\r\nserene and beautiful face of the Sorceress.\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n263               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n264               Princess Ozma of Oz\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You are my prisoner, and it is useless for you to struggle any longer,\"\r\nsaid Glinda, in her soft, sweet voice. \"Lie still a moment, and rest\r\nyourself, and then I will carry you back to my tent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you seek me?\" asked Mombi, still scarce able to speak plainly for\r\nlack of breath. \"What have I done to you, to be so persecuted?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have done nothing to me,\" answered the gentle Sorceress; \"but I suspect\r\nyou have been guilty of several wicked actions; and if I find it is true\r\nthat you have so abused your knowledge of magic, I intend to punish you\r\nseverely.\"\r\n\r\n\"I defy you!\" croaked the old hag. \"You dare not harm me!\"\r\n\r\nJust then the Gump flew up to them and alighted upon the desert sands beside\r\nGlinda. Our friends\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n265\r\nwere delighted to find that Mombi had finally been captured, and after a\r\nhurried consultation it was decided they should all return to the camp in\r\nthe Gump. So the Saw-Horse was tossed aboard, and then Glinda still holding\r\nan end of the golden thread that was around Mombi's neck, forced her\r\nprisoner to climb into the sofas. The others now followed, and Tip gave the\r\nword to the Gump to return.\r\n\r\nThe Journey was made in safety, Mombi sitting in her place with a grim and\r\nsullen air; for the old hag was absolutely helpless so long as the magical\r\nthread encircled her throat. The army hailed Glinda's return with loud\r\ncheers, and the party of friends soon gathered again in the royal tent,\r\nwhich had been neatly repaired during their absence.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said the Sorceress to Mombi, \"I want you to tell us why the Wonderful\r\nWizard of Oz paid you three visits, and what became of the child, Ozma,\r\nwhich so curiously disappeared.\"\r\n\r\nThe Witch looked at Glinda defiantly, but said not a word.\r\n\r\n\"Answer me!\" cried the Sorceress.\r\n\r\nBut still Mombi remained silent.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps she doesn't know,\" remarked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"I beg you will keep quiet,\" said Tip. \"You might spoil everything with your\r\nfoolishness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n266\r\n\r\n\"Very well, dear father!\" returned the Pumpkinhead, meekly.\r\n\r\n\"How glad I am to be a Woggle-Bug!\" murmured the Highly Magnified Insect,\r\nsoftly. \"No one can expect wisdom to flow from a pumpkin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the Scarecrow, \"what shall we do to make Mombi speak? Unless\r\nshe tells us what we wish to know her capture will do us no good at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we try kindness,\" suggested the Tin Woodman. \"I've heard that\r\nanyone can be conquered with kindness, no matter how ugly they may be.\"\r\n\r\nAt this the Witch turned to glare upon him so horribly that the Tin Woodman\r\nshrank back abashed.\r\n\r\nGlinda had been carefully considering what to do, and now she turned to\r\nMombi and said:\r\n\r\n\"You will gain nothing, I assure you, by thus defying us. For I am\r\ndetermined to learn the truth about the girl Ozma, and unless you tell me\r\nall that you know, I will certainly put you to death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no! Don't do that!\" exclaimed the Tin Woodman. \"It would be an awful\r\nthing to kill anyone--even old Mombi!\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is merely a threat,\" returned Glinda. \"I shall not put Mombi to\r\ndeath, because she will prefer to tell me the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I see!\" said the tin man, much relieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n267\r\n\r\n\"Suppose I tell you all that you wish to know,\". said Mombi, speaking so\r\nsuddenly that she startled them all. \"What will you do with me then?\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" replied Glinda, \"I shall merely ask you to drink a powerful\r\ndraught which will cause you to forget all the magic you have ever learned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I would become a helpless old woman!\"\r\n\r\n\"But you would be alive,\" suggested the Pumpkinhead, consolingly.\r\n\r\n\"Do try to keep silent!\" said Tip, nervously.\r\n\r\n\"I'll try,\" responded Jack; \"but you will admit that it's a good thing to be\r\nalive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Especially if one happens to be Thoroughly Educated,\" added the Woggle-Bug,\r\nnodding approval.\r\n\r\n\"You may make your choice,\" Glinda said to old Mombi, \"between death if you\r\nremain silent, and the loss of your magical powers if you tell me the truth.\r\nBut I think you will prefer to live.\r\n\r\nMombi cast an uneasy glance at the Sorceress, and saw that she was in\r\nearnest, and not to be trifled with. So she replied, slowly:\r\n\r\n\"I will answer your questions.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what I expected,\" said Glinda, pleasantly. \"You have chosen wisely,\r\nI assure you.\"\r\n\r\nShe then motioned to one of her Captains, who brought her a beautiful golden\r\ncasket. From this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n268\r\nthe Sorceress drew an immense white pearl, attached to a slender chain which\r\nshe placed around her neck in such a way that the pearl rested upon her\r\nbosom, directly over her heart.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said she, \"I will ask my first question: Why did the Wizard pay you\r\nthree visits?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I would not come to him,\" answered Mombi.\r\n\r\n\"That is no answer,\" said Glinda, sternly. \"Tell me the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" returned Mombi, with downcast eyes, \"he visited me to learn the way\r\nI make tea-biscuits.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look up!\" commanded the Sorceress.\r\n\r\nMombi obeyed.\r\n\r\n\"What is the color of my pearl?\" demanded Glinda.\r\n\r\n\"Why--it is black!\" replied the old Witch, in a tone of wonder.\r\n\r\n\"Then you have told me a falsehood!\" cried Glinda, angrily. \"Only when the\r\ntruth is spoken will my magic pearl remain a pure white in color.\"\r\n\r\nMombi now saw how useless it was to try to deceive the Sorceress; so she\r\nsaid, meanwhile scowling at her defeat:\r\n\r\n\"The Wizard brought to me the girl Ozma, who was then no more than a baby,\r\nand begged me to conceal the child.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n269\r\n\r\n\"That is what I thought,\" declared Glinda, calmly. \"What did he give you for\r\nthus serving him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He taught me all the magical tricks he knew. Some were good tricks, and\r\nsome were only frauds; but I have remained faithful to my promise.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you do with the girl?\" asked Glinda; and at this question everyone\r\nbent forward and listened eagerly for the reply.\r\n\r\n\"I enchanted her,\" answered Mombi.\r\n\r\n\"In what way?\"\r\n\r\n\"I transformed her into--into--\"\r\n\r\n\"Into what?\" demanded Glinda, as the Witch hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"Into a boy!\" said Mombi, in a low tone.\"\r\n\r\nA boy!\" echoed every voice; and then, because they knew that this old woman\r\nhad reared Tip from childhood, all eyes were turned to where the boy stood.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the old Witch, nodding her head; \"that is the Princess Ozma--the\r\nchild brought to me by the Wizard who stole her father's throne. That is\r\nthe rightful ruler of the Emerald City!\" and she pointed her long bony\r\nfinger straight at the boy.\r\n\r\n\"I!\" cried Tip, in amazement. \"Why, I'm no Princess Ozma--I'm not a girl!\"\r\n\r\nGlinda smiled, and going to Tip she took his small brown hand within her\r\ndainty white one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n270               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n               MOMBI POINTED HER LONG, BONY FINGER AT THE BOY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n271\r\n\r\n\"You are not a girl just now\" said she, gently, \"because Mombi transformed\r\nyou into a boy. But you were born a girl, and also a Princess; so you must\r\nresume your proper form, that you may become Queen of the Emerald City.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, let Jinjur be the Queen!\" exclaimed Tip, ready to cry. \"I want to stay\r\na boy, and travel with the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, and the Woggle-\r\nBug, and Jack--yes! and my friend the Saw-Horse--and the Gump! I don't\r\nwant to be a girl!\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, old chap,\" said the Tin Woodman, soothingly; \"it don't hurt to\r\nbe a girl, I'm told; and we will all remain your faithful friends just the\r\nsame. And, to be honest with you, I've always considered girls nicer than\r\nboys.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're just as nice, anyway,\" added the Scarecrow, patting Tip\r\naffectionately upon the head.\r\n\r\n\"And they are equally good students,\" proclaimed the Woggle-Bug. \"I should\r\nlike to become your tutor, when you are transformed into a girl again.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--see here!\" said Jack Pumpkinhead, with a gasp: \"if you become a\r\ngirl, you can't be my dear father any more!\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Tip, laughing in spite of his anxiety. \"and I shall not be\r\nsorry to escape the relationship.\" Then he added, hesitatingly, as he turned\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n272               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\nGlinda: \"I might try it for awhile,-just to see how it seems, you know. But\r\nif I don't like being a girl you must promise to change me into a boy\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really,\" said the Sorceress, \"that is beyond my magic. I never deal in\r\ntransformations, for they are not honest, and no respectable sorceress likes\r\nto make things appear to be what they are not. Only unscrupulous witches use\r\nthe art, and therefore I must ask Mombi to effect your release from her\r\ncharm, and restore you to your proper form. It will be the last opportunity\r\nshe will have to practice magic.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n273\r\n\r\nNow that the truth about Princes Ozma had been discovered, Mombi did not\r\ncare what became of Tip; but she feared Glinda's anger, and the boy\r\ngenerously promised to provide for Mombi in her old age if he became the\r\nruler of the Emerald City. So the Witch consented to effect the\r\ntransformation, and preparations for the event were at once made.\r\n\r\nGlinda ordered her own royal couch to be placed in the center of the tent.\r\nIt was piled high with cushions covered with rose-colored silk, and from a\r\ngolden railing above hung many folds of pink gossamer, completely concealing\r\nthe interior of the couch.\r\n\r\nThe first act of the Witch was to make the boy drink a potion which quickly\r\nsent him into a deep and dreamless sleep. Then the Tin Woodman and the\r\nWoggle-Bug bore him gently to the couch, placed him upon the soft cushions,\r\nand drew the gossamer hangings to shut him from all earthly view.\r\n\r\nThe Witch squatted upon the ground and kindled a tiny fire of dried herbs,\r\nwhich she drew from her bosom. When the blaze shot up and burned clearly old\r\nMombi scattered a handful of magical powder over the fire, which straightway\r\ngave off a rich violet vapor, filling all the tent with its fragrance and\r\nforcing the Saw-Horse to sneeze--although he had been warned to keep\r\nquiet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n274               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n               MOMBI AT HER MAGICAL INCANTATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n275\r\n\r\nThen, while the others watched her curiously, the hag chanted a rhythmical\r\nverse in words which no one understood, and bent her lean body seven times\r\nback and forth over the fire. And now the incantation seemed complete, for\r\nthe Witch stood upright and cried the one word \"Yeowa!\" in a loud voice.\r\n\r\nThe vapor floated away; the atmosphere became, clear again; a whiff of fresh\r\nair filled the tent, and the pink curtains of the couch trembled slightly,\r\nas if stirred from within.\r\n\r\nGlinda walked to the canopy and parted the silken hangings. Then she bent\r\nover the cushions, reached out her hand, and from the couch arose the form\r\nof a young girl, fresh and beautiful as a May morning. Her eyes sparkled as\r\ntwo diamonds, and her lips were tinted like a tourmaline. All adown her back\r\nfloated tresses of ruddy gold, with a slender jeweled circlet confining them\r\nat the brow. Her robes of silken gauze floated around her like a cloud, and\r\ndainty satin slippers shod her feet.\r\n\r\nAt this exquisite vision Tip's old comrades stared in wonder for the space\r\nof a full minute, and then every head bent low in honest admiration of the\r\nlovely Princess Ozma. The girl herself cast one look into Glinda's bright\r\nface, which glowed with pleasure and satisfaction, and then turned upon the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n276\r\nothers. Speaking the words with sweet diffidence, she said:\r\n\r\n\"I hope none of you will care less for me than you did before. I'm just the\r\nsame Tip, you know; only--only--\"\r\n\r\n\"Only you're different!\" said the Pumpkinhead; and everyone thought it was\r\nthe wisest speech he had ever made.\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n277               Full page line-art drawing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n278               The Riches of Content\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the wonderful tidings reached the ears of Queen Jinjur--how Mombi the\r\nWitch had been captured; how she had confessed her crime to Glinda; and how\r\nthe long-lost Princess Ozma had been discovered in no less a personage than\r\nthe boy Tip--she wept real tears of grief and despair.\r\n\r\n\"To think,\" she moaned, \"that after having ruled as Queen, and lived in a\r\npalace, I must go back to scrubbing floors and churning butter again! It is\r\ntoo horrible to think of! I will never consent!\"\r\n\r\nSo when her soldiers, who spent most of their time making fudge in the\r\npalace kitchens, counseled Jinjur to resist, she listened to their foolish\r\nprattle and sent a sharp defiance to Glinda the Good and the Princess Ozma.\r\nThe result was a declaration of war, and the very next day Glinda marched\r\nupon the Emerald City with pennants flying and bands playing,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n279\r\nand a forest of shining spears, sparkling brightly beneath the sun's rays.\r\n\r\nBut when it came to the walls this brave assembly made a sudden halt; for\r\nJinjur had closed and barred every gateway, and the walls of the Emerald\r\nCity were builded high and thick with many blocks of green marble. Finding\r\nher advance thus baffled, Glinda bent her brows in deep thought, while the\r\nWoggle-Bug said, in his most positive tone:\r\n\r\n\"We must lay siege to the city, and starve it into submission. It is the\r\nonly thing we can do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so,\" answered the Scarecrow. \"We still have the Gump, and the Gump can\r\nstill fly\"\r\n\r\nThe Sorceress turned quickly at this speech, and her face now wore a bright\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" she exclaimed, \"and certainly have reason to be proud of\r\nyour brains. Let us go to the Gump at once!\"\r\n\r\nSo they passed through the ranks of the army until they came to the place,\r\nnear the Scarecrow's tent, where the Gump lay. Glinda and Princess Ozma\r\nmounted first, and sat upon the sofas. Then the Scarecrow and his friends\r\nclimbed aboard, and still there was room for a Captain and three soldiers,\r\nwhich Glinda considered sufficient for a guard.\r\n\r\nNow, at a word from the Princess, the queer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n280               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\nThing they had called the Gump flopped its palm-leaf wings and rose into the\r\nair, carrying the party of adventurers high above the walls. They hovered\r\nover the palace, and soon perceived Jinjur reclining in a hammock in the\r\ncourtyard, where she was comfortably reading a novel with a green cover and\r\neating green chocolates, confident that the walls would protect her from her\r\nenemies. Obeying a quick command, the Gump alighted safely in this very\r\ncourtyard, and before Jinjur had time to do more than scream, the Captain\r\nand three soldiers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n281\r\nleaped out and made the former Queen a prisoner, locking strong chains upon\r\nboth her wrists.\r\n\r\nThat act really ended the war; for the Army of Revolt submitted as soon as\r\nthey knew Jinjur to be a captive, and the Captain marched in safety through\r\nthe streets and up to the gates of the city, which she threw wide open. Then\r\nthe bands played their most stirring music while Glinda's army marched into\r\nthe city, and heralds proclaimed the conquest of the audacious Jinjur and\r\nthe accession of the beautiful Princess Ozma to the throne of her royal\r\nancestors.\r\n\r\nAt once the men of the Emerald City cast off their aprons. And it is said\r\nthat the women were so tired eating of their husbands' cooking that they\r\n\r\n               Line-Art Drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n282\r\nall hailed the conquest of Jinjur with Joy. Certain it is that, rushing one\r\nand all to the kitchens of their houses, the good wives prepared so\r\ndelicious a feast for the weary men that harmony was immediately restored in\r\nevery family.\r\n\r\nOzma's first act was to oblige the Army of Revolt to return to her every\r\nemerald or other gem stolen from the public streets and buildings; and so\r\ngreat was the number of precious stones picked from their settings by these\r\nvain girls, that every one of the royal jewelers worked steadily for more\r\nthan a month to replace them in their settings.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Army of Revolt was disbanded and the girls sent home to their\r\nmothers. On promise of good behavior Jinjur was likewise released.\r\n\r\nOzma made the loveliest Queen the Emerald City had ever known; and, although\r\nshe was so young and inexperienced, she ruled her people with wisdom and\r\nJustice. For Glinda gave her good advice on all occasions; and the\r\nWoggle-Bug, who was appointed to the important post of Public Educator, was quite\r\nhelpful to Ozma when her royal duties grew perplexing.\r\n\r\nThe girl, in her gratitude to the Gump for its services, offered the\r\ncreature any reward it might name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n283\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" replied the Gump, \"please take me to pieces. I did not wish to be\r\nbrought to life, and I am greatly ashamed of my conglomerate personality.\r\nOnce I was a monarch of the forest, as my antlers fully prove; but now, in\r\nmy present upholstered condition of servitude, I am compelled to fly through\r\nthe air--my legs being of no use to me whatever. Therefore I beg to be\r\ndispersed.\"\r\n\r\nSo Ozma ordered the Gump taken apart. The antlered head was again hung over\r\nthe mantle-piece in the hall, and the sofas were untied and placed in the\r\nreception parlors. The broom tail resumed its accustomed duties in the\r\nkitchen, and finally, the Scarecrow replaced all the clotheslines and ropes\r\non the pegs from which he had taken them on the eventful day when the Thing\r\nwas constructed.\r\n\r\nYou might think that was the end of the Gump; and so it was, as a\r\nflying-machine. But the head over the mantle-piece continued to talk whenever it\r\ntook a notion to do so, and it frequently startled, with its abrupt\r\nquestions, the people who waited in the hall for an audience with the Queen.\r\n\r\nThe Saw-Horse, being Ozma's personal property, was tenderly cared for; and\r\noften she rode the queer creature along the streets of the Emerald City. She\r\nhad its wooden legs shod with gold, to keep them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n284\r\nfrom wearing out, and the tinkle of these golden shoes upon the pavement\r\nalways filled the Queen's subjects with awe as they thought upon this\r\nevidence of her magical powers.\r\n\r\n\"The Wonderful Wizard was never so wonderful as Queen Ozma,\" the people said\r\nto one another, in whispers; \"for he claimed to do many things he could not\r\ndo; whereas our new Queen does many things no one would ever expect her to\r\naccomplish.\"\r\n\r\nJack Pumpkinhead remained with Ozma to the end of his days; and he did not\r\nspoil as soon as he had feared, although he always remained as stupid as\r\never. The Woggle-Bug tried to teach him several arts and sciences; but Jack\r\nwas so poor a student that any attempt to educate him was soon abandoned.\r\n\r\nAfter Glinda's army had marched back home, and peace was restored to the\r\nEmerald City, the Tin Woodman announced his intention to return to his own\r\nKingdom of the Winkies.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't a very big Kingdom,\" said he to Ozma, \"but for that very reason it\r\nis easier to rule; and I have called myself an Emperor because I am an\r\nAbsolute Monarch, and no one interferes in any way with my conduct of public\r\nor personal affairs. When I get home I shall have a new coat of nickel\r\nplate; for I have become somewhat marred and scratched lately;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n285\r\nand then I shall be glad to have you pay me a visit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" replied Ozma. \"Some day I may accept the invitation. But what\r\nis to become of the Scarecrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall return with my friend the Tin Woodman,\" said the stuffed one,\r\nseriously. \"We have decided never to be parted in the future.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I have made the Scarecrow my Royal Treasurer,\" explained the Tin\r\nWoodman.\" For it has occurred to me that it is a good thing to have a Royal\r\nTreasurer who is made of money. What do you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said the little Queen, smiling, \"that your friend must be the\r\nrichest man in all the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" returned the Scarecrow. \"but not on account of my money. For I\r\nconsider brains far superior to money, in every way. You may have noticed\r\nthat if one has money without brains, he cannot use it to advantage; but if\r\none has brains without money, they will enable him to live comfortably to\r\nthe end of his days.\"\r\n\r\n\"At the same time,\" declared the Tin Woodman, \"you must acknowledge that a\r\ngood heart is a thing that brains can not create, and that money can not\r\nbuy. Perhaps, after all, it is I who am the richest man in all the world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n286\r\n\r\n\"You are both rich, my friends,\" said Ozma, gently; \"and your riches are the\r\nonly riches worth having--the riches of content!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               The End\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
