What did it turn out to be but a Pearl that by\r\nsome chance had been lost in the yard?  \"You may be a treasure,\"\r\nquoth Master Cock, \"to men that prize you, but for me I would\r\nrather have a single barley-corn than a peck of pearls.\"\r\n\r\nPrecious things are for those that can prize them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Wolf and the Lamb\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time a Wolf was lapping at a spring on a hillside,\r\nwhen, looking up, what should he see but a Lamb just beginning to\r\ndrink a little lower down.  \"There's my supper,\" thought he, \"if\r\nonly I can find some excuse to seize it.\"  Then he called out to\r\nthe Lamb, \"How dare you muddle the water from which I am\r\ndrinking?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, master, nay,\" said Lambikin; \"if the water be muddy up\r\nthere, I cannot be the cause of it, for it runs down from you to\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said the Wolf, \"why did you call me bad names\r\nthis time last year?\"\r\n\r\n\"That cannot be,\" said the Lamb; \"I am only six months old.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care,\" snarled the Wolf; \"if it was not you it was\r\nyour father;\" and with that he rushed upon the poor little Lamb\r\nand\r\n .WARRA WARRA WARRA WARRA WARRA\r\n .ate her all up.  But before she died she gasped out\r\n .\"Any excuse will serve a tyrant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Dog and the Shadow\r\n\r\n\r\nIt happened that a Dog had got a piece of meat and was\r\ncarrying it home in his mouth to eat it in peace.  Now on his way\r\nhome he had to cross a plank lying across a running brook.  As he\r\ncrossed, he looked down and saw his own shadow reflected in the\r\nwater beneath.  Thinking it was another dog with another piece of\r\nmeat, he made up his mind to have that also.  So he made a snap at\r\nthe shadow in the water, but as he opened his mouth the piece of\r\nmeat fell out, dropped into the water and was never seen more.\r\n\r\nBeware lest you lose the substance by grasping at the shadow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Lion's Share\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion went once a-hunting along with the Fox, the Jackal,\r\nand the Wolf.  They hunted and they hunted till at last they\r\nsurprised a Stag, and soon took its life.  Then came the question\r\nhow the spoil should be divided.  \"Quarter me this Stag,\" roared\r\nthe Lion; so the other animals skinned it and cut it into four\r\nparts.  Then the Lion took his stand in front of the carcass and\r\npronounced judgment:  The first quarter is for me in my capacity\r\nas King of Beasts; the second is mine as arbiter; another share\r\ncomes to me for my part in the chase; and as for the fourth\r\nquarter, well, as for that, I should like to see which of you will\r\ndare to lay a paw upon it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph,\" grumbled the Fox as he walked away with his tail\r\nbetween his legs; but he spoke in a low growl\r\n .\"You may share the labours of the great,\r\nbut you will not share the spoil.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Wolf and the Crane\r\n\r\n\r\nA Wolf had been gorging on an animal he had killed, when\r\nsuddenly a small bone in the meat stuck in his throat and he could\r\nnot swallow it.  He soon felt terrible pain in his throat, and ran\r\nup and down groaning and groaning and seeking for something to\r\nrelieve the pain.  He tried to induce every one he met to remove\r\nthe bone.  \"I would give anything,\" said he, \"if you would take it\r\nout.\"  At last the Crane agreed to try, and told the Wolf to lie\r\non his side and open his jaws as wide as he could.  Then the Crane\r\nput its long neck down the Wolf's throat, and with its beak\r\nloosened the bone, till at last it got it out.\r\n\r\n\"Will you kindly give me the reward you promised?\" said the\r\nCrane.\r\n\r\nThe Wolf grinned and showed his teeth and said: \"Be content.\r\nYou have put your head inside a Wolf's mouth and taken it out\r\nagain in safety; that ought to be reward enough for you.\"\r\n\r\nGratitude and greed go not together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Man and the Serpent\r\n\r\n\r\nA Countryman's son by accident trod upon a Serpent's tail,\r\nwhich turned and bit him so that he died.  The father in a rage\r\ngot his axe, and pursuing the Serpent, cut off part of its tail.\r\nSo the Serpent in revenge began stinging several of the Farmer's\r\ncattle and caused him severe loss.  Well, the Farmer thought it\r\nbest to make it up with the Serpent, and brought food and honey to\r\nthe mouth of its lair, and said to it: \"Let's forget and forgive;\r\nperhaps you were right to punish my son, and take vengeance on my\r\ncattle, but surely I was right in trying to revenge him; now that\r\nwe are both satisfied why should not we be friends again?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said the Serpent; \"take away your gifts; you can\r\nnever forget the death of your son, nor I the loss of my tail.\"\r\n\r\nInjuries may be forgiven, but not forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse\r\n\r\n\r\nNow you must know that a Town Mouse once upon a time went on a\r\nvisit to his cousin in the country.  He was rough and ready, this\r\ncousin, but he loved his town friend and made him heartily\r\nwelcome.  Beans and bacon, cheese and bread, were all he had to\r\noffer, but he offered them freely.  The Town Mouse rather turned\r\nup his long nose at this country fare, and said: \"I cannot\r\nunderstand, Cousin, how you can put up with such poor food as\r\nthis, but of course you cannot expect anything better in the\r\ncountry; come you with me and I will show you how to live.  When\r\nyou have been in town a week you will wonder how you could ever\r\nhave stood a country life.\"  No sooner said than done: the two\r\nmice set off for the town and arrived at the Town Mouse's\r\nresidence late at night.  \"You will want some refreshment after\r\nour long journey,\" said the polite Town Mouse, and took his friend\r\ninto the grand dining-room.  There they found the remains of a\r\nfine feast, and soon the two mice were eating up jellies and cakes\r\nand all that was nice.  Suddenly they heard growling and barking.\r\n\"What is that?\" said the Country Mouse.  \"It is only the dogs of\r\nthe house,\" answered the other.  \"Only!\" said the Country Mouse.\r\n\"I do not like that music at my dinner.\"  Just at that moment the\r\ndoor flew open, in came two huge mastiffs, and the two mice had to\r\nscamper down and run off.  \"Good-bye, Cousin,\" said the Country\r\nMouse, \"What! going so soon?\" said the other.  \"Yes,\" he replied;\r\n\r\n\"Better beans and bacon in peace\r\nthan cakes and ale in fear.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Fox and the Crow\r\n\r\n\r\nA Fox once saw a Crow fly off with a piece of cheese in its\r\nbeak and settle on a branch of a tree.  \"That's for me, as I am a\r\nFox,\" said Master Reynard, and he walked up to the foot of the\r\ntree.  \"Good-day, Mistress Crow,\" he cried.  \"How well you are\r\nlooking to-day: how glossy your feathers; how bright your eye.  I\r\nfeel sure your voice must surpass that of other birds, just as\r\nyour figure does; let me hear but one song from you that I may\r\ngreet you as the Queen of Birds.\"  The Crow lifted up her head and\r\nbegan to caw her best, but the moment she opened her mouth the\r\npiece of cheese fell to the ground, only to be snapped up by\r\nMaster Fox.  \"That will do,\" said he.  \"That was all I wanted.  In\r\nexchange for your cheese I will give you a piece of advice for the\r\nfuture\r\n .\"Do not trust flatterers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Sick Lion\r\n\r\n\r\nA Lion had come to the end of his days and lay sick unto death\r\nat the mouth of his cave, gasping for breath.  The animals, his\r\nsubjects, came round him and drew nearer as he grew more and more\r\nhelpless.  When they saw him on the point of death they thought to\r\nthemselves: \"Now is the time to pay off old grudges.\"  So the Boar\r\ncame up and drove at him with his tusks; then a Bull gored him\r\nwith his horns; still the Lion lay helpless before them: so the\r\nAss, feeling quite safe from danger, came up, and turning his tail\r\nto the Lion kicked up his heels into his face.  \"This is a double\r\ndeath,\" growled the Lion.\r\n\r\nOnly cowards insult dying majesty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Ass and the Lapdog\r\n\r\n\r\nA Farmer one day came to the stables to see to his beasts of\r\nburden: among them was his favourite Ass, that was always well fed\r\nand often carried his master.  With the Farmer came his Lapdog,\r\nwho danced about and licked his hand and frisked about as happy as\r\ncould be.  The Farmer felt in his pocket, gave the Lapdog some\r\ndainty food, and sat down while he gave his orders to his\r\nservants.  The Lapdog jumped into his master's lap, and lay there\r\nblinking while the Farmer stroked his ears.  The Ass, seeing this,\r\nbroke loose from his halter and commenced prancing about in\r\nimitation of the Lapdog.  The Farmer could not hold his sides with\r\nlaughter, so the Ass went up to him, and putting his feet upon the\r\nFarmer's shoulder attempted to climb into his lap.  The Farmer's\r\nservants rushed up with sticks and pitchforks and soon taught the\r\nAss that\r\n .Clumsy jesting is no joke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Lion and the Mouse\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce when a Lion was asleep a little Mouse began running up\r\nand down upon him; this soon wakened the Lion, who placed his huge\r\npaw upon him, and opened his big jaws to swallow him.  \"Pardon, O\r\nKing,\" cried the little Mouse: \"forgive me this time, I shall\r\nnever forget it: who knows but what I may be able to do you a turn\r\nsome of these days?\"  The Lion was so tickled at the idea of the\r\nMouse being able to help him, that he lifted up his paw and let\r\nhim go.  Some time after the Lion was caught in a trap, and the\r\nhunters who desired to carry him alive to the King, tied him to a\r\ntree while they went in search of a waggon to carry him on.  Just\r\nthen the little Mouse happened to pass by, and seeing the sad\r\nplight in which the Lion was, went up to him and soon gnawed away\r\nthe ropes that bound the King of the Beasts.  \"Was I not right?\"\r\nsaid the little Mouse.\r\n\r\nLittle friends may prove great friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Swallow and the Other Birds\r\n\r\n\r\nIt happened that a Countryman was sowing some hemp seeds in a\r\nfield where a Swallow and some other birds were hopping about\r\npicking up their food.  \"Beware of that man,\" quoth the Swallow.\r\n\"Why, what is he doing?\" said the others.  \"That is hemp seed he\r\nis sowing; be careful to pick up every one of the seeds, or else\r\nyou will repent it.\"  The birds paid no heed to the Swallow's\r\nwords, and by and by the hemp grew up and was made into cord, and\r\nof the cords nets were made, and many a bird that had despised the\r\nSwallow's advice was caught in nets made out of that very hemp.\r\n\"What did I tell you?\" said the Swallow.\r\n\r\nDestroy the seed of evil, or it will grow up to your ruin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Frogs Desiring a King\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Frogs were living as happy as could be in a marshy swamp\r\nthat just suited them; they went splashing about caring for nobody\r\nand nobody troubling with them.  But some of them thought that\r\nthis was not right, that they should have a king and a proper\r\nconstitution, so they determined to send up a petition to Jove to\r\ngive them what they wanted.  \"Mighty Jove,\" they cried, \"send unto\r\nus a king that will rule over us and keep us in order.\"  Jove\r\nlaughed at their croaking, and threw down into the swamp a huge\r\nLog, which came down splashing into the swamp.  The Frogs\r\nwere frightened out of their lives by the commotion made in their\r\nmidst, and all rushed to the bank to look at the horrible monster;\r\nbut after a time, seeing that it did not move, one or two of the\r\nboldest of them ventured out towards the Log, and even dared to\r\ntouch it; still it did not move.  Then the greatest hero of the\r\nFrogs jumped upon the Log and commenced dancing up and down upon\r\nit, thereupon all the Frogs came and did the same; and for some\r\ntime the Frogs went about their business every day without taking\r\nthe slightest notice of their new King Log lying in their midst.\r\nBut this did not suit them, so they sent another petition to Jove,\r\nand said to him, \"We want a real king; one that will really rule\r\nover us.\"  Now this made Jove angry, so he sent among them a big\r\nStork that soon set to work gobbling them all up.  Then the Frogs\r\nrepented when too late.\r\n\r\nBetter no rule than cruel rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Mountains in Labour\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day the Countrymen noticed that the Mountains were in\r\nlabour; smoke came out of their summits, the earth was quaking at\r\ntheir feet, trees were crashing, and huge rocks were tumbling.\r\nThey felt sure that something horrible was going to happen.  They\r\nall gathered together in one place to see what terrible thing this\r\ncould be.  They waited and they waited, but nothing came.  At last\r\nthere was a still more violent earthquake, and a huge gap appeared\r\nin the side of the Mountains.  They all fell down upon their knees\r\nand waited.  At last, and at last, a teeny, tiny mouse poked its\r\nlittle head and bristles out of the gap and came running down\r\ntowards them, and ever after they used to say:\r\n\r\n\"Much outcry, little outcome.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Hares and the Frogs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hares were so persecuted by the other beasts, they did not\r\nknow where to go.  As soon as they saw a single animal approach\r\nthem, off they used to run.  One day they saw a troop of wild\r\nHorses stampeding about, and in quite a panic all the Hares\r\nscuttled off to a lake hard by, determined to drown themselves\r\nrather than live in such a continual state of fear.  But just as\r\nthey got near the bank of the lake, a troop of Frogs, frightened\r\nin their turn by the approach of the Hares scuttled off, and\r\njumped into the water.  \"Truly,\" said one of the Hares, \"things\r\nare not so bad as they seem:\r\n\r\n\"There is always someone worse off than yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Wolf and the Kid\r\n\r\n\r\nA Kid was perched up on the top of a house, and looking down\r\nsaw a Wolf passing under him.  Immediately he began to revile and\r\nattack his enemy.  \"Murderer and thief,\" he cried, \"what do you\r\nhere near honest folks' houses?  How dare you make an appearance\r\nwhere your vile deeds are known?\"\r\n\r\n\"Curse away, my young friend,\" said the Wolf.\r\n\r\n\"It is easy to be brave from a safe distance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Woodman and the Serpent\r\n\r\n\r\nOne wintry day a Woodman was tramping home from his work when\r\nhe saw something black lying on the snow.  When he came closer he\r\nsaw it was a Serpent to all appearance dead.  But he took it up\r\nand put it in his bosom to warm while he hurried home.  As soon as\r\nhe got indoors he put the Serpent down on the hearth before the\r\nfire.  The children watched it and saw it slowly come to life\r\nagain.  Then one of them stooped down to stroke it, but the\r\nSerpent raised its head and put out its fangs and was about to\r\nsting the child to death.  So the Woodman seized his axe, and with\r\none stroke cut the Serpent in two.  \"Ah,\" said he,\r\n\r\n\"No gratitude from the wicked.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Bald Man and the Fly\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a Bald Man who sat down after work on a hot\r\nsummer's day.  A Fly came up and kept buzzing about his bald pate,\r\nand stinging him from time to time.  The Man aimed a blow at his\r\nlittle enemy, but acks palm came on his head instead;\r\nagain the Fly tormented him, but this time the Man was wiser and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"You will only injure yourself if you\r\ntake notice of despicable enemies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Fox and the Stork\r\n\r\n\r\nAt one time the Fox and the Stork were on visiting terms and\r\nseemed very good friends.  So the Fox invited the Stork to dinner,\r\nand for a joke put nothing before her but some soup in a very\r\nshallow dish.  This the Fox could easily lap up, but the Stork\r\ncould only wet the end of her long bill in it, and left the meal\r\nas hungry as when she began.  \"I am sorry,\" said the Fox, \"the\r\nsoup is not to your liking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray do not apologise,\" said the Stork.  \"I hope you will\r\nreturn this visit, and come and dine with me soon.\"  So a day was\r\nappointed when the Fox should visit the Stork; but when they were\r\nseated at table all that was for their dinner was contained in a\r\nvery long-necked jar with a narrow mouth, in which the Fox could\r\nnot insert his snout, so all he could manage to do was to lick the\r\noutside of the jar.\r\n\r\n\"I will not apologise for the dinner,\" said the Stork:\r\n\r\n\"One bad turn deserves another.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Fox and the Mask\r\n\r\n\r\nA Fox had by some means got into the store-room of a theatre.\r\nSuddenly he observed a face glaring down on him and began to be\r\nvery frightened; but looking more closely he found it was only a\r\nMask such as actors use to put over their face.  \"Ah,\" said the\r\nFox, \"you look very fine; it is a pity you have not got any\r\nbrains.\"\r\n\r\nOutside show is a poor substitute for inner worth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Jay and the Peacock\r\n\r\n\r\nA Jay venturing into a yard where Peacocks used to walk, found\r\nthere a number of feathers which had fallen from the Peacocks when\r\nthey were moulting.  He tied them all to his tail and strutted\r\ndown towards the Peacocks.  When he came near them they soon\r\ndiscovered the cheat, and striding up to him pecked at him and\r\nplucked away his borrowed plumes.  So the Jay could do no better\r\nthan go back to the other Jays, who had watched his behaviour from\r\na distance; but they were equally annoyed with him, and told him:\r\n\r\n\"It is not only fine feathers that make fine birds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Frog and the Ox\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Oh Father,\" said a little Frog to the big one sitting by the\r\nside of a pool, \"I have seen such a terrible monster!  It was as\r\nbig as a mountain, with horns on its head, and a long tail, and it\r\nhad hoofs divided in two.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tush, child, tush,\" said the old Frog, \"that was only Farmer\r\nWhite's Ox.  It isn't so big either; he may be a little bit taller\r\nthan I, but I could easily make myself quite as broad; just you\r\nsee.\"  So he blew himself out, and blew himself out, and blew\r\nhimself out.  \"Was he as big as that?\" asked he.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, much bigger than that,\" said the young Frog.\r\n\r\nAgain the old one blew himself out, and asked the young one if\r\nthe Ox was as big as that.\r\n\r\n\"Bigger, father, bigger,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nSo the Frog took a deep breath, and blew and blew and blew,\r\nand swelled and swelled and swelled.  And then he said: \"I'm sure\r\nthe Ox is not as big as this.  But at this moment he burst.\r\n\r\nSelf-conceit may lead to self-destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrocles\r\n\r\n\r\nA slave named Androcles once escaped from his master and fled\r\nto the forest.  As he was wandering about there he came upon a\r\nLion lying down moaning and groaning.  At first he turned to flee,\r\nbut finding that the Lion did not pursue him, he turned back and\r\nwent up to him.  As he came near, the Lion put out his paw, which\r\nwas all swollen and bleeding, and Androcles found that a huge\r\nthorn had got into it, and was causing all the pain.  He pulled\r\nout the thorn and bound up the paw of the Lion, who was soon able\r\nto rise and lick the hand of Androcles like a dog.  Then the Lion\r\ntook Androcles to his cave, and every day used to bring him meat\r\nfrom which to live.  But shortly afterwards both Androcles and the\r\nLion were captured, and the slave was sentenced to be thrown to\r\nthe Lion, after the latter had been kept without food for several\r\ndays.  The Emperor and all his Court came to see the spectacle,\r\nand Androcles was led out into the middle of the arena.  Soon the\r\nLion was let loose from his den, and rushed bounding and roaring\r\ntowards his victim.  But as soon as he came near to Androcles he\r\nrecognised his friend, and fawned upon him, and licked his hands\r\nlike a friendly dog.  The Emperor, surprised at this, summoned\r\nAndrocles to him, who told him the whole story.  Whereupon the\r\nslave was pardoned and freed, and the Lion let loose to his native\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nGratitude is the sign of noble souls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bat, the Birds, and the Beasts\r\n\r\n\r\nA great conflict was about to come off between the Birds and\r\nthe Beasts.  When the two armies were collected together the Bat\r\nhesitated which to join.  The Birds that passed his perch said:\r\n\"Come with us\"; but he said: \"I am a Beast.\"  Later on, some\r\nBeasts who were passing underneath him looked up and said: \"Come\r\nwith us\"; but he said: \"I am a Bird.\"  Luckily at the last moment\r\npeace was made, and no battle took place, so the Bat came to the\r\nBirds and wished to join in the rejoicings, but they all turned\r\nagainst him and he had to fly away.  He then went to the Beasts,\r\nbut soon had to beat a retreat, or else they would have torn him\r\nto pieces.  \"Ah,\" said the Bat, \"I see now,\r\n\r\n\"He that is neither one thing nor the other has no friends.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hart and the Hunter\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hart was once drinking from a pool and admiring the noble\r\nfigure he made there.  \"Ah,\" said he, \"where can you see such\r\nnoble horns as these, with such antlers!  I wish I had legs more\r\nworthy to bear such a noble crown; it is a pity they are so slim\r\nand slight.\"  At that moment a Hunter approached and sent an arrow\r\nwhistling after him.  Away bounded the Hart, and soon, by the aid\r\nof his nimble legs, was nearly out of sight of the Hunter; but not\r\nnoticing where he was going, he passed under some trees with\r\nbranches growing low down in which his antlers were caught, so\r\nthat the Hunter had time to come up.  \"Alas! alas!\" cried the\r\nHart:\r\n\r\n\"We often despise what is most useful to us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Serpent and the File\r\n\r\n\r\nA Serpent in the course of its wanderings came into an\r\narmourer's shop.  As he glided over the floor he felt his skin\r\npricked by a file lying there.  In a rage he turned round upon it\r\nand tried to dart his fangs into it; but he could do no harm to\r\nheavy iron and had soon to give over his wrath.\r\n\r\nIt is useless attacking the insensible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Man and the Wood\r\n\r\n\r\nA Man came into a Wood one day with an axe in his hand, and\r\nbegged all the Trees to give him a small branch which he wanted\r\nfor a particular purpose.  The Trees were good-natured and gave\r\nhim one of their branches.  What did the Man do but fix it into\r\nthe axe head, and soon set to work cutting down tree after tree.\r\nThen the Trees saw how foolish they had been in giving their enemy\r\nthe means of destroying themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Dog and the Wolf\r\n\r\n\r\nA gaunt Wolf was almost dead with hunger when he happened to\r\nmeet a House-dog who was passing by.  \"Ah, Cousin,\" said the Dog.\r\n\"I knew how it would be; your irregular life will soon be the ruin\r\nof you.  Why do you not work steadily as I do, and get your food\r\nregularly given to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would have no objection,\" said the Wolf, \"if I could only\r\nget a place.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will easily arrange that for you,\" said the Dog; \"come with\r\nme to my master and you shall share my work.\"\r\n\r\nSo the Wolf and the Dog went towards the town together.  On\r\nthe way there the Wolf noticed that the hair on a certain part of\r\nthe Dog's neck was very much worn away, so he asked him how that\r\nhad come about.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it is nothing,\" said the Dog.  \"That is only the place\r\nwhere the collar is put on at night to keep me chained up; it\r\nchafes a bit, but one soon gets used to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\" said the Wolf.  \"Then good-bye to you, Master\r\nDog.\"\r\n\r\nBetter starve free than be a fat slave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Belly and the Members\r\n\r\n\r\nOne fine day it occurred to the Members of the Body that they\r\nwere doing all the work and the Belly was having all the food.  So\r\nthey held a meeting, and after a long discussion, decided to\r\nstrike work till the Belly consented to take its proper share of\r\nthe work.  So for a day or two, the Hands refused to take the\r\nfood, the Mouth refused to receive it, and the Teeth had no work\r\nto do.  But after a day or two the Members began to find that they\r\nthemselves were not in a very active condition: the Hands could\r\nhardly move, and the Mouth was all parched and dry, while the Legs\r\nwere unable to support the rest.  So thus they found that even the\r\nBelly in its dull quiet way was doing necessary work for the Body,\r\nand that all must work together or the Body will go to pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Hart in the Ox-Stall\r\n\r\n\r\nA Hart hotly pursued by the hounds fled for refuge into an\r\nox-stall, and buried itself in a truss of hay, leaving nothing to\r\nbe seen but the tips of his horns.  Soon after the Hunters came up\r\nand asked if any one had seen the Hart.  The stable boys, who had\r\nbeen resting after their dinner, looked round, but could see\r\nnothing, and the Hunters went away.  Shortly afterwards the master\r\ncame in, and looking round, saw that something unusual had taken\r\nplace.  He pointed to the truss of hay and said: \"What are those\r\ntwo curious things sticking out of the hay?\"  And when the stable\r\nboys came to look they discovered the Hart, and soon made an end\r\nof him.  He thus learnt that\r\nNothing escapes the master's eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Fox and the Grapes\r\n\r\n\r\nOne hot summer's day a Fox was strolling through an orchard\r\ntill he came to a bunch of Grapes just ripening on a vine which\r\nhad been trained over a lofty branch.  \"Just the thing to quench\r\nmy thirst,\" quoth he.  Drawing back a few paces, he took a run and\r\na jump, and just missed the bunch.  Turning round again with a\r\nOne, Two, Three, he jumped up, but with no greater success.  Again\r\nand again he tried after the tempting morsel, but at last had to\r\ngive it up, and walked away with his nose in the air, saying: \"I\r\nam sure they are sour.\"\r\n\r\nIt is easy to despise what you cannot get.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Horse, Hunter, and Stag\r\n\r\n\r\nA quarrel had arisen between the Horse and the Stag, so the\r\nHorse came to a Hunter to ask his help to take revenge on the\r\nStag.  The Hunter agreed, but said: \"If you desire to conquer the\r\nStag, you must permit me to place this piece of iron between your\r\njaws, so that I may guide you with these reins, and allow this\r\nsaddle to be placed upon your back so that I may keep steady upon\r\nyou as we follow after the enemy.\"  The Horse agreed to the\r\nconditions, and the Hunter soon saddled and bridled him.  Then\r\nwith the aid of the Hunter the Horse soon overcame the Stag, and\r\nsaid to the Hunter: \"Now, get off, and remove those things from my\r\nmouth and back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so fast, friend,\" said the Hunter.  \"I have now got you\r\nunder bit and spur, and prefer to keep you as you are at present.\"\r\n\r\nIf you allow men to use you for your own purposes,\r\nthey will use you for theirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Peacock and Juno\r\n\r\n\r\nA Peacock once placed a petition before Juno desiring to have\r\nthe voice of a nightingale in addition to his other attractions;\r\nbut Juno refused his request.  When he persisted, and pointed out\r\nthat he was her favourite bird, she said:\r\n\r\n\"Be content with your lot;\r\none cannot be first in everything.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Fox and the Lion\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen first the Fox saw the Lion he was terribly frightened,\r\nand ran away and hid himself in the wood.  Next time however he\r\ncame near the King of Beasts he stopped at a safe distance and\r\nwatched him pass by.  The third time they came near one another\r\nthe Fox went straight up to the Lion and passed the time of day\r\nwith him, asking him how his family were, and when he should have\r\nthe pleasure of seeing him again; then turning his tail, he parted\r\nfrom the Lion without much ceremony.\r\n\r\nFamiliarity breeds contempt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Lion and the Statue\r\n\r\n\r\nA Man and a Lion were discussing the relative strength of men\r\nand lions in general.  The Man contended that he and his fellows\r\nwere stronger than lions by reason of their greater intelligence.\r\n\"Come now with me,\" he cried, \"and I will soon prove that I am\r\nright.\"  So he took him into the public gardens and showed him a\r\nstatue of Hercules overcoming the Lion and tearing his mouth in\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\n\"That is all very well,\" said the Lion, \"but proves nothing,\r\nfor it was a man who made the statue.\"\r\n\r\nWe can easily represent things as we wish them to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Ant and the Grasshopper\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a field one summer's day a Grasshopper was hopping about,\r\nchirping and singing to its heart's content.  An Ant passed by,\r\nbearing along with great toil an ear of corn he was taking to the\r\nnest.\r\n\r\n\"Why not come and chat with me,\" said the Grasshopper,\r\n\"instead of toiling and moiling in that way?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am helping to lay up food for the winter,\" said the Ant,\r\n\"and recommend you to do the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why bother about winter?\" said the Grasshopper; we have got\r\nplenty of food at present.\"  But the Ant went on its way and\r\ncontinued its toil.  When the winter came the Grasshopper had no\r\nfood and found itself dying of hunger, while it saw the ants\r\ndistributing every day corn and grain from the stores they had\r\ncollected in the summer.  Then the Grasshopper knew:\r\n\r\nIt is best to prepare for the days of necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Tree and the Reed\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, little one,\" said a Tree to a Reed that was growing at\r\nits foot, \"why do you not plant your feet deeply in the ground,\r\nand raise your head boldly in the air as I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am contented with my lot,\" said the Reed.  \"I may not be so\r\ngrand, but I think I am safer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Safe!\" sneered the Tree.  \"Who shall pluck me up by the roots\r\nor bow my head to the ground?\"  But it soon had to repent of its\r\nboasting, for a hurricane arose which tore it up from its roots,\r\nand cast it a useless log on the ground, while the little Reed,\r\nbending to the force of the wind, soon stood upright again when\r\nthe storm had passed over.\r\n\r\nObscurity often brings safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Fox and the Cat\r\n\r\n\r\nA Fox was boasting to a Cat of its clever devices for escaping\r\nits enemies.  \"I have a whole bag of tricks,\" he said, \"which\r\ncontains a hundred ways of escaping my enemies.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have only one,\" said the Cat; \"but I can generally manage\r\nwith that.\"  Just at that moment they heard the cry of a pack of\r\nhounds coming towards them, and the Cat immediately scampered up a\r\ntree and hid herself in the boughs.  \"This is my plan,\" said the\r\nCat.  \"What are you going to do?\"  The Fox thought first of one\r\nway, then of another, and while he was debating the hounds came\r\nnearer and nearer, and at last the Fox in his confusion was caught\r\nup by the hounds and soon killed by the huntsmen.  Miss Puss, who\r\nhad been looking on, said:\r\n\r\n\"Better one safe way than a hundred on which\r\nyou cannot reckon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing\r\n\r\n\r\nA Wolf found great difficulty in getting at the sheep owing to\r\nthe vigilance of the shepherd and his dogs.  But one day it found\r\nthe skin of a sheep that had been flayed and thrown aside, so it\r\nput it on over its own pelt and strolled down among the sheep.\r\nThe Lamb that belonged to the sheep, whose skin the Wolf was\r\nwearing, began to follow the Wolf in the Sheep's clothing; so,\r\nleading the Lamb a little apart, he soon made a meal off her, and\r\nfor some time he succeeded in deceiving the sheep, and enjoying\r\nhearty meals.\r\n\r\nAppearances are deceptive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Dog in the Manger\r\n\r\n\r\nA Dog looking out for its afternoon nap jumped into the Manger\r\nof an Ox and lay there cosily upon the straw.  But soon the Ox,\r\nreturning from its afternoon work, came up to the Manger and\r\nwanted to eat some of the straw.  The Dog in a rage, being\r\nawakened from its slumber, stood up and barked at the Ox, and\r\nwhenever it came near attempted to bite it.  At last the Ox had to\r\ngive up the hope of getting at the straw, and went away muttering:\r\n\r\n\"Ah, people often grudge others what they\r\ncannot enjoy themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Man and the Wooden God\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the old days men used to worship sticks and stones and\r\nidols, and prayed to them to give them luck.  It happened that a\r\nMan had often prayed to a wooden idol he had received from his\r\nfather, but his luck never seemed to change.  He prayed and he\r\nprayed, but still he remained as unlucky as ever.  One day in the\r\ngreatest rage he went to the Wooden God, and with one blow swept\r\nit down from its pedestal.  The idol broke in two, and what did he\r\nsee?  An immense number of coins flying all over the place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Fisher\r\n\r\n\r\nA Fisher once took his bagpipes to the bank of a river, and\r\nplayed upon them with the hope of making the fish rise; but never\r\na one put his nose out of the water.  So he cast his net into the\r\nriver and soon drew it forth filled with fish.  Then he took his\r\nbagpipes again, and, as he played, the fish leapt up in the net.\r\n\"Ah, you dance now when I play,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said an old Fish:\r\n\r\n\"When you are in a man's power you must do as he bids you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Shepherd's Boy\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a young Shepherd Boy who tended his sheep at\r\nthe foot of a mountain near a dark forest.  It was rather lonely\r\nfor him all day, so he thought upon a plan by which he could get a\r\nlittle company and some excitement.  He rushed down towards the\r\nvillage calling out \"Wolf, Wolf,\" and the villagers came out to\r\nmeet him, and some of them stopped with him for a considerable\r\ntime.  This pleased the boy so much that a few days afterwards he\r\ntried the same trick, and again the villagers came to his help.\r\nBut shortly after this a Wolf actually did come out from the\r\nforest, and began to worry the sheep, and the boy of course cried\r\nout \"Wolf, Wolf,\" still louder than before.  But this time the\r\nvillagers, who had been fooled twice before, thought the boy was\r\nagain deceiving them, and nobody stirred to come to his help.  So\r\nthe Wolf made a good meal off the boy's flock, and when the boy\r\ncomplained, the wise man of the village said:\r\n\r\n\"A liar will not be believed, even when he speaks the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Young Thief and His Mother\r\n\r\n\r\nA young Man had been caught in a daring act of theft and had\r\nbeen condemned to be executed for it.  He expressed his desire to\r\nsee his Mother, and to speak with her before he was led to\r\nexecution, and of course this was granted.  When his Mother came\r\nto him he said: \"I want to whisper to you,\" and when she brought\r\nher ear near him, he nearly bit it off.  All the bystanders were\r\nhorrified, and asked him what he could mean by such brutal and\r\ninhuman conduct.  \"It is to punish her,\" he said.  \"When I was\r\nyoung I began with stealing little things, and brought them home\r\nto Mother.  Instead of rebuking and punishing me, she laughed and\r\nsaid: \"It will not be noticed.\"  It is because of her that I am\r\nhere to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is right, woman,\" said the Priest; \"the Lord hath said:\r\n\r\n\"Train up a child in the way he should go; and\r\nwhen he is old he will not depart therefrom.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Man and His Two Wives\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the old days, when men were allowed to have many wives, a\r\nmiddle-aged Man had one wife that was old and one that was young;\r\neach loved him very much, and desired to see him like herself.\r\nNow the Man's hair was turning grey, which the young Wife did not\r\nlike, as it made him look too old for her husband.  So every night\r\nshe used to comb his hair and pick out the white ones.  But the\r\nelder Wife saw her husband growing grey with great pleasure, for\r\nshe did not like to be mistaken for his mother.  So every morning\r\nshe used to arrange his hair and pick out as many of the black\r\nones as she could.  The consequence was the Man soon found himself\r\nentirely bald.\r\n\r\nYield to all and you will soon have nothing to yield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Nurse and the Wolf\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Be quiet now,\" said an old Nurse to a child sitting on her\r\nlap.  \"If you make that noise again I will throw you to the Wolf.\"\r\n\r\nNow it chanced that a Wolf was passing close under the window\r\nas this was said.  So he crouched down by the side of the house\r\nand waited.  \"I am in good luck to-day,\" thought he.  \"It is sure\r\nto cry soon, and a daintier morsel I haven't had for many a long\r\nday.\"  So he waited, and he waited, and he waited, till at last\r\nthe child began to cry, and the Wolf came forward before the\r\nwindow, and looked up to the Nurse, wagging his tail.  But all the\r\nNurse did was to shut down the window and call for help, and the\r\ndogs of the house came rushing out.  \"Ah,\" said the Wolf as he\r\ngalloped away,\r\n\r\n\"Enemies promises were made to be broken.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Tortoise and the Birds\r\n\r\n\r\nA Tortoise desired to change its place of residence, so he\r\nasked an Eagle to carry him to his new home, promising her a rich\r\nreward for her trouble.  The Eagle agreed and seizing the Tortoise\r\nby the shell with her talons soared aloft.  On their way they met\r\na Crow, who said to the Eagle: \"Tortoise is good eating.\"  \"The\r\nshell is too hard,\" said the Eagle in reply.  \"The rocks will soon\r\ncrack the shell,\" was the Crow's answer; and the Eagle, taking the\r\nhint, let fall the Tortoise on a sharp rock, and the two birds\r\nmade a hearty meal of the Tortoise.\r\n\r\nNever soar aloft on an enemy's pinions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Two Crabs\r\n\r\n\r\nOne fine day two Crabs came out from their home to take a\r\nstroll on the sand.  \"Child,\" said the mother, \"you are walking\r\nvery ungracefully.  You should accustom yourself, to walking\r\nstraight forward without twisting from side to side.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray, mother,\" said the young one, \"do but set the example\r\nyourself, and I will follow you.\"\r\n\r\nExample is the best precept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Ass in the Lion's Skin\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Ass once found a Lion's skin which the hunters had left out\r\nin the sun to dry.  He put it on and went towards his native\r\nvillage.  All fled at his approach, both men and animals, and he\r\nwas a proud Ass that day.  In his delight he lifted up his voice\r\nand brayed, but then every one knew him, and his owner came up and\r\ngave him a sound cudgelling for the fright he had caused.  And\r\nshortly afterwards a Fox came up to him and said: \"Ah, I knew you\r\nby your voice.\"\r\n\r\nFine clothes may disguise, but\r\nsilly words will disclose a fool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Two Fellows and the Bear\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo Fellows were travelling together through a wood, when a\r\nBear rushed out upon them.  One of the travellers happened to be\r\nin front, and he seized hold of the branch of a tree, and hid\r\nhimself among the leaves.  The other, seeing no help for it, threw\r\nhimself flat down upon the ground, with his face in the dust.  The\r\nBear, coming up to him, put his muzzle close to his ear, and\r\nsniffed and sniffed.  But at last with a growl he shook his head\r\nand slouched off, for bears will not touch dead meat.  Then the\r\nfellow in the tree came down to his comrade, and, laughing, said\r\n\"What was it that Master Bruin whispered to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"He told me,\" said the other,\r\n\r\n\"Never trust a friend who deserts you at a pinch.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Two Pots\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo Pots had been left on the bank of a river, one of brass,\r\nand one of earthenware.  When the tide rose they both floated off\r\ndown the stream.  Now the earthenware pot tried its best to keep\r\naloof from the brass one, which cried out: \"Fear nothing, friend,\r\nI will not strike you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I may come in contact with you,\" said the other, \"if I\r\ncome too close; and whether I hit you, or you hit me, I shall\r\nsuffer for it.\"\r\n\r\nThe strong and the weak cannot keep company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Four Oxen and the Lion\r\n\r\n\r\nA Lion used to prowl about a field in which Four Oxen used to\r\ndwell.  Many a time he tried to attack them; but whenever he came\r\nnear they turned their tails to one another, so that whichever way\r\nhe approached them he was met by the horns of one of them.  At\r\nlast, however, they fell a-quarrelling among themselves, and each\r\nwent off to pasture alone in a separate corner of the field.  Then\r\nthe Lion attacked them one by one and soon made an end of all\r\nfour.\r\n\r\nUnited we stand, divided we fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Fisher and the Little Fish\r\n\r\n\r\nIt happened that a Fisher, after fishing all day, caught only\r\na little fish.  \"Pray, let me go, master,\" said the Fish.  \"I am\r\nmuch too small for your eating just now.  If you put me back into\r\nthe river I shall soon grow, then you can make a fine meal off\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, nay, my little Fish,\" said the Fisher, \"I have you now.\r\nI may not catch you hereafter.\"\r\n\r\nA little thing in hand is worth more than\r\na great thing in prospect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Avaricious and Envious\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo neighbours came before Jupiter and prayed him to grant\r\ntheir hearts' desire.  Now the one was full of avarice, and the\r\nother eaten up with envy.  So to punish them both, Jupiter granted\r\nthat each might have whatever he wished for himself, but only on\r\ncondition that his neighbour had twice as much.  The Avaricious\r\nman prayed to have a room full of gold.  No sooner said than done;\r\nbut all his joy was turned to grief when he found that his\r\nneighbour had two rooms full of the precious metal.  Then came the\r\nturn of the Envious man, who could not bear to think that his\r\nneighbour had any joy at all.  So he prayed that he might have one\r\nof his own eyes put out, by which means his companion would become\r\ntotally blind.\r\n\r\nVices are their own punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Crow and the Pitcher\r\n\r\n\r\nA Crow, half-dead with thirst, came upon a Pitcher which had\r\nonce been full of water; but when the Crow put its beak into the\r\nmouth of the Pitcher he found that only very little water was left\r\nin it, and that he could not reach far enough down to get at it.\r\nHe tried, and he tried, but at last had to give up in despair.\r\nThen a thought came to him, and he took a pebble and dropped it\r\ninto the Pitcher.  Then he took another pebble and dropped it into\r\nthe Pitcher.  Then he took another pebble and dropped that into\r\nthe Pitcher.  Then he took another pebble and dropped that into\r\nthe Pitcher.  Then he took another pebble and dropped that into\r\nthe Pitcher.  Then he took another pebble and dropped that into\r\nthe Pitcher.  At last, at last, he saw the water mount up near\r\nhim, and after casting in a few more pebbles he was able to quench\r\nhis thirst and save his life.\r\n\r\nLittle by little does the trick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Man and the Satyr\r\n\r\n\r\nA Man had lost his way in a wood one bitter winter's night.\r\nAs he was roaming about, a Satyr came up to him, and finding that\r\nhe had lost his way, promised to give him a lodging for the night,\r\nand guide him out of the forest in the morning.  As he went along\r\nto the Satyr's cell, the Man raised both his hands to his mouth\r\nand kept on blowing at them.  \"What do you do that for?\" said the\r\nSatyr.\r\n\r\n\"My hands are numb with the cold,\" said the Man, \"and my\r\nbreath warms them.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this they arrived at the Satyr's home, and soon the\r\nSatyr put a smoking dish of porridge before him.  But when the Man\r\nraised his spoon to his mouth he began blowing upon it.  \"And what\r\ndo you do that for?\" said the Satyr.\r\n\r\n\"The porridge is too hot, and my breath will cool it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Out you go,\" said the Satyr.  \"I will have nought to do with\r\na man who can blow hot and cold with the same breath.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Goose With the Golden Eggs\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day a countryman going to the nest of his Goose found\r\nthere an egg all yellow and glittering.  When he took it up it was\r\nas heavy as lead and he was going to throw it away, because he\r\nthought a trick had been played upon him.  But he took it home on\r\nsecond thoughts, and soon found to his delight that it was an egg\r\nof pure gold.  Every morning the same thing occurred, and he soon\r\nbecame rich by selling his eggs.  As he grew rich he grew greedy;\r\nand thinking to get at once all the gold the Goose could give, he\r\nkilled it and opened it only to find nothing.\r\n\r\nGreed oft o'er reaches itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Labourer and the Nightingale\r\n\r\n\r\nA Labourer lay listening to a Nightingale's song throughout\r\nthe summer night.  So pleased was he with it that the next night\r\nhe set a trap for it and captured it.  \"Now that I have caught\r\nthee,\" he cried, \"thou shalt always sing to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"We Nightingales never sing in a cage.\" said the bird.\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll eat thee.\" said the Labourer.  \"I have always heard\r\nsay that a nightingale on toast is dainty morsel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, kill me not,\" said the Nightingale; \"but let me free,\r\nand I'll tell thee three things far better worth than my poor\r\nbody.\"  The Labourer let him loose, and he flew up to a branch of\r\na tree and said: \"Never believe a captive's promise; that's one\r\nthing.  Then again: Keep what you have.  And third piece of advice\r\nis: Sorrow not over what is lost forever.\"  Then the song-bird\r\nflew away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Fox, the Cock, and the Dog\r\n\r\n\r\nOne moonlight night a Fox was prowling about a farmer's\r\nhen-coop, and saw a Cock roosting high up beyond his reach.  \"Good\r\nnews, good news!\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"Why, what is that?\" said the Cock.\r\n\r\n\"King Lion has declared a universal truce.  No beast may hurt\r\na bird henceforth, but all shall dwell together in brotherly\r\nfriendship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that is good news,\" said the Cock; \"and there I see some\r\none coming, with whom we can share the good tidings.\"  And so\r\nsaying he craned his neck forward and looked afar off.\r\n\r\n\"What is it you see?\" said the Fox.\r\n\r\n\"It is only my master's Dog that is coming towards us.  What,\r\ngoing so soon?\" he continued, as the Fox began to turn away as\r\nsoon as he had heard the news.  \"Will you not stop and\r\ncongratulate the Dog on the reign of universal peace?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would gladly do so,\" said the Fox, \"but I fear he may not\r\nhave heard of King Lion's decree.\"\r\n\r\nCunning often outwits itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Wind and the Sun\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger.\r\nSuddenly they saw a traveller coming down the road, and the Sun\r\nsaid: \"I see a way to decide our dispute.  Whichever of us can\r\ncause that traveller to take off his cloak shall be regarded as\r\nthe stronger.  You begin.\"  So the Sun retired behind a cloud, and\r\nthe Wind began to blow as hard as it could upon the traveller.\r\nBut the harder he blew the more closely did the traveller wrap his\r\ncloak round him, till at last the Wind had to give up in despair.\r\nThen the Sun came out and shone in all his glory upon the\r\ntraveller, who soon found it too hot to walk with his cloak on.\r\n\r\nKindness effects more than severity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hercules and the Waggoner\r\n\r\n\r\nA Waggoner was once driving a heavy load along a very muddy\r\nway.  At last he came to a part of the road where the wheels sank\r\nhalf-way into the mire, and the more the horses pulled, the deeper\r\nsank the wheels.  So the Waggoner threw down his whip, and knelt\r\ndown and prayed to Hercules the Strong.  \"O Hercules, help me in\r\nthis my hour of distress,\" quoth he.  But Hercules appeared to\r\nhim, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Tut, man, don't sprawl there.  Get up and put your shoulder\r\nto the wheel.\"\r\n\r\nThe gods help them that help themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Man, the Boy, and the Donkey\r\n\r\n\r\nA Man and his son were once going with their Donkey to market.\r\nAs they were walking along by its side a countryman passed them\r\nand said: \"You fools, what is a Donkey for but to ride upon?\"\r\n\r\nSo the Man put the Boy on the Donkey and they went on their\r\nway.  But soon they passed a group of men, one of whom said: \"See\r\nthat lazy youngster, he lets his father walk while he rides.\"\r\n\r\nSo the Man ordered his Boy to get off, and got on himself.\r\nBut they hadn't gone far when they passed two women, one of whom\r\nsaid to the other: \"Shame on that lazy lout to let his poor little\r\nson trudge along.\"\r\n\r\nWell, the Man didn't know what to do, but at last he took his\r\nBoy up before him on the Donkey.  By this time they had come to\r\nthe town, and the passers-by began to jeer and point at them.  The\r\nMan stopped and asked what they were scoffing at.  The men said:\r\n\"Aren't you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey\r\nof yours and your hulking son?\"\r\n\r\nThe Man and Boy got off and tried to think what to do.  They\r\nthought and they thought, till at last they cut down a pole, tied\r\nthe donkey's feet to it, and raised the pole and the donkey to\r\ntheir shoulders.  They went along amid the laughter of all who met\r\nthem till they came to Market Bridge, when the Donkey, getting one\r\nof his feet loose, kicked out and caused the Boy to drop his end\r\nof the pole.  In the struggle the Donkey fell over the bridge, and\r\nhis fore-feet being tied together he was drowned.\r\n\r\n\"That will teach you,\" said an old man who had followed them:\r\n\r\n\"Please all, and you will please none.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Miser and His Gold\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there was a Miser who used to hide his gold\r\nat the foot of a tree in his garden; but every week he used to go\r\nand dig it up and gloat over his gains.  A robber, who had noticed\r\nthis, went and dug up the gold and decamped with it.  When the\r\nMiser next came to gloat over his treasures, he found nothing but\r\nthe empty hole.  He tore his hair, and raised such an outcry that\r\nall the neighbours came around him, and he told them how he used\r\nto come and visit his gold.  \"Did you ever take any of it out?\"\r\nasked one of them.\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" said he, \"I only came to look at it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then come again and look at the hole,\" said a neighbour; \"it\r\nwill do you just as much good.\"\r\n\r\nWealth unused might as well not exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Fox and the Mosquitoes\r\n\r\n\r\nA Fox after crossing a river got its tail entangled in a bush,\r\nand could not move.  A number of Mosquitoes seeing its plight\r\nsettled upon it and enjoyed a good meal undisturbed by its tail.\r\nA hedgehog strolling by took pity upon the Fox and went up to him:\r\n\"You are in a bad way, neighbour,\" said the hedgehog; \"shall I\r\nrelieve you by driving off those Mosquitoes who are sucking your\r\nblood?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Master Hedgehog,\" said the Fox, \"but I would\r\nrather not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, how is that?\" asked the hedgehog.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see,\" was the answer, \"these Mosquitoes have had\r\ntheir fill; if you drive these away, others will come with fresh\r\nappetite and bleed me to death.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Fox Without a Tail\r\n\r\n\r\nIt happened that a Fox caught its tail in a trap, and in\r\nstruggling to release himself lost all of it but the stump.  At\r\nfirst he was ashamed to show himself among his fellow foxes.  But\r\nat last he determined to put a bolder face upon his misfortune,\r\nand summoned all the foxes to a general meeting to consider a\r\nproposal which he had to place before them.  When they had\r\nassembled together the Fox proposed that they should all do away\r\nwith their tails.  He pointed out how inconvenient a tail was when\r\nthey were pursued by their enemies, the dogs; how much it was in\r\nthe way when they desired to sit down and hold a friendly\r\nconversation with one another.  He failed to see any advantage in\r\ncarrying about such a useless encumbrance.  \"That is all very\r\nwell,\" said one of the older foxes; \"but I do not think you would\r\nhave recommended us to dispense with our chief ornament if you had\r\nnot happened to lose it yourself.\"\r\n\r\nDistrust interested advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The One-Eyed Doe\r\n\r\n\r\nA Doe had had the misfortune to lose one of her eyes, and\r\ncould not see any one approaching her on that side.  So to avoid\r\nany danger she always used to feed on a high cliff near the sea,\r\nwith her sound eye looking towards the land.  By this means she\r\ncould see whenever the hunters approached her on land, and often\r\nescaped by this means.  But the hunters found out that she was\r\nblind of one eye, and hiring a boat rowed under the cliff where\r\nshe used to feed and shot her from the sea.  \"Ah,\" cried she with\r\nher dying voice,\r\n\r\n\"You cannot escape your fate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Belling the Cat\r\n\r\n\r\nLong ago, the mice had a general council to consider what\r\nmeasures they could take to outwit their common enemy, the Cat.\r\nSome said this, and some said that; but at last a young mouse got\r\nup and said he had a proposal to make, which he thought would meet\r\nthe case.  \"You will all agree,\" said he, \"that our chief danger\r\nconsists in the sly and treacherous manner in which the enemy\r\napproaches us.  Now, if we could receive some signal of her\r\napproach, we could easily escape from her.  I venture, therefore,\r\nto propose that a small bell be procured, and attached by a ribbon\r\nround the neck of the Cat.  By this means we should always know\r\nwhen she was about, and could easily retire while she was in the\r\nneighbourhood.\"\r\n\r\nThis proposal met with general applause, until an old mouse\r\ngot up and said: \"That is all very well, but who is to bell the\r\nCat?\"  The mice looked at one another and nobody spoke.  Then the\r\nold mouse said:\r\n\r\n\"It is easy to propose impossible remedies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Hare and the Tortoise\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hare was once boasting of his speed before the other\r\nanimals.  \"I have never yet been beaten,\" said he, \"when I put\r\nforth my full speed.  I challenge any one here to race with me.\"\r\n\r\nThe Tortoise said quietly, \"I accept your challenge.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a good joke,\" said the Hare; \"I could dance round you\r\nall the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep your boasting till you've beaten,\" answered the\r\nTortoise.  \"Shall we race?\"\r\n\r\nSo a course was fixed and a start was made.  The Hare darted\r\nalmost out of sight at once, but soon stopped and, to show his\r\ncontempt for the Tortoise, lay down to have a nap.  The Tortoise\r\nplodded on and plodded on, and when the Hare awoke from his nap,\r\nhe saw the Tortoise just near the winning-post and could not run\r\nup in time to save the race.  Then said the Tortoise:\r\n\r\n\"Plodding wins the race.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Old Man and Death\r\n\r\n\r\nAn old labourer, bent double with age and toil, was gathering\r\nsticks in a forest.  At last he grew so tired and hopeless that he\r\nthrew down the bundle of sticks, and cried out: \"I cannot bear\r\nthis life any longer.  Ah, I wish Death would only come and take\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, Death, a grisly skeleton, appeared and said to\r\nhim: \"What wouldst thou, Mortal?  I heard thee call me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir,\" replied the woodcutter, \"would you kindly help\r\nme to lift this faggot of sticks on to my shoulder?\"\r\n\r\nWe would often be sorry if our wishes were gratified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Hare With Many Friends\r\n\r\n\r\nA Hare was very popular with the other beasts who all claimed\r\nto be her friends.  But one day she heard the hounds approaching\r\nand hoped to escape them by the aid of her many Friends.  So, she\r\nwent to the horse, and asked him to carry her away from the hounds\r\non his back.  But he declined, stating that he had important work\r\nto do for his master.  \"He felt sure,\" he said, \"that all her\r\nother friends would come to her assistance.\"  She then applied to\r\nthe bull, and hoped that he would repel the hounds with his horns.\r\nThe bull replied: \"I am very sorry, but I have an appointment with\r\na lady; but I feel sure that our friend the goat will do what you\r\nwant.\"  The goat, however, feared that his back might do her some\r\nharm if he took her upon it.  The ram, he felt sure, was the\r\nproper friend to apply to.  So she went to the ram and told him\r\nthe case.  The ram replied: \"Another time, my dear friend.  I do\r\nnot like to interfere on the present occasion, as hounds have been\r\nknown to eat sheep as well as hares.\"  The Hare then applied, as a\r\nlast hope, to the calf, who regretted that he was unable to help\r\nher, as he did not like to take the responsibility upon himself,\r\nas so many older persons than himself had declined the task.  By\r\nthis time the hounds were quite near, and the Hare took to her\r\nheels and luckily escaped.\r\n\r\nHe that has many friends, has no friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Lion in Love\r\n\r\n\r\nA Lion once fell in love with a beautiful maiden and proposed\r\nmarriage to her parents.  The old people did not know what to say.\r\nThey did not like to give their daughter to the Lion, yet they did\r\nnot wish to enrage the King of Beasts.  At last the father said:\r\n\"We feel highly honoured by your Majesty's proposal, but you see\r\nour daughter is a tender young thing, and we fear that in the\r\nvehemence of your affection you might possibly do her some injury.\r\nMight I venture to suggest that your Majesty should have your\r\nclaws removed, and your teeth extracted, then we would gladly\r\nconsider your proposal again.\"  The Lion was so much in love that\r\nhe had his claws trimmed and his big teeth taken out.  But when he\r\ncame again to the parents of the young girl they simply laughed in\r\nhis face, and bade him do his worst.\r\n\r\nLove can tame the wildest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Bundle of Sticks\r\n\r\n\r\nAn old man on the point of death summoned his sons around him\r\nto give them some parting advice.  He ordered his servants to\r\nbring in a faggot of sticks, and said to his eldest son: \"Break\r\nit.\"  The son strained and strained, but with all his efforts was\r\nunable to break the Bundle.  The other sons also tried, but none\r\nof them was successful.  \"Untie the faggots,\" said the father,\r\n\"and each of you take a stick.\"  When they had done so, he called\r\nout to them: \"Now, break,\" and each stick was easily broken.  \"You\r\nsee my meaning,\" said their father.\r\n\r\nUnion gives strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Lion, the Fox, and the Beasts\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion once gave out that he was sick unto death and\r\nsummoned the animals to come and hear his last Will and Testament.\r\nSo the Goat came to the Lion's cave, and stopped there listening\r\nfor a long time.  Then a Sheep went in, and before she came out a\r\nCalf came up to receive the last wishes of the Lord of the Beasts.\r\nBut soon the Lion seemed to recover, and came to the mouth of his\r\ncave, and saw the Fox, who had been waiting outside for some time.\r\n\"Why do you not come to pay your respects to me?\" said the Lion to\r\nthe Fox.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your Majesty's pardon,\" said the Fox, \"but I noticed\r\nthe track of the animals that have already come to you; and while\r\nI see many hoof-marks going in, I see none coming out.  Till the\r\nanimals that have entered your cave come out again I prefer to\r\nremain in the open air.\"\r\n\r\nIt is easier to get into the enemy's toils than out again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Ass's Brains\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion and the Fox went hunting together.  The Lion, on the\r\nadvice of the Fox, sent a message to the Ass, proposing to make an\r\nalliance between their two families.  The Ass came to the place of\r\nmeeting, overjoyed at the prospect of a royal alliance.  But when\r\nhe came there the Lion simply pounced on the Ass, and said to the\r\nFox: \"Here is our dinner for to-day.  Watch you here while I go\r\nand have a nap.  Woe betide you if you touch my prey.\"  The Lion\r\nwent away and the Fox waited; but finding that his master did not\r\nreturn, ventured to take out the brains of the Ass and ate them\r\nup.  When the Lion came back he soon noticed the absence of the\r\nbrains, and asked the Fox in a terrible voice: \"What have you done\r\nwith the brains?\"\r\n\r\n\"Brains, your Majesty! it had none, or it would never have\r\nfallen into your trap.\"\r\n\r\nWit has always an answer ready.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Eagle and the Arrow\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Eagle was soaring through the air when suddenly it heard\r\nthe whizz of an Arrow, and felt itself wounded to death.  Slowly\r\nit fluttered down to the earth, with its life-blood pouring out of\r\nit.  Looking down upon the Arrow with which it had been pierced,\r\nit found that the shaft of the Arrow had been feathered with one\r\nof its own plumes.  \"Alas!\" it cried, as it died,\r\n\r\n\"We often give our enemies the means for our own destruction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Milkmaid and Her Pail\r\n\r\n\r\nPatty the Milkmaid was going to market carrying her milk in a\r\nPail on her head.  As she went along she began calculating what\r\nshe would do with the money she would get for the milk.  \"I'll buy\r\nsome fowls from Farmer Brown,\" said she, \"and they will lay eggs\r\neach morning, which I will sell to the parson's wife.  With the\r\nmoney that I get from the sale of these eggs I'll buy myself a new\r\ndimity frock and a chip hat; and when I go to market, won't all\r\nthe young men come up and speak to me!  Polly Shaw will be that\r\njealous; but I don't care.  I shall just look at her and toss my\r\nhead like this.  As she spoke she tossed her head back, the Pail\r\nfell off it, and all the milk was spilt.  So she had to go home\r\nand tell her mother what had occurred.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, my child,\" said the mother,\r\n\r\n\"Do not count your chickens before they are hatched.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Cat-Maiden\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gods were once disputing whether it was possible for a\r\nliving being to change its nature.  Jupiter said \"Yes,\" but Venus\r\nsaid \"No.\"  So, to try the question, Jupiter turned a Cat into a\r\nMaiden, and gave her to a young man for a wife.  The wedding was\r\nduly performed and the young couple sat down to the wedding-feast.\r\n\"See,\" said Jupiter, to Venus, \"how becomingly she behaves.  Who\r\ncould tell that yesterday she was but a Cat?  Surely her nature is\r\nchanged?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute,\" replied Venus, and let loose a mouse into the\r\nroom.  No sooner did the bride see this than she jumped up from\r\nher seat and tried to pounce upon the mouse.  \"Ah, you see,\" said\r\nVenus,\r\n\r\n\"Nature will out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Horse and the Ass\r\n\r\n\r\nA Horse and an Ass were travelling together, the Horse\r\nprancing along in its fine trappings, the Ass carrying with\r\ndifficulty the heavy weight in its panniers.  \"I wish I were you,\"\r\nsighed the Ass; \"nothing to do and well fed, and all that fine\r\nharness upon you.\"  Next day, however, there was a great battle,\r\nand the Horse was wounded to death in the final charge of the day.\r\nHis friend, the Ass, happened to pass by shortly afterwards and\r\nfound him on the point of death.  \"I was wrong,\" said the Ass:\r\n\r\n\"Better humble security than gilded danger.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Trumpeter Taken Prisoner\r\n\r\n\r\nA Trumpeter during a battle ventured too near the enemy and\r\nwas captured by them.  They were about to proceed to put him to\r\ndeath when he begged them to hear his plea for mercy.  \"I do not\r\nfight,\" said he, \"and indeed carry no weapon; I only blow this\r\ntrumpet, and surely that cannot harm you; then why should you kill\r\nme?\"\r\n\r\n\"You may not fight yourself,\" said the others, \"but you\r\nencourage and guide your men to the fight.\"\r\n\r\nWords may be deeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Buffoon and the Countryman\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a country fair there was a Buffoon who made all the people\r\nlaugh by imitating the cries of various animals.  He finished off\r\nby squeaking so like a pig that the spectators thought that he had\r\na porker concealed about him.  But a Countryman who stood by said:\r\n\"Call that a pig's squeak!  Nothing like it.  You give me till\r\ntomorrow and I will show you what it's like.\"  The audience\r\nlaughed, but next day, sure enough, the Countryman appeared on the\r\nstage, and putting his head down squealed so hideously that the\r\nspectators hissed and threw stones at him to make him stop.  \"You\r\nfools!\" he cried, \"see what you have been hissing,\" and held up a\r\nlittle pig whose ear he had been pinching to make him utter the\r\nsqueals.\r\n\r\nMen often applaud an imitation and hiss the real thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Old Woman and the Wine-Jar\r\n\r\n\r\nYou must know that sometimes old women like a glass of wine.\r\nOne of this sort once found a Wine-jar lying in the road, and\r\neagerly went up to it hoping to find it full.  But when she took\r\nit up she found that all the wine had been drunk out of it.  Still\r\nshe took a long sniff at the mouth of the Jar.  \"Ah,\" she cried,\r\n\r\n\"What memories cling 'round the instruments of our pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Fox and the Goat\r\n\r\n\r\nBy an unlucky chance a Fox fell into a deep well from which he\r\ncould not get out.  A Goat passed by shortly afterwards, and asked\r\nthe Fox what he was doing down there.  \"Oh, have you not heard?\"\r\nsaid the Fox; \"there is going to be a great drought, so I jumped\r\ndown here in order to be sure to have water by me.  Why don't you\r\ncome down too?\"  The Goat thought well of this advice, and jumped\r\ndown into the well.  But the Fox immediately jumped on her back,\r\nand by putting his foot on her long horns managed to jump up to\r\nthe edge of the well.  \"Good-bye, friend,\" said the Fox, \"remember\r\nnext time,\r\n\r\n\"Never trust the advice of a man in difficulties.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
