The Wild Land\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nOne January day, thirty years ago, the little town of Hanover,\r\nanchored on a windy Nebraska tableland, was trying not to be blown\r\naway. A mist of fine snowflakes was curling and eddying about the\r\ncluster of low drab buildings huddled on the gray prairie, under\r\na gray sky. The dwelling-houses were set about haphazard on the\r\ntough prairie sod; some of them looked as if they had been moved in\r\novernight, and others as if they were straying off by themselves,\r\nheaded straight for the open plain. None of them had any appearance\r\nof permanence, and the howling wind blew under them as well as over\r\nthem. The main street was a deeply rutted road, now frozen hard,\r\nwhich ran from the squat red railway station and the grain \"elevator\"\r\nat the north end of the town to the lumber yard and the horse pond\r\nat the south end. On either side of this road straggled two uneven\r\nrows of wooden buildings; the general merchandise stores, the two\r\nbanks, the drug store, the feed store, the saloon, the post-office.\r\nThe board sidewalks were gray with trampled snow, but at two o'clock\r\nin the afternoon the shopkeepers, having come back from dinner,\r\nwere keeping well behind their frosty windows. The children were\r\nall in school, and there was nobody abroad in the streets but a\r\nfew rough-looking countrymen in coarse overcoats, with their long\r\ncaps pulled down to their noses. Some of them had brought their\r\nwives to town, and now and then a red or a plaid shawl flashed out\r\nof one store into the shelter of another. At the hitch-bars along\r\nthe street a few heavy work-horses, harnessed to farm wagons,\r\nshivered under their blankets. About the station everything was\r\nquiet, for there would not be another train in until night.\r\n\r\nOn the sidewalk in front of one of the stores sat a little Swede\r\nboy, crying bitterly. He was about five years old. His black cloth\r\ncoat was much too big for him and made him look like a little old\r\nman. His shrunken brown flannel dress had been washed many times\r\nand left a long stretch of stocking between the hem of his skirt\r\nand the tops of his clumsy, copper-toed shoes. His cap was pulled\r\ndown over his ears; his nose and his chubby cheeks were chapped and\r\nred with cold. He cried quietly, and the few people who hurried\r\nby did not notice him. He was afraid to stop any one, afraid to\r\ngo into the store and ask for help, so he sat wringing his long\r\nsleeves and looking up a telegraph pole beside him, whimpering, \"My\r\nkitten, oh, my kitten! Her will fweeze!\" At the top of the pole\r\ncrouched a shivering gray kitten, mewing faintly and clinging\r\ndesperately to the wood with her claws. The boy had been left\r\nat the store while his sister went to the doctor's office, and in\r\nher absence a dog had chased his kitten up the pole. The little\r\ncreature had never been so high before, and she was too frightened\r\nto move. Her master was sunk in despair. He was a little country\r\nboy, and this village was to him a very strange and perplexing\r\nplace, where people wore fine clothes and had hard hearts. He\r\nalways felt shy and awkward here, and wanted to hide behind things\r\nfor fear some one might laugh at him. Just now, he was too unhappy\r\nto care who laughed. At last he seemed to see a ray of hope: his\r\nsister was coming, and he got up and ran toward her in his heavy\r\nshoes.\r\n\r\nHis sister was a tall, strong girl, and she walked rapidly and\r\nresolutely, as if she knew exactly where she was going and what she\r\nwas going to do next. She wore a man's long ulster (not as if it\r\nwere an affliction, but as if it were very comfortable and belonged\r\nto her; carried it like a young soldier), and a round plush cap,\r\ntied down with a thick veil. She had a serious, thoughtful face,\r\nand her clear, deep blue eyes were fixed intently on the distance,\r\nwithout seeming to see anything, as if she were in trouble. She\r\ndid not notice the little boy until he pulled her by the coat.\r\nThen she stopped short and stooped down to wipe his wet face.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Emil! I told you to stay in the store and not to come out.\r\nWhat is the matter with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"My kitten, sister, my kitten! A man put her out, and a dog chased\r\nher up there.\" His forefinger, projecting from the sleeve of his\r\ncoat, pointed up to the wretched little creature on the pole.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Emil! Didn't I tell you she'd get us into trouble of some\r\nkind, if you brought her? What made you tease me so? But there,\r\nI ought to have known better myself.\" She went to the foot of the\r\npole and held out her arms, crying, \"Kitty, kitty, kitty,\" but the\r\nkitten only mewed and faintly waved its tail. Alexandra turned\r\naway decidedly. \"No, she won't come down. Somebody will have to\r\ngo up after her. I saw the Linstrums' wagon in town. I'll go and\r\nsee if I can find Carl. Maybe he can do something. Only you must\r\nstop crying, or I won't go a step. Where's your comforter? Did\r\nyou leave it in the store? Never mind. Hold still, till I put\r\nthis on you.\"\r\n\r\nShe unwound the brown veil from her head and tied it about his\r\nthroat. A shabby little traveling man, who was just then coming out\r\nof the store on his way to the saloon, stopped and gazed stupidly\r\nat the shining mass of hair she bared when she took off her veil;\r\ntwo thick braids, pinned about her head in the German way, with a\r\nfringe of reddish-yellow curls blowing out from under her cap. He\r\ntook his cigar out of his mouth and held the wet end between the\r\nfingers of his woolen glove. \"My God, girl, what a head of hair!\"\r\nhe exclaimed, quite innocently and foolishly. She stabbed him with\r\na glance of Amazonian fierceness and drew in her lower lip--most\r\nunnecessary severity. It gave the little clothing drummer such a\r\nstart that he actually let his cigar fall to the sidewalk and went\r\noff weakly in the teeth of the wind to the saloon. His hand was\r\nstill unsteady when he took his glass from the bartender. His\r\nfeeble flirtatious instincts had been crushed before, but never\r\nso mercilessly. He felt cheap and ill-used, as if some one had\r\ntaken advantage of him. When a drummer had been knocking about in\r\nlittle drab towns and crawling across the wintry country in dirty\r\nsmoking-cars, was he to be blamed if, when he chanced upon a fine\r\nhuman creature, he suddenly wished himself more of a man?\r\n\r\nWhile the little drummer was drinking to recover his nerve, Alexandra\r\nhurried to the drug store as the most likely place to find Carl\r\nLinstrum. There he was, turning over a portfolio of chromo \"studies\"\r\nwhich the druggist sold to the Hanover women who did china-painting.\r\nAlexandra explained her predicament, and the boy followed her to\r\nthe corner, where Emil still sat by the pole.\r\n\r\n\"I'll have to go up after her, Alexandra. I think at the depot\r\nthey have some spikes I can strap on my feet. Wait a minute.\" Carl\r\nthrust his hands into his pockets, lowered his head, and darted up\r\nthe street against the north wind. He was a tall boy of fifteen,\r\nslight and narrow-chested. When he came back with the spikes,\r\nAlexandra asked him what he had done with his overcoat.\r\n\r\n\"I left it in the drug store. I couldn't climb in it, anyhow.\r\nCatch me if I fall, Emil,\" he called back as he began his ascent.\r\nAlexandra watched him anxiously; the cold was bitter enough on the\r\nground. The kitten would not budge an inch. Carl had to go to\r\nthe very top of the pole, and then had some difficulty in tearing\r\nher from her hold. When he reached the ground, he handed the cat\r\nto her tearful little master. \"Now go into the store with her,\r\nEmil, and get warm.\" He opened the door for the child. \"Wait a\r\nminute, Alexandra. Why can't I drive for you as far as our place?\r\nIt's getting colder every minute. Have you seen the doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He is coming over to-morrow. But he says father can't\r\nget better; can't get well.\" The girl's lip trembled. She looked\r\nfixedly up the bleak street as if she were gathering her strength\r\nto face something, as if she were trying with all her might to\r\ngrasp a situation which, no matter how painful, must be met and\r\ndealt with somehow. The wind flapped the skirts of her heavy coat\r\nabout her.\r\n\r\nCarl did not say anything, but she felt his sympathy. He, too, was\r\nlonely. He was a thin, frail boy, with brooding dark eyes, very\r\nquiet in all his movements. There was a delicate pallor in his thin\r\nface, and his mouth was too sensitive for a boy's. The lips had\r\nalready a little curl of bitterness and skepticism. The two friends\r\nstood for a few moments on the windy street corner, not speaking\r\na word, as two travelers, who have lost their way, sometimes stand\r\nand admit their perplexity in silence. When Carl turned away he\r\nsaid, \"I'll see to your team.\" Alexandra went into the store to\r\nhave her purchases packed in the egg-boxes, and to get warm before\r\nshe set out on her long cold drive.\r\n\r\nWhen she looked for Emil, she found him sitting on a step of the\r\nstaircase that led up to the clothing and carpet department. He\r\nwas playing with a little Bohemian girl, Marie Tovesky, who was\r\ntying her handkerchief over the kitten's head for a bonnet. Marie\r\nwas a stranger in the country, having come from Omaha with her mother\r\nto visit her uncle, Joe Tovesky. She was a dark child, with brown\r\ncurly hair, like a brunette doll's, a coaxing little red mouth, and\r\nround, yellow-brown eyes. Every one noticed her eyes; the brown\r\niris had golden glints that made them look like gold-stone, or, in\r\nsofter lights, like that Colorado mineral called tiger-eye.\r\n\r\nThe country children thereabouts wore their dresses to their\r\nshoe-tops, but this city child was dressed in what was then called\r\nthe \"Kate Greenaway\" manner, and her red cashmere frock, gathered\r\nfull from the yoke, came almost to the floor. This, with her\r\npoke bonnet, gave her the look of a quaint little woman. She had\r\na white fur tippet about her neck and made no fussy objections when\r\nEmil fingered it admiringly. Alexandra had not the heart to take\r\nhim away from so pretty a playfellow, and she let them tease the\r\nkitten together until Joe Tovesky came in noisily and picked up\r\nhis little niece, setting her on his shoulder for every one to see.\r\nHis children were all boys, and he adored this little creature.\r\nHis cronies formed a circle about him, admiring and teasing the\r\nlittle girl, who took their jokes with great good nature. They\r\nwere all delighted with her, for they seldom saw so pretty and\r\ncarefully nurtured a child. They told her that she must choose\r\none of them for a sweetheart, and each began pressing his suit and\r\noffering her bribes; candy, and little pigs, and spotted calves.\r\nShe looked archly into the big, brown, mustached faces, smelling\r\nof spirits and tobacco, then she ran her tiny forefinger delicately\r\nover Joe's bristly chin and said, \"Here is my sweetheart.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bohemians roared with laughter, and Marie's uncle hugged her\r\nuntil she cried, \"Please don't, Uncle Joe! You hurt me.\" Each\r\nof Joe's friends gave her a bag of candy, and she kissed them all\r\naround, though she did not like country candy very well. Perhaps\r\nthat was why she bethought herself of Emil. \"Let me down, Uncle\r\nJoe,\" she said, \"I want to give some of my candy to that nice little\r\nboy I found.\" She walked graciously over to Emil, followed by her\r\nlusty admirers, who formed a new circle and teased the little boy\r\nuntil he hid his face in his sister's skirts, and she had to scold\r\nhim for being such a baby.\r\n\r\nThe farm people were making preparations to start for home. The\r\nwomen were checking over their groceries and pinning their big red\r\nshawls about their heads. The men were buying tobacco and candy\r\nwith what money they had left, were showing each other new boots and\r\ngloves and blue flannel shirts. Three big Bohemians were drinking\r\nraw alcohol, tinctured with oil of cinnamon. This was said to\r\nfortify one effectually against the cold, and they smacked their\r\nlips after each pull at the flask. Their volubility drowned every\r\nother noise in the place, and the overheated store sounded of\r\ntheir spirited language as it reeked of pipe smoke, damp woolens,\r\nand kerosene.\r\n\r\nCarl came in, wearing his overcoat and carrying a wooden box with\r\na brass handle. \"Come,\" he said, \"I've fed and watered your team,\r\nand the wagon is ready.\" He carried Emil out and tucked him down\r\nin the straw in the wagonbox. The heat had made the little boy\r\nsleepy, but he still clung to his kitten.\r\n\r\n\"You were awful good to climb so high and get my kitten, Carl.\r\nWhen I get big I'll climb and get little boys' kittens for them,\"\r\nhe murmured drowsily. Before the horses were over the first hill,\r\nEmil and his cat were both fast asleep.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was only four o'clock, the winter day was fading. The\r\nroad led southwest, toward the streak of pale, watery light that\r\nglimmered in the leaden sky. The light fell upon the two sad young\r\nfaces that were turned mutely toward it: upon the eyes of the girl,\r\nwho seemed to be looking with such anguished perplexity into the\r\nfuture; upon the sombre eyes of the boy, who seemed already to be\r\nlooking into the past. The little town behind them had vanished as\r\nif it had never been, had fallen behind the swell of the prairie,\r\nand the stern frozen country received them into its bosom. The\r\nhomesteads were few and far apart; here and there a windmill gaunt\r\nagainst the sky, a sod house crouching in a hollow. But the great\r\nfact was the land itself, which seemed to overwhelm the little\r\nbeginnings of human society that struggled in its sombre wastes.\r\nIt was from facing this vast hardness that the boy's mouth had\r\nbecome so bitter; because he felt that men were too weak to make\r\nany mark here, that the land wanted to be let alone, to preserve\r\nits own fierce strength, its peculiar, savage kind of beauty, its\r\nuninterrupted mournfulness.\r\n\r\nThe wagon jolted along over the frozen road. The two friends had\r\nless to say to each other than usual, as if the cold had somehow\r\npenetrated to their hearts.\r\n\r\n\"Did Lou and Oscar go to the Blue to cut wood to-day?\" Carl asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I'm almost sorry I let them go, it's turned so cold. But\r\nmother frets if the wood gets low.\" She stopped and put her hand\r\nto her forehead, brushing back her hair. \"I don't know what is to\r\nbecome of us, Carl, if father has to die. I don't dare to think\r\nabout it. I wish we could all go with him and let the grass grow\r\nback over everything.\"\r\n\r\nCarl made no reply. Just ahead of them was the Norwegian graveyard,\r\nwhere the grass had, indeed, grown back over everything, shaggy and\r\nred, hiding even the wire fence. Carl realized that he was not a\r\nvery helpful companion, but there was nothing he could say.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" Alexandra went on, steadying her voice a little, \"the\r\nboys are strong and work hard, but we've always depended so on\r\nfather that I don't see how we can go ahead. I almost feel as if\r\nthere were nothing to go ahead for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does your father know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think he does. He lies and counts on his fingers all day.\r\nI think he is trying to count up what he is leaving for us. It's\r\na comfort to him that my chickens are laying right on through the\r\ncold weather and bringing in a little money. I wish we could keep\r\nhis mind off such things, but I don't have much time to be with\r\nhim now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if he'd like to have me bring my magic lantern over some\r\nevening?\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra turned her face toward him. \"Oh, Carl! Have you got\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. It's back there in the straw. Didn't you notice the box\r\nI was carrying? I tried it all morning in the drug-store cellar,\r\nand it worked ever so well, makes fine big pictures.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are they about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hunting pictures in Germany, and Robinson Crusoe and funny\r\npictures about cannibals. I'm going to paint some slides for it\r\non glass, out of the Hans Andersen book.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra seemed actually cheered. There is often a good deal of\r\nthe child left in people who have had to grow up too soon. \"Do\r\nbring it over, Carl. I can hardly wait to see it, and I'm sure it\r\nwill please father. Are the pictures colored? Then I know he'll\r\nlike them. He likes the calendars I get him in town. I wish I\r\ncould get more. You must leave me here, mustn't you? It's been\r\nnice to have company.\"\r\n\r\nCarl stopped the horses and looked dubiously up at the black sky.\r\n\"It's pretty dark. Of course the horses will take you home, but\r\nI think I'd better light your lantern, in case you should need it.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave her the reins and climbed back into the wagon-box, where\r\nhe crouched down and made a tent of his overcoat. After a dozen\r\ntrials he succeeded in lighting the lantern, which he placed in\r\nfront of Alexandra, half covering it with a blanket so that the\r\nlight would not shine in her eyes. \"Now, wait until I find my box.\r\nYes, here it is. Good-night, Alexandra. Try not to worry.\" Carl\r\nsprang to the ground and ran off across the fields toward the Linstrum\r\nhomestead. \"Hoo, hoo-o-o-o!\" he called back as he disappeared over\r\na ridge and dropped into a sand gully. The wind answered him like\r\nan echo, \"Hoo, hoo-o-o-o-o-o!\" Alexandra drove off alone. The\r\nrattle of her wagon was lost in the howling of the wind, but her\r\nlantern, held firmly between her feet, made a moving point of light\r\nalong the highway, going deeper and deeper into the dark country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nOn one of the ridges of that wintry waste stood the low log house\r\nin which John Bergson was dying. The Bergson homestead was easier\r\nto find than many another, because it overlooked Norway Creek, a\r\nshallow, muddy stream that sometimes flowed, and sometimes stood\r\nstill, at the bottom of a winding ravine with steep, shelving sides\r\novergrown with brush and cottonwoods and dwarf ash. This creek\r\ngave a sort of identity to the farms that bordered upon it. Of all\r\nthe bewildering things about a new country, the absence of human\r\nlandmarks is one of the most depressing and disheartening. The\r\nhouses on the Divide were small and were usually tucked away\r\nin low places; you did not see them until you came directly upon\r\nthem. Most of them were built of the sod itself, and were only\r\nthe unescapable ground in another form. The roads were but faint\r\ntracks in the grass, and the fields were scarcely noticeable. The\r\nrecord of the plow was insignificant, like the feeble scratches on\r\nstone left by prehistoric races, so indeterminate that they may,\r\nafter all, be only the markings of glaciers, and not a record of\r\nhuman strivings.\r\n\r\nIn eleven long years John Bergson had made but little impression\r\nupon the wild land he had come to tame. It was still a wild thing\r\nthat had its ugly moods; and no one knew when they were likely to\r\ncome, or why. Mischance hung over it. Its Genius was unfriendly\r\nto man. The sick man was feeling this as he lay looking out of\r\nthe window, after the doctor had left him, on the day following\r\nAlexandra's trip to town. There it lay outside his door, the same\r\nland, the same lead-colored miles. He knew every ridge and draw\r\nand gully between him and the horizon. To the south, his plowed\r\nfields; to the east, the sod stables, the cattle corral, the\r\npond,--and then the grass.\r\n\r\nBergson went over in his mind the things that had held him back.\r\nOne winter his cattle had perished in a blizzard. The next summer\r\none of his plow horses broke its leg in a prairiedog hole and had\r\nto be shot. Another summer he lost his hogs from cholera, and\r\na valuable stallion died from a rattlesnake bite. Time and again\r\nhis crops had failed. He had lost two children, boys, that came\r\nbetween Lou and Emil, and there had been the cost of sickness and\r\ndeath. Now, when he had at last struggled out of debt, he was\r\ngoing to die himself. He was only forty-six, and had, of course,\r\ncounted upon more time.\r\n\r\nBergson had spent his first five years on the Divide getting into\r\ndebt, and the last six getting out. He had paid off his mortgages\r\nand had ended pretty much where he began, with the land. He owned\r\nexactly six hundred and forty acres of what stretched outside his\r\ndoor; his own original homestead and timber claim, making three\r\nhundred and twenty acres, and the half-section adjoining, the\r\nhomestead of a younger brother who had given up the fight, gone\r\nback to Chicago to work in a fancy bakery and distinguish himself\r\nin a Swedish athletic club. So far John had not attempted to\r\ncultivate the second half-section, but used it for pasture land,\r\nand one of his sons rode herd there in open weather.\r\n\r\nJohn Bergson had the Old-World belief that land, in itself, is\r\ndesirable. But this land was an enigma. It was like a horse that\r\nno one knows how to break to harness, that runs wild and kicks\r\nthings to pieces. He had an idea that no one understood how to\r\nfarm it properly, and this he often discussed with Alexandra. Their\r\nneighbors, certainly, knew even less about farming than he did.\r\nMany of them had never worked on a farm until they took up their\r\nhomesteads. They had been HANDWERKERS at home; tailors, locksmiths,\r\njoiners, cigar-makers, etc. Bergson himself had worked in a\r\nshipyard.\r\n\r\nFor weeks, John Bergson had been thinking about these things. His\r\nbed stood in the sitting-room, next to the kitchen. Through the\r\nday, while the baking and washing and ironing were going on, the\r\nfather lay and looked up at the roof beams that he himself had\r\nhewn, or out at the cattle in the corral. He counted the cattle\r\nover and over. It diverted him to speculate as to how much weight\r\neach of the steers would probably put on by spring. He often called\r\nhis daughter in to talk to her about this. Before Alexandra was\r\ntwelve years old she had begun to be a help to him, and as she grew\r\nolder he had come to depend more and more upon her resourcefulness\r\nand good judgment. His boys were willing enough to work, but when\r\nhe talked with them they usually irritated him. It was Alexandra\r\nwho read the papers and followed the markets, and who learned by\r\nthe mistakes of their neighbors. It was Alexandra who could always\r\ntell about what it had cost to fatten each steer, and who could\r\nguess the weight of a hog before it went on the scales closer than\r\nJohn Bergson himself. Lou and Oscar were industrious, but he could\r\nnever teach them to use their heads about their work.\r\n\r\nAlexandra, her father often said to himself, was like her\r\ngrandfather; which was his way of saying that she was intelligent.\r\nJohn Bergson's father had been a shipbuilder, a man of considerable\r\nforce and of some fortune. Late in life he married a second time,\r\na Stockholm woman of questionable character, much younger than he,\r\nwho goaded him into every sort of extravagance. On the shipbuilder's\r\npart, this marriage was an infatuation, the despairing folly of\r\na powerful man who cannot bear to grow old. In a few years his\r\nunprincipled wife warped the probity of a lifetime. He speculated,\r\nlost his own fortune and funds entrusted to him by poor seafaring\r\nmen, and died disgraced, leaving his children nothing. But when all\r\nwas said, he had come up from the sea himself, had built up a proud\r\nlittle business with no capital but his own skill and foresight, and\r\nhad proved himself a man. In his daughter, John Bergson recognized\r\nthe strength of will, and the simple direct way of thinking things\r\nout, that had characterized his father in his better days. He\r\nwould much rather, of course, have seen this likeness in one of\r\nhis sons, but it was not a question of choice. As he lay there\r\nday after day he had to accept the situation as it was, and to be\r\nthankful that there was one among his children to whom he could\r\nentrust the future of his family and the possibilities of his\r\nhard-won land.\r\n\r\nThe winter twilight was fading. The sick man heard his wife strike\r\na match in the kitchen, and the light of a lamp glimmered through\r\nthe cracks of the door. It seemed like a light shining far away.\r\nHe turned painfully in his bed and looked at his white hands, with\r\nall the work gone out of them. He was ready to give up, he felt.\r\nHe did not know how it had come about, but he was quite willing to\r\ngo deep under his fields and rest, where the plow could not find\r\nhim. He was tired of making mistakes. He was content to leave the\r\ntangle to other hands; he thought of his Alexandra's strong ones.\r\n\r\n\"DOTTER,\" he called feebly, \"DOTTER!\" He heard her quick step and\r\nsaw her tall figure appear in the doorway, with the light of the\r\nlamp behind her. He felt her youth and strength, how easily she\r\nmoved and stooped and lifted. But he would not have had it again\r\nif he could, not he! He knew the end too well to wish to begin\r\nagain. He knew where it all went to, what it all became.\r\n\r\nHis daughter came and lifted him up on his pillows. She called\r\nhim by an old Swedish name that she used to call him when she was\r\nlittle and took his dinner to him in the shipyard.\r\n\r\n\"Tell the boys to come here, daughter. I want to speak to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are feeding the horses, father. They have just come back\r\nfrom the Blue. Shall I call them?\"\r\n\r\nHe sighed. \"No, no. Wait until they come in. Alexandra, you will\r\nhave to do the best you can for your brothers. Everything will\r\ncome on you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do all I can, father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't let them get discouraged and go off like Uncle Otto. I want\r\nthem to keep the land.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will, father. We will never lose the land.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a sound of heavy feet in the kitchen. Alexandra went\r\nto the door and beckoned to her brothers, two strapping boys of\r\nseventeen and nineteen. They came in and stood at the foot of the\r\nbed. Their father looked at them searchingly, though it was too\r\ndark to see their faces; they were just the same boys, he told\r\nhimself, he had not been mistaken in them. The square head and\r\nheavy shoulders belonged to Oscar, the elder. The younger boy was\r\nquicker, but vacillating.\r\n\r\n\"Boys,\" said the father wearily, \"I want you to keep the land\r\ntogether and to be guided by your sister. I have talked to her\r\nsince I have been sick, and she knows all my wishes. I want no\r\nquarrels among my children, and so long as there is one house there\r\nmust be one head. Alexandra is the oldest, and she knows my wishes.\r\nShe will do the best she can. If she makes mistakes, she will not\r\nmake so many as I have made. When you marry, and want a house of\r\nyour own, the land will be divided fairly, according to the courts.\r\nBut for the next few years you will have it hard, and you must all\r\nkeep together. Alexandra will manage the best she can.\"\r\n\r\nOscar, who was usually the last to speak, replied because he\r\nwas the older, \"Yes, father. It would be so anyway, without your\r\nspeaking. We will all work the place together.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you will be guided by your sister, boys, and be good brothers\r\nto her, and good sons to your mother? That is good. And Alexandra\r\nmust not work in the fields any more. There is no necessity now.\r\nHire a man when you need help. She can make much more with her\r\neggs and butter than the wages of a man. It was one of my mistakes\r\nthat I did not find that out sooner. Try to break a little more\r\nland every year; sod corn is good for fodder. Keep turning the\r\nland, and always put up more hay than you need. Don't grudge your\r\nmother a little time for plowing her garden and setting out fruit\r\ntrees, even if it comes in a busy season. She has been a good\r\nmother to you, and she has always missed the old country.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they went back to the kitchen the boys sat down silently at\r\nthe table. Throughout the meal they looked down at their plates\r\nand did not lift their red eyes. They did not eat much, although\r\nthey had been working in the cold all day, and there was a rabbit\r\nstewed in gravy for supper, and prune pies.\r\n\r\nJohn Bergson had married beneath him, but he had married a good\r\nhousewife. Mrs. Bergson was a fair-skinned, corpulent woman, heavy\r\nand placid like her son, Oscar, but there was something comfortable\r\nabout her; perhaps it was her own love of comfort. For eleven years\r\nshe had worthily striven to maintain some semblance of household\r\norder amid conditions that made order very difficult. Habit\r\nwas very strong with Mrs. Bergson, and her unremitting efforts to\r\nrepeat the routine of her old life among new surroundings had done\r\na great deal to keep the family from disintegrating morally and\r\ngetting careless in their ways. The Bergsons had a log house, for\r\ninstance, only because Mrs. Bergson would not live in a sod house.\r\nShe missed the fish diet of her own country, and twice every summer\r\nshe sent the boys to the river, twenty miles to the southward, to\r\nfish for channel cat. When the children were little she used to\r\nload them all into the wagon, the baby in its crib, and go fishing\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nAlexandra often said that if her mother were cast upon a desert\r\nisland, she would thank God for her deliverance, make a garden,\r\nand find something to preserve. Preserving was almost a mania with\r\nMrs. Bergson. Stout as she was, she roamed the scrubby banks of\r\nNorway Creek looking for fox grapes and goose plums, like a wild\r\ncreature in search of prey. She made a yellow jam of the insipid\r\nground-cherries that grew on the prairie, flavoring it with lemon\r\npeel; and she made a sticky dark conserve of garden tomatoes. She\r\nhad experimented even with the rank buffalo-pea, and she could\r\nnot see a fine bronze cluster of them without shaking her head and\r\nmurmuring, \"What a pity!\" When there was nothing more to preserve,\r\nshe began to pickle. The amount of sugar she used in these processes\r\nwas sometimes a serious drain upon the family resources. She was\r\na good mother, but she was glad when her children were old enough\r\nnot to be in her way in the kitchen. She had never quite forgiven\r\nJohn Bergson for bringing her to the end of the earth; but, now\r\nthat she was there, she wanted to be let alone to reconstruct her\r\nold life in so far as that was possible. She could still take some\r\ncomfort in the world if she had bacon in the cave, glass jars on\r\nthe shelves, and sheets in the press. She disapproved of all her\r\nneighbors because of their slovenly housekeeping, and the women\r\nthought her very proud. Once when Mrs. Bergson, on her way to\r\nNorway Creek, stopped to see old Mrs. Lee, the old woman hid in\r\nthe haymow \"for fear Mis' Bergson would catch her barefoot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nOne Sunday afternoon in July, six months after John Bergson's death,\r\nCarl was sitting in the doorway of the Linstrum kitchen, dreaming\r\nover an illustrated paper, when he heard the rattle of a wagon along\r\nthe hill road. Looking up he recognized the Bergsons' team, with\r\ntwo seats in the wagon, which meant they were off for a pleasure\r\nexcursion. Oscar and Lou, on the front seat, wore their cloth hats\r\nand coats, never worn except on Sundays, and Emil, on the second\r\nseat with Alexandra, sat proudly in his new trousers, made from a\r\npair of his father's, and a pink-striped shirt, with a wide ruffled\r\ncollar. Oscar stopped the horses and waved to Carl, who caught up\r\nhis hat and ran through the melon patch to join them.\r\n\r\n\"Want to go with us?\" Lou called. \"We're going to Crazy Ivar's to\r\nbuy a hammock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure.\" Carl ran up panting, and clambering over the wheel sat\r\ndown beside Emil. \"I've always wanted to see Ivar's pond. They\r\nsay it's the biggest in all the country. Aren't you afraid to go\r\nto Ivar's in that new shirt, Emil? He might want it and take it\r\nright off your back.\"\r\n\r\nEmil grinned. \"I'd be awful scared to go,\" he admitted, \"if you\r\nbig boys weren't along to take care of me. Did you ever hear him\r\nhowl, Carl? People say sometimes he runs about the country howling\r\nat night because he is afraid the Lord will destroy him. Mother\r\nthinks he must have done something awful wicked.\"\r\n\r\nLou looked back and winked at Carl. \"What would you do, Emil, if\r\nyou was out on the prairie by yourself and seen him coming?\"\r\n\r\nEmil stared. \"Maybe I could hide in a badger-hole,\" he suggested\r\ndoubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"But suppose there wasn't any badger-hole,\" Lou persisted. \"Would\r\nyou run?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'd be too scared to run,\" Emil admitted mournfully, twisting\r\nhis fingers. \"I guess I'd sit right down on the ground and say my\r\nprayers.\"\r\n\r\nThe big boys laughed, and Oscar brandished his whip over the broad\r\nbacks of the horses.\r\n\r\n\"He wouldn't hurt you, Emil,\" said Carl persuasively. \"He came\r\nto doctor our mare when she ate green corn and swelled up most as\r\nbig as the water-tank. He petted her just like you do your cats.\r\nI couldn't understand much he said, for he don't talk any English,\r\nbut he kept patting her and groaning as if he had the pain himself,\r\nand saying, 'There now, sister, that's easier, that's better!'\"\r\n\r\nLou and Oscar laughed, and Emil giggled delightedly and looked up\r\nat his sister.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think he knows anything at all about doctoring,\" said\r\nOscar scornfully. \"They say when horses have distemper he takes\r\nthe medicine himself, and then prays over the horses.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra spoke up. \"That's what the Crows said, but he cured\r\ntheir horses, all the same. Some days his mind is cloudy, like.\r\nBut if you can get him on a clear day, you can learn a great deal\r\nfrom him. He understands animals. Didn't I see him take the horn\r\noff the Berquist's cow when she had torn it loose and went crazy?\r\nShe was tearing all over the place, knocking herself against things.\r\nAnd at last she ran out on the roof of the old dugout and her legs\r\nwent through and there she stuck, bellowing. Ivar came running\r\nwith his white bag, and the moment he got to her she was quiet and\r\nlet him saw her horn off and daub the place with tar.\"\r\n\r\nEmil had been watching his sister, his face reflecting the sufferings\r\nof the cow. \"And then didn't it hurt her any more?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nAlexandra patted him. \"No, not any more. And in two days they\r\ncould use her milk again.\"\r\n\r\nThe road to Ivar's homestead was a very poor one. He had settled\r\nin the rough country across the county line, where no one lived but\r\nsome Russians,--half a dozen families who dwelt together in one long\r\nhouse, divided off like barracks. Ivar had explained his choice\r\nby saying that the fewer neighbors he had, the fewer temptations.\r\nNevertheless, when one considered that his chief business was\r\nhorse-doctoring, it seemed rather short-sighted of him to live in the\r\nmost inaccessible place he could find. The Bergson wagon lurched\r\nalong over the rough hummocks and grass banks, followed the bottom\r\nof winding draws, or skirted the margin of wide lagoons, where the\r\ngolden coreopsis grew up out of the clear water and the wild ducks\r\nrose with a whirr of wings.\r\n\r\nLou looked after them helplessly. \"I wish I'd brought my gun,\r\nanyway, Alexandra,\" he said fretfully. \"I could have hidden it\r\nunder the straw in the bottom of the wagon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we'd have had to lie to Ivar. Besides, they say he can smell\r\ndead birds. And if he knew, we wouldn't get anything out of him,\r\nnot even a hammock. I want to talk to him, and he won't talk sense\r\nif he's angry. It makes him foolish.\"\r\n\r\nLou sniffed. \"Whoever heard of him talking sense, anyhow! I'd\r\nrather have ducks for supper than Crazy Ivar's tongue.\"\r\n\r\nEmil was alarmed. \"Oh, but, Lou, you don't want to make him mad!\r\nHe might howl!\"\r\n\r\nThey all laughed again, and Oscar urged the horses up the crumbling\r\nside of a clay bank. They had left the lagoons and the red grass\r\nbehind them. In Crazy Ivar's country the grass was short and gray,\r\nthe draws deeper than they were in the Bergsons' neighborhood,\r\nand the land was all broken up into hillocks and clay ridges. The\r\nwild flowers disappeared, and only in the bottom of the draws and\r\ngullies grew a few of the very toughest and hardiest: shoestring,\r\nand ironweed, and snow-on-the-mountain.\r\n\r\n\"Look, look, Emil, there's Ivar's big pond!\" Alexandra pointed to\r\na shining sheet of water that lay at the bottom of a shallow draw.\r\nAt one end of the pond was an earthen dam, planted with green willow\r\nbushes, and above it a door and a single window were set into the\r\nhillside. You would not have seen them at all but for the reflection\r\nof the sunlight upon the four panes of window-glass. And that was\r\nall you saw. Not a shed, not a corral, not a well, not even a path\r\nbroken in the curly grass. But for the piece of rusty stovepipe\r\nsticking up through the sod, you could have walked over the roof\r\nof Ivar's dwelling without dreaming that you were near a human\r\nhabitation. Ivar had lived for three years in the clay bank,\r\nwithout defiling the face of nature any more than the coyote that\r\nhad lived there before him had done.\r\n\r\nWhen the Bergsons drove over the hill, Ivar was sitting in the\r\ndoorway of his house, reading the Norwegian Bible. He was a queerly\r\nshaped old man, with a thick, powerful body set on short bow-legs.\r\nHis shaggy white hair, falling in a thick mane about his ruddy\r\ncheeks, made him look older than he was. He was barefoot, but\r\nhe wore a clean shirt of unbleached cotton, open at the neck. He\r\nalways put on a clean shirt when Sunday morning came round, though\r\nhe never went to church. He had a peculiar religion of his own\r\nand could not get on with any of the denominations. Often he did\r\nnot see anybody from one week's end to another. He kept a calendar,\r\nand every morning he checked off a day, so that he was never in\r\nany doubt as to which day of the week it was. Ivar hired himself\r\nout in threshing and corn-husking time, and he doctored sick animals\r\nwhen he was sent for. When he was at home, he made hammocks out\r\nof twine and committed chapters of the Bible to memory.\r\n\r\nIvar found contentment in the solitude he had sought out for himself.\r\nHe disliked the litter of human dwellings: the broken food, the\r\nbits of broken china, the old wash-boilers and tea-kettles thrown\r\ninto the sunflower patch. He preferred the cleanness and tidiness of\r\nthe wild sod. He always said that the badgers had cleaner houses\r\nthan people, and that when he took a housekeeper her name would\r\nbe Mrs. Badger. He best expressed his preference for his wild\r\nhomestead by saying that his Bible seemed truer to him there. If\r\none stood in the doorway of his cave, and looked off at the rough\r\nland, the smiling sky, the curly grass white in the hot sunlight;\r\nif one listened to the rapturous song of the lark, the drumming of\r\nthe quail, the burr of the locust against that vast silence, one\r\nunderstood what Ivar meant.\r\n\r\nOn this Sunday afternoon his face shone with happiness. He closed\r\nthe book on his knee, keeping the place with his horny finger, and\r\nrepeated softly:--\r\n\r\n  He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills;\r\n\r\n  They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild asses quench\r\n  their thirst.\r\n\r\n  The trees of the Lord are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon which\r\n  he hath planted;\r\n\r\n  Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees\r\n  are her house.\r\n\r\n  The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for\r\n  the conies.\r\n\r\nBefore he opened his Bible again, Ivar heard the Bergsons' wagon\r\napproaching, and he sprang up and ran toward it.\r\n\r\n\"No guns, no guns!\" he shouted, waving his arms distractedly.\r\n\r\n\"No, Ivar, no guns,\" Alexandra called reassuringly.\r\n\r\nHe dropped his arms and went up to the wagon, smiling amiably and\r\nlooking at them out of his pale blue eyes.\r\n\r\n\"We want to buy a hammock, if you have one,\" Alexandra explained,\r\n\"and my little brother, here, wants to see your big pond, where so\r\nmany birds come.\"\r\n\r\nIvar smiled foolishly, and began rubbing the horses' noses and\r\nfeeling about their mouths behind the bits. \"Not many birds just\r\nnow. A few ducks this morning; and some snipe come to drink. But\r\nthere was a crane last week. She spent one night and came back the\r\nnext evening. I don't know why. It is not her season, of course.\r\nMany of them go over in the fall. Then the pond is full of strange\r\nvoices every night.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra translated for Carl, who looked thoughtful. \"Ask him,\r\nAlexandra, if it is true that a sea gull came here once. I have\r\nheard so.\"\r\n\r\nShe had some difficulty in making the old man understand.\r\n\r\nHe looked puzzled at first, then smote his hands together as he\r\nremembered. \"Oh, yes, yes! A big white bird with long wings and\r\npink feet. My! what a voice she had! She came in the afternoon\r\nand kept flying about the pond and screaming until dark. She was\r\nin trouble of some sort, but I could not understand her. She was\r\ngoing over to the other ocean, maybe, and did not know how far it\r\nwas. She was afraid of never getting there. She was more mournful\r\nthan our birds here; she cried in the night. She saw the light\r\nfrom my window and darted up to it. Maybe she thought my house\r\nwas a boat, she was such a wild thing. Next morning, when the sun\r\nrose, I went out to take her food, but she flew up into the sky\r\nand went on her way.\" Ivar ran his fingers through his thick hair.\r\n\"I have many strange birds stop with me here. They come from very\r\nfar away and are great company. I hope you boys never shoot wild\r\nbirds?\"\r\n\r\nLou and Oscar grinned, and Ivar shook his bushy head. \"Yes, I know\r\nboys are thoughtless. But these wild things are God's birds. He\r\nwatches over them and counts them, as we do our cattle; Christ says\r\nso in the New Testament.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Ivar,\" Lou asked, \"may we water our horses at your pond and\r\ngive them some feed? It's a bad road to your place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, it is.\" The old man scrambled about and began to loose\r\nthe tugs. \"A bad road, eh, girls? And the bay with a colt at\r\nhome!\"\r\n\r\nOscar brushed the old man aside. \"We'll take care of the horses,\r\nIvar. You'll be finding some disease on them. Alexandra wants to\r\nsee your hammocks.\"\r\n\r\nIvar led Alexandra and Emil to his little cave house. He had but\r\none room, neatly plastered and whitewashed, and there was a wooden\r\nfloor. There was a kitchen stove, a table covered with oilcloth,\r\ntwo chairs, a clock, a calendar, a few books on the window-shelf;\r\nnothing more. But the place was as clean as a cupboard.\r\n\r\n\"But where do you sleep, Ivar?\" Emil asked, looking about.\r\n\r\nIvar unslung a hammock from a hook on the wall; in it was rolled\r\na buffalo robe. \"There, my son. A hammock is a good bed, and in\r\nwinter I wrap up in this skin. Where I go to work, the beds are\r\nnot half so easy as this.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time Emil had lost all his timidity. He thought a cave a\r\nvery superior kind of house. There was something pleasantly unusual\r\nabout it and about Ivar. \"Do the birds know you will be kind to\r\nthem, Ivar? Is that why so many come?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nIvar sat down on the floor and tucked his feet under him. \"See,\r\nlittle brother, they have come from a long way, and they are very\r\ntired. From up there where they are flying, our country looks dark\r\nand flat. They must have water to drink and to bathe in before\r\nthey can go on with their journey. They look this way and that,\r\nand far below them they see something shining, like a piece of glass\r\nset in the dark earth. That is my pond. They come to it and are\r\nnot disturbed. Maybe I sprinkle a little corn. They tell the other\r\nbirds, and next year more come this way. They have their roads up\r\nthere, as we have down here.\"\r\n\r\nEmil rubbed his knees thoughtfully. \"And is that true, Ivar, about\r\nthe head ducks falling back when they are tired, and the hind ones\r\ntaking their place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. The point of the wedge gets the worst of it; they cut the\r\nwind. They can only stand it there a little while--half an hour,\r\nmaybe. Then they fall back and the wedge splits a little, while\r\nthe rear ones come up the middle to the front. Then it closes up\r\nand they fly on, with a new edge. They are always changing like\r\nthat, up in the air. Never any confusion; just like soldiers who\r\nhave been drilled.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra had selected her hammock by the time the boys came up\r\nfrom the pond. They would not come in, but sat in the shade of\r\nthe bank outside while Alexandra and Ivar talked about the birds\r\nand about his housekeeping, and why he never ate meat, fresh or\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\nAlexandra was sitting on one of the wooden chairs, her arms resting\r\non the table. Ivar was sitting on the floor at her feet. \"Ivar,\"\r\nshe said suddenly, beginning to trace the pattern on the oilcloth\r\nwith her forefinger, \"I came to-day more because I wanted to talk\r\nto you than because I wanted to buy a hammock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" The old man scraped his bare feet on the plank floor.\r\n\r\n\"We have a big bunch of hogs, Ivar. I wouldn't sell in the spring,\r\nwhen everybody advised me to, and now so many people are losing\r\ntheir hogs that I am frightened. What can be done?\"\r\n\r\nIvar's little eyes began to shine. They lost their vagueness.\r\n\r\n\"You feed them swill and such stuff? Of course! And sour milk?\r\nOh, yes! And keep them in a stinking pen? I tell you, sister,\r\nthe hogs of this country are put upon! They become unclean, like\r\nthe hogs in the Bible. If you kept your chickens like that, what\r\nwould happen? You have a little sorghum patch, maybe? Put a fence\r\naround it, and turn the hogs in. Build a shed to give them shade,\r\na thatch on poles. Let the boys haul water to them in barrels,\r\nclean water, and plenty. Get them off the old stinking ground, and\r\ndo not let them go back there until winter. Give them only grain\r\nand clean feed, such as you would give horses or cattle. Hogs do\r\nnot like to be filthy.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys outside the door had been listening. Lou nudged his\r\nbrother. \"Come, the horses are done eating. Let's hitch up and\r\nget out of here. He'll fill her full of notions. She'll be for\r\nhaving the pigs sleep with us, next.\"\r\n\r\nOscar grunted and got up. Carl, who could not understand what Ivar\r\nsaid, saw that the two boys were displeased. They did not mind\r\nhard work, but they hated experiments and could never see the use\r\nof taking pains. Even Lou, who was more elastic than his older\r\nbrother, disliked to do anything different from their neighbors.\r\nHe felt that it made them conspicuous and gave people a chance to\r\ntalk about them.\r\n\r\nOnce they were on the homeward road, the boys forgot their ill-humor\r\nand joked about Ivar and his birds. Alexandra did not propose any\r\nreforms in the care of the pigs, and they hoped she had forgotten\r\nIvar's talk. They agreed that he was crazier than ever, and would\r\nnever be able to prove up on his land because he worked it so little.\r\nAlexandra privately resolved that she would have a talk with Ivar\r\nabout this and stir him up. The boys persuaded Carl to stay for\r\nsupper and go swimming in the pasture pond after dark.\r\n\r\nThat evening, after she had washed the supper dishes, Alexandra\r\nsat down on the kitchen doorstep, while her mother was mixing the\r\nbread. It was a still, deep-breathing summer night, full of the\r\nsmell of the hay fields. Sounds of laughter and splashing came\r\nup from the pasture, and when the moon rose rapidly above the bare\r\nrim of the prairie, the pond glittered like polished metal, and\r\nshe could see the flash of white bodies as the boys ran about the\r\nedge, or jumped into the water. Alexandra watched the shimmering\r\npool dreamily, but eventually her eyes went back to the sorghum\r\npatch south of the barn, where she was planning to make her new\r\npig corral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nFor the first three years after John Bergson's death, the affairs\r\nof his family prospered. Then came the hard times that brought\r\nevery one on the Divide to the brink of despair; three years of\r\ndrouth and failure, the last struggle of a wild soil against the\r\nencroaching plowshare. The first of these fruitless summers the\r\nBergson boys bore courageously. The failure of the corn crop made\r\nlabor cheap. Lou and Oscar hired two men and put in bigger crops\r\nthan ever before. They lost everything they spent. The whole\r\ncountry was discouraged. Farmers who were already in debt had to\r\ngive up their land. A few foreclosures demoralized the county.\r\nThe settlers sat about on the wooden sidewalks in the little town\r\nand told each other that the country was never meant for men to live\r\nin; the thing to do was to get back to Iowa, to Illinois, to any\r\nplace that had been proved habitable. The Bergson boys, certainly,\r\nwould have been happier with their uncle Otto, in the bakery shop\r\nin Chicago. Like most of their neighbors, they were meant to follow\r\nin paths already marked out for them, not to break trails in a new\r\ncountry. A steady job, a few holidays, nothing to think about, and\r\nthey would have been very happy. It was no fault of theirs that\r\nthey had been dragged into the wilderness when they were little\r\nboys. A pioneer should have imagination, should be able to enjoy\r\nthe idea of things more than the things themselves.\r\n\r\nThe second of these barren summers was passing. One September\r\nafternoon Alexandra had gone over to the garden across the draw to\r\ndig sweet potatoes--they had been thriving upon the weather that\r\nwas fatal to everything else. But when Carl Linstrum came up the\r\ngarden rows to find her, she was not working. She was standing\r\nlost in thought, leaning upon her pitchfork, her sunbonnet lying\r\nbeside her on the ground. The dry garden patch smelled of drying\r\nvines and was strewn with yellow seed-cucumbers and pumpkins and\r\ncitrons. At one end, next the rhubarb, grew feathery asparagus,\r\nwith red berries. Down the middle of the garden was a row of\r\ngooseberry and currant bushes. A few tough zenias and marigolds\r\nand a row of scarlet sage bore witness to the buckets of water\r\nthat Mrs. Bergson had carried there after sundown, against the\r\nprohibition of her sons. Carl came quietly and slowly up the garden\r\npath, looking intently at Alexandra. She did not hear him. She was\r\nstanding perfectly still, with that serious ease so characteristic\r\nof her. Her thick, reddish braids, twisted about her head, fairly\r\nburned in the sunlight. The air was cool enough to make the warm\r\nsun pleasant on one's back and shoulders, and so clear that the\r\neye could follow a hawk up and up, into the blazing blue depths of\r\nthe sky. Even Carl, never a very cheerful boy, and considerably\r\ndarkened by these last two bitter years, loved the country on days\r\nlike this, felt something strong and young and wild come out of\r\nit, that laughed at care.\r\n\r\n\"Alexandra,\" he said as he approached her, \"I want to talk to you.\r\nLet's sit down by the gooseberry bushes.\" He picked up her sack\r\nof potatoes and they crossed the garden. \"Boys gone to town?\" he\r\nasked as he sank down on the warm, sun-baked earth. \"Well, we have\r\nmade up our minds at last, Alexandra. We are really going away.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him as if she were a little frightened. \"Really,\r\nCarl? Is it settled?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, father has heard from St. Louis, and they will give him back\r\nhis old job in the cigar factory. He must be there by the first\r\nof November. They are taking on new men then. We will sell the\r\nplace for whatever we can get, and auction the stock. We haven't\r\nenough to ship. I am going to learn engraving with a German engraver\r\nthere, and then try to get work in Chicago.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra's hands dropped in her lap. Her eyes became dreamy and\r\nfilled with tears.\r\n\r\nCarl's sensitive lower lip trembled. He scratched in the soft earth\r\nbeside him with a stick. \"That's all I hate about it, Alexandra,\"\r\nhe said slowly. \"You've stood by us through so much and helped\r\nfather out so many times, and now it seems as if we were running\r\noff and leaving you to face the worst of it. But it isn't as if\r\nwe could really ever be of any help to you. We are only one more\r\ndrag, one more thing you look out for and feel responsible for.\r\nFather was never meant for a farmer, you know that. And I hate\r\nit. We'd only get in deeper and deeper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, Carl, I know. You are wasting your life here. You are\r\nable to do much better things. You are nearly nineteen now, and\r\nI wouldn't have you stay. I've always hoped you would get away.\r\nBut I can't help feeling scared when I think how I will miss\r\nyou--more than you will ever know.\" She brushed the tears from her\r\ncheeks, not trying to hide them.\r\n\r\n\"But, Alexandra,\" he said sadly and wistfully, \"I've never been\r\nany real help to you, beyond sometimes trying to keep the boys in\r\na good humor.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra smiled and shook her head. \"Oh, it's not that. Nothing\r\nlike that. It's by understanding me, and the boys, and mother,\r\nthat you've helped me. I expect that is the only way one person\r\never really can help another. I think you are about the only one\r\nthat ever helped me. Somehow it will take more courage to bear\r\nyour going than everything that has happened before.\"\r\n\r\nCarl looked at the ground. \"You see, we've all depended so on you,\"\r\nhe said, \"even father. He makes me laugh. When anything comes up\r\nhe always says, 'I wonder what the Bergsons are going to do about\r\nthat? I guess I'll go and ask her.' I'll never forget that time,\r\nwhen we first came here, and our horse had the colic, and I ran\r\nover to your place--your father was away, and you came home with me\r\nand showed father how to let the wind out of the horse. You were\r\nonly a little girl then, but you knew ever so much more about farm\r\nwork than poor father. You remember how homesick I used to get,\r\nand what long talks we used to have coming from school? We've\r\nsomeway always felt alike about things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's it; we've liked the same things and we've liked them\r\ntogether, without anybody else knowing. And we've had good times,\r\nhunting for Christmas trees and going for ducks and making our plum\r\nwine together every year. We've never either of us had any other\r\nclose friend. And now--\" Alexandra wiped her eyes with the corner\r\nof her apron, \"and now I must remember that you are going where\r\nyou will have many friends, and will find the work you were meant\r\nto do. But you'll write to me, Carl? That will mean a great deal\r\nto me here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll write as long as I live,\" cried the boy impetuously. \"And\r\nI'll be working for you as much as for myself, Alexandra. I want\r\nto do something you'll like and be proud of. I'm a fool here, but\r\nI know I can do something!\" He sat up and frowned at the red grass.\r\n\r\nAlexandra sighed. \"How discouraged the boys will be when they\r\nhear. They always come home from town discouraged, anyway. So\r\nmany people are trying to leave the country, and they talk to our\r\nboys and make them low-spirited. I'm afraid they are beginning to\r\nfeel hard toward me because I won't listen to any talk about going.\r\nSometimes I feel like I'm getting tired of standing up for this\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't tell the boys yet, if you'd rather not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'll tell them myself, to-night, when they come home. They'll\r\nbe talking wild, anyway, and no good comes of keeping bad news.\r\nIt's all harder on them than it is on me. Lou wants to get married,\r\npoor boy, and he can't until times are better. See, there goes the\r\nsun, Carl. I must be getting back. Mother will want her potatoes.\r\nIt's chilly already, the moment the light goes.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra rose and looked about. A golden afterglow throbbed in\r\nthe west, but the country already looked empty and mournful. A dark\r\nmoving mass came over the western hill, the Lee boy was bringing in\r\nthe herd from the other half-section. Emil ran from the windmill\r\nto open the corral gate. From the log house, on the little rise\r\nacross the draw, the smoke was curling. The cattle lowed and\r\nbellowed. In the sky the pale half-moon was slowly silvering.\r\nAlexandra and Carl walked together down the potato rows. \"I have\r\nto keep telling myself what is going to happen,\" she said softly.\r\n\"Since you have been here, ten years now, I have never really been\r\nlonely. But I can remember what it was like before. Now I shall\r\nhave nobody but Emil. But he is my boy, and he is tender-hearted.\"\r\n\r\nThat night, when the boys were called to supper, they sat down\r\nmoodily. They had worn their coats to town, but they ate in their\r\nstriped shirts and suspenders. They were grown men now, and, as\r\nAlexandra said, for the last few years they had been growing more\r\nand more like themselves. Lou was still the slighter of the two,\r\nthe quicker and more intelligent, but apt to go off at half-cock.\r\nHe had a lively blue eye, a thin, fair skin (always burned red to\r\nthe neckband of his shirt in summer), stiff, yellow hair that would\r\nnot lie down on his head, and a bristly little yellow mustache,\r\nof which he was very proud. Oscar could not grow a mustache; his\r\npale face was as bare as an egg, and his white eyebrows gave it an\r\nempty look. He was a man of powerful body and unusual endurance;\r\nthe sort of man you could attach to a corn-sheller as you would\r\nan engine. He would turn it all day, without hurrying, without\r\nslowing down. But he was as indolent of mind as he was unsparing\r\nof his body. His love of routine amounted to a vice. He worked\r\nlike an insect, always doing the same thing over in the same way,\r\nregardless of whether it was best or no. He felt that there was\r\na sovereign virtue in mere bodily toil, and he rather liked to\r\ndo things in the hardest way. If a field had once been in corn,\r\nhe couldn't bear to put it into wheat. He liked to begin his\r\ncorn-planting at the same time every year, whether the season were\r\nbackward or forward. He seemed to feel that by his own irreproachable\r\nregularity he would clear himself of blame and reprove the weather.\r\nWhen the wheat crop failed, he threshed the straw at a dead loss\r\nto demonstrate how little grain there was, and thus prove his case\r\nagainst Providence.\r\n\r\nLou, on the other hand, was fussy and flighty; always planned to\r\nget through two days' work in one, and often got only the least\r\nimportant things done. He liked to keep the place up, but he never\r\ngot round to doing odd jobs until he had to neglect more pressing\r\nwork to attend to them. In the middle of the wheat harvest, when\r\nthe grain was over-ripe and every hand was needed, he would stop\r\nto mend fences or to patch the harness; then dash down to the\r\nfield and overwork and be laid up in bed for a week. The two boys\r\nbalanced each other, and they pulled well together. They had been\r\ngood friends since they were children. One seldom went anywhere,\r\neven to town, without the other.\r\n\r\nTo-night, after they sat down to supper, Oscar kept looking at Lou\r\nas if he expected him to say something, and Lou blinked his eyes\r\nand frowned at his plate. It was Alexandra herself who at last\r\nopened the discussion.\r\n\r\n\"The Linstrums,\" she said calmly, as she put another plate of hot\r\nbiscuit on the table, \"are going back to St. Louis. The old man\r\nis going to work in the cigar factory again.\"\r\n\r\nAt this Lou plunged in. \"You see, Alexandra, everybody who can\r\ncrawl out is going away. There's no use of us trying to stick it\r\nout, just to be stubborn. There's something in knowing when to\r\nquit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you want to go, Lou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Any place where things will grow,\" said Oscar grimly.\r\n\r\nLou reached for a potato. \"Chris Arnson has traded his half-section\r\nfor a place down on the river.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who did he trade with?\"\r\n\r\n\"Charley Fuller, in town.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fuller the real estate man? You see, Lou, that Fuller has a head\r\non him. He's buying and trading for every bit of land he can get\r\nup here. It'll make him a rich man, some day.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's rich now, that's why he can take a chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why can't we? We'll live longer than he will. Some day the land\r\nitself will be worth more than all we can ever raise on it.\"\r\n\r\nLou laughed. \"It could be worth that, and still not be worth\r\nmuch. Why, Alexandra, you don't know what you're talking about.\r\nOur place wouldn't bring now what it would six years ago. The\r\nfellows that settled up here just made a mistake. Now they're\r\nbeginning to see this high land wasn't never meant to grow nothing\r\non, and everybody who ain't fixed to graze cattle is trying to\r\ncrawl out. It's too high to farm up here. All the Americans are\r\nskinning out. That man Percy Adams, north of town, told me that\r\nhe was going to let Fuller take his land and stuff for four hundred\r\ndollars and a ticket to Chicago.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's Fuller again!\" Alexandra exclaimed. \"I wish that man\r\nwould take me for a partner. He's feathering his nest! If only\r\npoor people could learn a little from rich people! But all these\r\nfellows who are running off are bad farmers, like poor Mr. Linstrum.\r\nThey couldn't get ahead even in good years, and they all got into\r\ndebt while father was getting out. I think we ought to hold on as\r\nlong as we can on father's account. He was so set on keeping this\r\nland. He must have seen harder times than this, here. How was it\r\nin the early days, mother?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Bergson was weeping quietly. These family discussions always\r\ndepressed her, and made her remember all that she had been torn\r\naway from. \"I don't see why the boys are always taking on about\r\ngoing away,\" she said, wiping her eyes. \"I don't want to move\r\nagain; out to some raw place, maybe, where we'd be worse off than\r\nwe are here, and all to do over again. I won't move! If the rest\r\nof you go, I will ask some of the neighbors to take me in, and stay\r\nand be buried by father. I'm not going to leave him by himself\r\non the prairie, for cattle to run over.\" She began to cry more\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\nThe boys looked angry. Alexandra put a soothing hand on her mother's\r\nshoulder. \"There's no question of that, mother. You don't have\r\nto go if you don't want to. A third of the place belongs to you\r\nby American law, and we can't sell without your consent. We only\r\nwant you to advise us. How did it use to be when you and father\r\nfirst came? Was it really as bad as this, or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, worse! Much worse,\" moaned Mrs. Bergson. \"Drouth, chince-bugs,\r\nhail, everything! My garden all cut to pieces like sauerkraut. No\r\ngrapes on the creek, no nothing. The people all lived just like\r\ncoyotes.\"\r\n\r\nOscar got up and tramped out of the kitchen. Lou followed him.\r\nThey felt that Alexandra had taken an unfair advantage in turning\r\ntheir mother loose on them. The next morning they were silent and\r\nreserved. They did not offer to take the women to church, but went\r\ndown to the barn immediately after breakfast and stayed there all\r\nday. When Carl Linstrum came over in the afternoon, Alexandra\r\nwinked to him and pointed toward the barn. He understood her and\r\nwent down to play cards with the boys. They believed that a very\r\nwicked thing to do on Sunday, and it relieved their feelings.\r\n\r\nAlexandra stayed in the house. On Sunday afternoon Mrs. Bergson\r\nalways took a nap, and Alexandra read. During the week she read\r\nonly the newspaper, but on Sunday, and in the long evenings of\r\nwinter, she read a good deal; read a few things over a great many\r\ntimes. She knew long portions of the \"Frithjof Saga\" by heart,\r\nand, like most Swedes who read at all, she was fond of Longfellow's\r\nverse,--the ballads and the \"Golden Legend\" and \"The Spanish Student.\"\r\nTo-day she sat in the wooden rocking-chair with the Swedish Bible\r\nopen on her knees, but she was not reading. She was looking\r\nthoughtfully away at the point where the upland road disappeared\r\nover the rim of the prairie. Her body was in an attitude of perfect\r\nrepose, such as it was apt to take when she was thinking earnestly.\r\nHer mind was slow, truthful, steadfast. She had not the least\r\nspark of cleverness.\r\n\r\nAll afternoon the sitting-room was full of quiet and sunlight.\r\nEmil was making rabbit traps in the kitchen shed. The hens were\r\nclucking and scratching brown holes in the flower beds, and the\r\nwind was teasing the prince's feather by the door.\r\n\r\nThat evening Carl came in with the boys to supper.\r\n\r\n\"Emil,\" said Alexandra, when they were all seated at the table,\r\n\"how would you like to go traveling? Because I am going to take\r\na trip, and you can go with me if you want to.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys looked up in amazement; they were always afraid of\r\nAlexandra's schemes. Carl was interested.\r\n\r\n\"I've been thinking, boys,\" she went on, \"that maybe I am too set\r\nagainst making a change. I'm going to take Brigham and the buckboard\r\nto-morrow and drive down to the river country and spend a few days\r\nlooking over what they've got down there. If I find anything good,\r\nyou boys can go down and make a trade.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody down there will trade for anything up here,\" said Oscar\r\ngloomily.\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I want to find out. Maybe they are just as\r\ndiscontented down there as we are up here. Things away from home\r\noften look better than they are. You know what your Hans Andersen\r\nbook says, Carl, about the Swedes liking to buy Danish bread and\r\nthe Danes liking to buy Swedish bread, because people always think\r\nthe bread of another country is better than their own. Anyway,\r\nI've heard so much about the river farms, I won't be satisfied till\r\nI've seen for myself.\"\r\n\r\nLou fidgeted. \"Look out! Don't agree to anything. Don't let them\r\nfool you.\"\r\n\r\nLou was apt to be fooled himself. He had not yet learned to keep\r\naway from the shell-game wagons that followed the circus.\r\n\r\nAfter supper Lou put on a necktie and went across the fields to\r\ncourt Annie Lee, and Carl and Oscar sat down to a game of checkers,\r\nwhile Alexandra read \"The Swiss Family Robinson\" aloud to her mother\r\nand Emil. It was not long before the two boys at the table neglected\r\ntheir game to listen. They were all big children together, and they\r\nfound the adventures of the family in the tree house so absorbing\r\nthat they gave them their undivided attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nAlexandra and Emil spent five days down among the river farms,\r\ndriving up and down the valley. Alexandra talked to the men about\r\ntheir crops and to the women about their poultry. She spent a\r\nwhole day with one young farmer who had been away at school, and\r\nwho was experimenting with a new kind of clover hay. She learned\r\na great deal. As they drove along, she and Emil talked and planned.\r\nAt last, on the sixth day, Alexandra turned Brigham's head northward\r\nand left the river behind.\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing in it for us down there, Emil. There are a few\r\nfine farms, but they are owned by the rich men in town, and couldn't\r\nbe bought. Most of the land is rough and hilly. They can always\r\nscrape along down there, but they can never do anything big. Down\r\nthere they have a little certainty, but up with us there is a big\r\nchance. We must have faith in the high land, Emil. I want to hold\r\non harder than ever, and when you're a man you'll thank me.\" She\r\nurged Brigham forward.\r\n\r\nWhen the road began to climb the first long swells of the Divide,\r\nAlexandra hummed an old Swedish hymn, and Emil wondered why his\r\nsister looked so happy. Her face was so radiant that he felt shy\r\nabout asking her. For the first time, perhaps, since that land\r\nemerged from the waters of geologic ages, a human face was set toward\r\nit with love and yearning. It seemed beautiful to her, rich and\r\nstrong and glorious. Her eyes drank in the breadth of it, until\r\nher tears blinded her. Then the Genius of the Divide, the great,\r\nfree spirit which breathes across it, must have bent lower than\r\nit ever bent to a human will before. The history of every country\r\nbegins in the heart of a man or a woman.\r\n\r\nAlexandra reached home in the afternoon. That evening she held\r\na family council and told her brothers all that she had seen and\r\nheard.\r\n\r\n\"I want you boys to go down yourselves and look it over. Nothing\r\nwill convince you like seeing with your own eyes. The river land\r\nwas settled before this, and so they are a few years ahead of us,\r\nand have learned more about farming. The land sells for three\r\ntimes as much as this, but in five years we will double it. The\r\nrich men down there own all the best land, and they are buying\r\nall they can get. The thing to do is to sell our cattle and what\r\nlittle old corn we have, and buy the Linstrum place. Then the next\r\nthing to do is to take out two loans on our half-sections, and buy\r\nPeter Crow's place; raise every dollar we can, and buy every acre\r\nwe can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mortgage the homestead again?\" Lou cried. He sprang up and began\r\nto wind the clock furiously. \"I won't slave to pay off another\r\nmortgage. I'll never do it. You'd just as soon kill us all,\r\nAlexandra, to carry out some scheme!\"\r\n\r\nOscar rubbed his high, pale forehead. \"How do you propose to pay\r\noff your mortgages?\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra looked from one to the other and bit her lip. They had\r\nnever seen her so nervous. \"See here,\" she brought out at last.\r\n\"We borrow the money for six years. Well, with the money we buy\r\na half-section from Linstrum and a half from Crow, and a quarter\r\nfrom Struble, maybe. That will give us upwards of fourteen hundred\r\nacres, won't it? You won't have to pay off your mortgages for six\r\nyears. By that time, any of this land will be worth thirty dollars\r\nan acre--it will be worth fifty, but we'll say thirty; then you\r\ncan sell a garden patch anywhere, and pay off a debt of sixteen\r\nhundred dollars. It's not the principal I'm worried about, it's\r\nthe interest and taxes. We'll have to strain to meet the payments.\r\nBut as sure as we are sitting here to-night, we can sit down here\r\nten years from now independent landowners, not struggling farmers\r\nany longer. The chance that father was always looking for has\r\ncome.\"\r\n\r\nLou was pacing the floor. \"But how do you KNOW that land is going\r\nto go up enough to pay the mortgages and--\"\r\n\r\n\"And make us rich besides?\" Alexandra put in firmly. \"I can't\r\nexplain that, Lou. You'll have to take my word for it. I KNOW,\r\nthat's all. When you drive about over the country you can feel it\r\ncoming.\"\r\n\r\nOscar had been sitting with his head lowered, his hands hanging\r\nbetween his knees. \"But we can't work so much land,\" he said\r\ndully, as if he were talking to himself. \"We can't even try. It\r\nwould just lie there and we'd work ourselves to death.\" He sighed,\r\nand laid his calloused fist on the table.\r\n\r\nAlexandra's eyes filled with tears. She put her hand on his\r\nshoulder. \"You poor boy, you won't have to work it. The men in\r\ntown who are buying up other people's land don't try to farm it.\r\nThey are the men to watch, in a new country. Let's try to do\r\nlike the shrewd ones, and not like these stupid fellows. I don't\r\nwant you boys always to have to work like this. I want you to be\r\nindependent, and Emil to go to school.\"\r\n\r\nLou held his head as if it were splitting. \"Everybody will say we\r\nare crazy. It must be crazy, or everybody would be doing it.\"\r\n\r\n\"If they were, we wouldn't have much chance. No, Lou, I was talking\r\nabout that with the smart young man who is raising the new kind\r\nof clover. He says the right thing is usually just what everybody\r\ndon't do. Why are we better fixed than any of our neighbors? Because\r\nfather had more brains. Our people were better people than these\r\nin the old country. We OUGHT to do more than they do, and see\r\nfurther ahead. Yes, mother, I'm going to clear the table now.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra rose. The boys went to the stable to see to the stock,\r\nand they were gone a long while. When they came back Lou played on\r\nhis DRAGHARMONIKA and Oscar sat figuring at his father's secretary\r\nall evening. They said nothing more about Alexandra's project,\r\nbut she felt sure now that they would consent to it. Just before\r\nbedtime Oscar went out for a pail of water. When he did not come\r\nback, Alexandra threw a shawl over her head and ran down the path\r\nto the windmill. She found him sitting there with his head in his\r\nhands, and she sat down beside him.\r\n\r\n\"Don't do anything you don't want to do, Oscar,\" she whispered.\r\nShe waited a moment, but he did not stir. \"I won't say any more\r\nabout it, if you'd rather not. What makes you so discouraged?\"\r\n\r\n\"I dread signing my name to them pieces of paper,\" he said slowly.\r\n\"All the time I was a boy we had a mortgage hanging over us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then don't sign one. I don't want you to, if you feel that way.\"\r\n\r\nOscar shook his head. \"No, I can see there's a chance that way.\r\nI've thought a good while there might be. We're in so deep now, we\r\nmight as well go deeper. But it's hard work pulling out of debt.\r\nLike pulling a threshing-machine out of the mud; breaks your back.\r\nMe and Lou's worked hard, and I can't see it's got us ahead much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody knows about that as well as I do, Oscar. That's why I want\r\nto try an easier way. I don't want you to have to grub for every\r\ndollar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know what you mean. Maybe it'll come out right. But signing\r\npapers is signing papers. There ain't no maybe about that.\" He\r\ntook his pail and trudged up the path to the house.\r\n\r\nAlexandra drew her shawl closer about her and stood leaning against\r\nthe frame of the mill, looking at the stars which glittered so\r\nkeenly through the frosty autumn air. She always loved to watch\r\nthem, to think of their vastness and distance, and of their ordered\r\nmarch. It fortified her to reflect upon the great operations\r\nof nature, and when she thought of the law that lay behind them,\r\nshe felt a sense of personal security. That night she had a new\r\nconsciousness of the country, felt almost a new relation to it.\r\nEven her talk with the boys had not taken away the feeling that had\r\noverwhelmed her when she drove back to the Divide that afternoon.\r\nShe had never known before how much the country meant to her. The\r\nchirping of the insects down in the long grass had been like the\r\nsweetest music. She had felt as if her heart were hiding down\r\nthere, somewhere, with the quail and the plover and all the little\r\nwild things that crooned or buzzed in the sun. Under the long\r\nshaggy ridges, she felt the future stirring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II. Neighboring Fields\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIT is sixteen years since John Bergson died. His wife now lies\r\nbeside him, and the white shaft that marks their graves gleams\r\nacross the wheat-fields. Could he rise from beneath it, he would\r\nnot know the country under which he has been asleep. The shaggy coat\r\nof the prairie, which they lifted to make him a bed, has vanished\r\nforever. From the Norwegian graveyard one looks out over a vast\r\nchecker-board, marked off in squares of wheat and corn; light and\r\ndark, dark and light. Telephone wires hum along the white roads,\r\nwhich always run at right angles. From the graveyard gate one can\r\ncount a dozen gayly painted farmhouses; the gilded weather-vanes\r\non the big red barns wink at each other across the green and brown\r\nand yellow fields. The light steel windmills tremble throughout\r\ntheir frames and tug at their moorings, as they vibrate in the wind\r\nthat often blows from one week's end to another across that high,\r\nactive, resolute stretch of country.\r\n\r\nThe Divide is now thickly populated. The rich soil yields heavy\r\nharvests; the dry, bracing climate and the smoothness of the land\r\nmake labor easy for men and beasts. There are few scenes more\r\ngratifying than a spring plowing in that country, where the furrows\r\nof a single field often lie a mile in length, and the brown earth,\r\nwith such a strong, clean smell, and such a power of growth and\r\nfertility in it, yields itself eagerly to the plow; rolls away\r\nfrom the shear, not even dimming the brightness of the metal, with\r\na soft, deep sigh of happiness. The wheat-cutting sometimes goes\r\non all night as well as all day, and in good seasons there are\r\nscarcely men and horses enough to do the harvesting. The grain is\r\nso heavy that it bends toward the blade and cuts like velvet.\r\n\r\nThere is something frank and joyous and young in the open face\r\nof the country. It gives itself ungrudgingly to the moods of the\r\nseason, holding nothing back. Like the plains of Lombardy, it\r\nseems to rise a little to meet the sun. The air and the earth are\r\ncuriously mated and intermingled, as if the one were the breath\r\nof the other. You feel in the atmosphere the same tonic, puissant\r\nquality that is in the tilth, the same strength and resoluteness.\r\n\r\nOne June morning a young man stood at the gate of the Norwegian\r\ngraveyard, sharpening his scythe in strokes unconsciously timed to\r\nthe tune he was whistling. He wore a flannel cap and duck trousers,\r\nand the sleeves of his white flannel shirt were rolled back to\r\nthe elbow. When he was satisfied with the edge of his blade, he\r\nslipped the whetstone into his hip pocket and began to swing his\r\nscythe, still whistling, but softly, out of respect to the quiet\r\nfolk about him. Unconscious respect, probably, for he seemed\r\nintent upon his own thoughts, and, like the Gladiator's, they were\r\nfar away. He was a splendid figure of a boy, tall and straight\r\nas a young pine tree, with a handsome head, and stormy gray eyes,\r\ndeeply set under a serious brow. The space between his two front\r\nteeth, which were unusually far apart, gave him the proficiency\r\nin whistling for which he was distinguished at college. (He also\r\nplayed the cornet in the University band.)\r\n\r\nWhen the grass required his close attention, or when he had to\r\nstoop to cut about a head-stone, he paused in his lively air,--the\r\n\"Jewel\" song,--taking it up where he had left it when his scythe\r\nswung free again. He was not thinking about the tired pioneers\r\nover whom his blade glittered. The old wild country, the struggle\r\nin which his sister was destined to succeed while so many men broke\r\ntheir hearts and died, he can scarcely remember. That is all among\r\nthe dim things of childhood and has been forgotten in the brighter\r\npattern life weaves to-day, in the bright facts of being captain\r\nof the track team, and holding the interstate record for the high\r\njump, in the all-suffusing brightness of being twenty-one. Yet\r\nsometimes, in the pauses of his work, the young man frowned and\r\nlooked at the ground with an intentness which suggested that even\r\ntwenty-one might have its problems.\r\n\r\nWhen he had been mowing the better part of an hour, he heard the\r\nrattle of a light cart on the road behind him. Supposing that it\r\nwas his sister coming back from one of her farms, he kept on with\r\nhis work. The cart stopped at the gate and a merry contralto voice\r\ncalled, \"Almost through, Emil?\" He dropped his scythe and went\r\ntoward the fence, wiping his face and neck with his handkerchief.\r\nIn the cart sat a young woman who wore driving gauntlets and a wide\r\nshade hat, trimmed with red poppies. Her face, too, was rather\r\nlike a poppy, round and brown, with rich color in her cheeks and\r\nlips, and her dancing yellow-brown eyes bubbled with gayety. The\r\nwind was flapping her big hat and teasing a curl of her chestnut-colored\r\nhair. She shook her head at the tall youth.\r\n\r\n\"What time did you get over here? That's not much of a job for\r\nan athlete. Here I've been to town and back. Alexandra lets you\r\nsleep late. Oh, I know! Lou's wife was telling me about the way\r\nshe spoils you. I was going to give you a lift, if you were done.\"\r\nShe gathered up her reins.\r\n\r\n\"But I will be, in a minute. Please wait for me, Marie,\" Emil\r\ncoaxed. \"Alexandra sent me to mow our lot, but I've done half a\r\ndozen others, you see. Just wait till I finish off the Kourdnas'.\r\nBy the way, they were Bohemians. Why aren't they up in the Catholic\r\ngraveyard?\"\r\n\r\n\"Free-thinkers,\" replied the young woman laconically.\r\n\r\n\"Lots of the Bohemian boys at the University are,\" said Emil, taking\r\nup his scythe again. \"What did you ever burn John Huss for, anyway?\r\nIt's made an awful row. They still jaw about it in history classes.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd do it right over again, most of us,\" said the young woman\r\nhotly. \"Don't they ever teach you in your history classes that\r\nyou'd all be heathen Turks if it hadn't been for the Bohemians?\"\r\n\r\nEmil had fallen to mowing. \"Oh, there's no denying you're a spunky\r\nlittle bunch, you Czechs,\" he called back over his shoulder.\r\n\r\nMarie Shabata settled herself in her seat and watched the rhythmical\r\nmovement of the young man's long arms, swinging her foot as if\r\nin time to some air that was going through her mind. The minutes\r\npassed. Emil mowed vigorously and Marie sat sunning herself and\r\nwatching the long grass fall. She sat with the ease that belongs\r\nto persons of an essentially happy nature, who can find a comfortable\r\nspot almost anywhere; who are supple, and quick in adapting themselves\r\nto circumstances. After a final swish, Emil snapped the gate and\r\nsprang into the cart, holding his scythe well out over the wheel.\r\n\"There,\" he sighed. \"I gave old man Lee a cut or so, too. Lou's\r\nwife needn't talk. I never see Lou's scythe over here.\"\r\n\r\nMarie clucked to her horse. \"Oh, you know Annie!\" She looked at\r\nthe young man's bare arms. \"How brown you've got since you came\r\nhome. I wish I had an athlete to mow my orchard. I get wet to my\r\nknees when I go down to pick cherries.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can have one, any time you want him. Better wait until after\r\nit rains.\" Emil squinted off at the horizon as if he were looking\r\nfor clouds.\r\n\r\n\"Will you? Oh, there's a good boy!\" She turned her head to him\r\nwith a quick, bright smile. He felt it rather than saw it. Indeed,\r\nhe had looked away with the purpose of not seeing it. \"I've been\r\nup looking at Angelique's wedding clothes,\" Marie went on, \"and\r\nI'm so excited I can hardly wait until Sunday. Amedee will be\r\na handsome bridegroom. Is anybody but you going to stand up with\r\nhim? Well, then it will be a handsome wedding party.\" She made a\r\ndroll face at Emil, who flushed. \"Frank,\" Marie continued, flicking\r\nher horse, \"is cranky at me because I loaned his saddle to Jan\r\nSmirka, and I'm terribly afraid he won't take me to the dance in\r\nthe evening. Maybe the supper will tempt him. All Angelique's\r\nfolks are baking for it, and all Amedee's twenty cousins. There\r\nwill be barrels of beer. If once I get Frank to the supper, I'll\r\nsee that I stay for the dance. And by the way, Emil, you mustn't\r\ndance with me but once or twice. You must dance with all the French\r\ngirls. It hurts their feelings if you don't. They think you're\r\nproud because you've been away to school or something.\"\r\n\r\nEmil sniffed. \"How do you know they think that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you didn't dance with them much at Raoul Marcel's party, and\r\nI could tell how they took it by the way they looked at you--and\r\nat me.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Emil shortly, studying the glittering blade of\r\nhis scythe.\r\n\r\nThey drove westward toward Norway Creek, and toward a big white\r\nhouse that stood on a hill, several miles across the fields. There\r\nwere so many sheds and outbuildings grouped about it that the\r\nplace looked not unlike a tiny village. A stranger, approaching\r\nit, could not help noticing the beauty and fruitfulness of the\r\noutlying fields. There was something individual about the great\r\nfarm, a most unusual trimness and care for detail. On either side\r\nof the road, for a mile before you reached the foot of the hill,\r\nstood tall osage orange hedges, their glossy green marking off\r\nthe yellow fields. South of the hill, in a low, sheltered swale,\r\nsurrounded by a mulberry hedge, was the orchard, its fruit trees\r\nknee-deep in timothy grass. Any one thereabouts would have told\r\nyou that this was one of the richest farms on the Divide, and that\r\nthe farmer was a woman, Alexandra Bergson.\r\n\r\nIf you go up the hill and enter Alexandra's big house, you will\r\nfind that it is curiously unfinished and uneven in comfort. One\r\nroom is papered, carpeted, over-furnished; the next is almost\r\nbare. The pleasantest rooms in the house are the kitchen--where\r\nAlexandra's three young Swedish girls chatter and cook and pickle\r\nand preserve all summer long--and the sitting-room, in which\r\nAlexandra has brought together the old homely furniture that the\r\nBergsons used in their first log house, the family portraits, and\r\nthe few things her mother brought from Sweden.\r\n\r\nWhen you go out of the house into the flower garden, there you feel\r\nagain the order and fine arrangement manifest all over the great\r\nfarm; in the fencing and hedging, in the windbreaks and sheds, in\r\nthe symmetrical pasture ponds, planted with scrub willows to give\r\nshade to the cattle in fly-time. There is even a white row of\r\nbeehives in the orchard, under the walnut trees. You feel that,\r\nproperly, Alexandra's house is the big out-of-doors, and that it\r\nis in the soil that she expresses herself best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nEmil reached home a little past noon, and when he went into the\r\nkitchen Alexandra was already seated at the head of the long table,\r\nhaving dinner with her men, as she always did unless there were\r\nvisitors. He slipped into his empty place at his sister's right.\r\nThe three pretty young Swedish girls who did Alexandra's housework\r\nwere cutting pies, refilling coffeecups, placing platters of bread\r\nand meat and potatoes upon the red tablecloth, and continually\r\ngetting in each other's way between the table and the stove. To be\r\nsure they always wasted a good deal of time getting in each other's\r\nway and giggling at each other's mistakes. But, as Alexandra had\r\npointedly told her sisters-in-law, it was to hear them giggle that\r\nshe kept three young things in her kitchen; the work she could\r\ndo herself, if it were necessary. These girls, with their long\r\nletters from home, their finery, and their love-affairs, afforded\r\nher a great deal of entertainment, and they were company for her\r\nwhen Emil was away at school.\r\n\r\nOf the youngest girl, Signa, who has a pretty figure, mottled pink\r\ncheeks, and yellow hair, Alexandra is very fond, though she keeps\r\na sharp eye upon her. Signa is apt to be skittish at mealtime, when\r\nthe men are about, and to spill the coffee or upset the cream. It\r\nis supposed that Nelse Jensen, one of the six men at the dinner-table,\r\nis courting Signa, though he has been so careful not to commit\r\nhimself that no one in the house, least of all Signa, can tell\r\njust how far the matter has progressed. Nelse watches her glumly\r\nas she waits upon the table, and in the evening he sits on a bench\r\nbehind the stove with his DRAGHARMONIKA, playing mournful airs\r\nand watching her as she goes about her work. When Alexandra asked\r\nSigna whether she thought Nelse was in earnest, the poor child hid\r\nher hands under her apron and murmured, \"I don't know, ma'm. But\r\nhe scolds me about everything, like as if he wanted to have me!\"\r\n\r\nAt Alexandra's left sat a very old man, barefoot and wearing a long\r\nblue blouse, open at the neck. His shaggy head is scarcely whiter\r\nthan it was sixteen years ago, but his little blue eyes have become\r\npale and watery, and his ruddy face is withered, like an apple that\r\nhas clung all winter to the tree. When Ivar lost his land through\r\nmismanagement a dozen years ago, Alexandra took him in, and he has\r\nbeen a member of her household ever since. He is too old to work\r\nin the fields, but he hitches and unhitches the work-teams and\r\nlooks after the health of the stock. Sometimes of a winter evening\r\nAlexandra calls him into the sitting-room to read the Bible aloud\r\nto her, for he still reads very well. He dislikes human habitations,\r\nso Alexandra has fitted him up a room in the barn, where he is very\r\ncomfortable, being near the horses and, as he says, further from\r\ntemptations. No one has ever found out what his temptations are.\r\nIn cold weather he sits by the kitchen fire and makes hammocks\r\nor mends harness until it is time to go to bed. Then he says his\r\nprayers at great length behind the stove, puts on his buffalo-skin\r\ncoat and goes out to his room in the barn.\r\n\r\nAlexandra herself has changed very little. Her figure is fuller,\r\nand she has more color. She seems sunnier and more vigorous than\r\nshe did as a young girl. But she still has the same calmness and\r\ndeliberation of manner, the same clear eyes, and she still wears\r\nher hair in two braids wound round her head. It is so curly that\r\nfiery ends escape from the braids and make her head look like one\r\nof the big double sunflowers that fringe her vegetable garden.\r\nHer face is always tanned in summer, for her sunbonnet is oftener\r\non her arm than on her head. But where her collar falls away from\r\nher neck, or where her sleeves are pushed back from her wrist, the\r\nskin is of such smoothness and whiteness as none but Swedish women\r\never possess; skin with the freshness of the snow itself.\r\n\r\nAlexandra did not talk much at the table, but she encouraged her\r\nmen to talk, and she always listened attentively, even when they\r\nseemed to be talking foolishly.\r\n\r\nTo-day Barney Flinn, the big red-headed Irishman who had been with\r\nAlexandra for five years and who was actually her foreman, though\r\nhe had no such title, was grumbling about the new silo she had put\r\nup that spring. It happened to be the first silo on the Divide,\r\nand Alexandra's neighbors and her men were skeptical about it. \"To\r\nbe sure, if the thing don't work, we'll have plenty of feed without\r\nit, indeed,\" Barney conceded.\r\n\r\nNelse Jensen, Signa's gloomy suitor, had his word. \"Lou, he says\r\nhe wouldn't have no silo on his place if you'd give it to him.\r\nHe says the feed outen it gives the stock the bloat. He heard of\r\nsomebody lost four head of horses, feedin' 'em that stuff.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra looked down the table from one to another. \"Well,\r\nthe only way we can find out is to try. Lou and I have different\r\nnotions about feeding stock, and that's a good thing. It's bad if\r\nall the members of a family think alike. They never get anywhere.\r\nLou can learn by my mistakes and I can learn by his. Isn't that\r\nfair, Barney?\"\r\n\r\nThe Irishman laughed. He had no love for Lou, who was always uppish\r\nwith him and who said that Alexandra paid her hands too much. \"I've\r\nno thought but to give the thing an honest try, mum. 'T would be\r\nonly right, after puttin' so much expense into it. Maybe Emil will\r\ncome out an' have a look at it wid me.\" He pushed back his chair,\r\ntook his hat from the nail, and marched out with Emil, who, with\r\nhis university ideas, was supposed to have instigated the silo.\r\nThe other hands followed them, all except old Ivar. He had been\r\ndepressed throughout the meal and had paid no heed to the talk of\r\nthe men, even when they mentioned cornstalk bloat, upon which he\r\nwas sure to have opinions.\r\n\r\n\"Did you want to speak to me, Ivar?\" Alexandra asked as she rose\r\nfrom the table. \"Come into the sitting-room.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man followed Alexandra, but when she motioned him to a chair\r\nhe shook his head. She took up her workbasket and waited for him\r\nto speak. He stood looking at the carpet, his bushy head bowed,\r\nhis hands clasped in front of him. Ivar's bandy legs seemed to\r\nhave grown shorter with years, and they were completely misfitted\r\nto his broad, thick body and heavy shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Ivar, what is it?\" Alexandra asked after she had waited\r\nlonger than usual.\r\n\r\nIvar had never learned to speak English and his Norwegian was quaint\r\nand grave, like the speech of the more old-fashioned people. He\r\nalways addressed Alexandra in terms of the deepest respect, hoping\r\nto set a good example to the kitchen girls, whom he thought too\r\nfamiliar in their manners.\r\n\r\n\"Mistress,\" he began faintly, without raising his eyes, \"the folk\r\nhave been looking coldly at me of late. You know there has been\r\ntalk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Talk about what, Ivar?\"\r\n\r\n\"About sending me away; to the asylum.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra put down her sewing-basket. \"Nobody has come to me with\r\nsuch talk,\" she said decidedly. \"Why need you listen? You know\r\nI would never consent to such a thing.\"\r\n\r\nIvar lifted his shaggy head and looked at her out of his little\r\neyes. \"They say that you cannot prevent it if the folk complain of\r\nme, if your brothers complain to the authorities. They say that\r\nyour brothers are afraid--God forbid!--that I may do you some\r\ninjury when my spells are on me. Mistress, how can any one think\r\nthat?--that I could bite the hand that fed me!\" The tears trickled\r\ndown on the old man's beard.\r\n\r\nAlexandra frowned. \"Ivar, I wonder at you, that you should come\r\nbothering me with such nonsense. I am still running my own house,\r\nand other people have nothing to do with either you or me. So long\r\nas I am suited with you, there is nothing to be said.\"\r\n\r\nIvar pulled a red handkerchief out of the breast of his blouse and\r\nwiped his eyes and beard. \"But I should not wish you to keep me\r\nif, as they say, it is against your interests, and if it is hard\r\nfor you to get hands because I am here.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra made an impatient gesture, but the old man put out his\r\nhand and went on earnestly:--\r\n\r\n\"Listen, mistress, it is right that you should take these things\r\ninto account. You know that my spells come from God, and that\r\nI would not harm any living creature. You believe that every one\r\nshould worship God in the way revealed to him. But that is not\r\nthe way of this country. The way here is for all to do alike. I\r\nam despised because I do not wear shoes, because I do not cut my\r\nhair, and because I have visions. At home, in the old country,\r\nthere were many like me, who had been touched by God, or who had\r\nseen things in the graveyard at night and were different afterward.\r\nWe thought nothing of it, and let them alone. But here, if a man\r\nis different in his feet or in his head, they put him in the asylum.\r\nLook at Peter Kralik; when he was a boy, drinking out of a creek,\r\nhe swallowed a snake, and always after that he could eat only\r\nsuch food as the creature liked, for when he ate anything else, it\r\nbecame enraged and gnawed him. When he felt it whipping about in\r\nhim, he drank alcohol to stupefy it and get some ease for himself.\r\nHe could work as good as any man, and his head was clear, but they\r\nlocked him up for being different in his stomach. That is the way;\r\nthey have built the asylum for people who are different, and they\r\nwill not even let us live in the holes with the badgers. Only\r\nyour great prosperity has protected me so far. If you had had\r\nill-fortune, they would have taken me to Hastings long ago.\"\r\n\r\nAs Ivar talked, his gloom lifted. Alexandra had found that she\r\ncould often break his fasts and long penances by talking to him\r\nand letting him pour out the thoughts that troubled him. Sympathy\r\nalways cleared his mind, and ridicule was poison to him.\r\n\r\n\"There is a great deal in what you say, Ivar. Like as not they\r\nwill be wanting to take me to Hastings because I have built a silo;\r\nand then I may take you with me. But at present I need you here.\r\nOnly don't come to me again telling me what people say. Let people\r\ngo on talking as they like, and we will go on living as we think\r\nbest. You have been with me now for twelve years, and I have gone\r\nto you for advice oftener than I have ever gone to any one. That\r\nought to satisfy you.\"\r\n\r\nIvar bowed humbly. \"Yes, mistress, I shall not trouble you with\r\ntheir talk again. And as for my feet, I have observed your wishes\r\nall these years, though you have never questioned me; washing them\r\nevery night, even in winter.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra laughed. \"Oh, never mind about your feet, Ivar. We can\r\nremember when half our neighbors went barefoot in summer. I expect\r\nold Mrs. Lee would love to slip her shoes off now sometimes, if\r\nshe dared. I'm glad I'm not Lou's mother-in-law.\"\r\n\r\nIvar looked about mysteriously and lowered his voice almost to a\r\nwhisper. \"You know what they have over at Lou's house? A great\r\nwhite tub, like the stone water-troughs in the old country, to wash\r\nthemselves in. When you sent me over with the strawberries, they\r\nwere all in town but the old woman Lee and the baby. She took me\r\nin and showed me the thing, and she told me it was impossible to\r\nwash yourself clean in it, because, in so much water, you could\r\nnot make a strong suds. So when they fill it up and send her in\r\nthere, she pretends, and makes a splashing noise. Then, when they\r\nare all asleep, she washes herself in a little wooden tub she keeps\r\nunder her bed.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra shook with laughter. \"Poor old Mrs. Lee! They won't let\r\nher wear nightcaps, either. Never mind; when she comes to visit\r\nme, she can do all the old things in the old way, and have as much\r\nbeer as she wants. We'll start an asylum for old-time people,\r\nIvar.\"\r\n\r\nIvar folded his big handkerchief carefully and thrust it back into\r\nhis blouse. \"This is always the way, mistress. I come to you\r\nsorrowing, and you send me away with a light heart. And will you\r\nbe so good as to tell the Irishman that he is not to work the brown\r\ngelding until the sore on its shoulder is healed?\"\r\n\r\n\"That I will. Now go and put Emil's mare to the cart. I am going\r\nto drive up to the north quarter to meet the man from town who is\r\nto buy my alfalfa hay.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAlexandra was to hear more of Ivar's case, however. On Sunday her\r\nmarried brothers came to dinner. She had asked them for that day\r\nbecause Emil, who hated family parties, would be absent, dancing\r\nat Amedee Chevalier's wedding, up in the French country. The table\r\nwas set for company in the dining-room, where highly varnished\r\nwood and colored glass and useless pieces of china were conspicuous\r\nenough to satisfy the standards of the new prosperity. Alexandra\r\nhad put herself into the hands of the Hanover furniture dealer, and\r\nhe had conscientiously done his best to make her dining-room look\r\nlike his display window. She said frankly that she knew nothing\r\nabout such things, and she was willing to be governed by the general\r\nconviction that the more useless and utterly unusable objects\r\nwere, the greater their virtue as ornament. That seemed reasonable\r\nenough. Since she liked plain things herself, it was all the more\r\nnecessary to have jars and punchbowls and candlesticks in the company\r\nrooms for people who did appreciate them. Her guests liked to see\r\nabout them these reassuring emblems of prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe family party was complete except for Emil, and Oscar's wife\r\nwho, in the country phrase, \"was not going anywhere just now.\"\r\nOscar sat at the foot of the table and his four tow-headed little\r\nboys, aged from twelve to five, were ranged at one side. Neither\r\nOscar nor Lou has changed much; they have simply, as Alexandra said\r\nof them long ago, grown to be more and more like themselves. Lou\r\nnow looks the older of the two; his face is thin and shrewd and\r\nwrinkled about the eyes, while Oscar's is thick and dull. For all\r\nhis dullness, however, Oscar makes more money than his brother,\r\nwhich adds to Lou's sharpness and uneasiness and tempts him to\r\nmake a show. The trouble with Lou is that he is tricky, and his\r\nneighbors have found out that, as Ivar says, he has not a fox's face\r\nfor nothing. Politics being the natural field for such talents,\r\nhe neglects his farm to attend conventions and to run for county\r\noffices.\r\n\r\nLou's wife, formerly Annie Lee, has grown to look curiously like\r\nher husband. Her face has become longer, sharper, more aggressive.\r\nShe wears her yellow hair in a high pompadour, and is bedecked with\r\nrings and chains and \"beauty pins.\" Her tight, high-heeled shoes\r\ngive her an awkward walk, and she is always more or less preoccupied\r\nwith her clothes. As she sat at the table, she kept telling her\r\nyoungest daughter to \"be careful now, and not drop anything on\r\nmother.\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation at the table was all in English. Oscar's wife,\r\nfrom the malaria district of Missouri, was ashamed of marrying a\r\nforeigner, and his boys do not understand a word of Swedish. Annie\r\nand Lou sometimes speak Swedish at home, but Annie is almost as\r\nmuch afraid of being \"caught\" at it as ever her mother was of being\r\ncaught barefoot. Oscar still has a thick accent, but Lou speaks\r\nlike anybody from Iowa.\r\n\r\n\"When I was in Hastings to attend the convention,\" he was saying,\r\n\"I saw the superintendent of the asylum, and I was telling him about\r\nIvar's symptoms. He says Ivar's case is one of the most dangerous\r\nkind, and it's a wonder he hasn't done something violent before\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra laughed good-humoredly. \"Oh, nonsense, Lou! The doctors\r\nwould have us all crazy if they could. Ivar's queer, certainly,\r\nbut he has more sense than half the hands I hire.\"\r\n\r\nLou flew at his fried chicken. \"Oh, I guess the doctor knows his\r\nbusiness, Alexandra. He was very much surprised when I told him\r\nhow you'd put up with Ivar. He says he's likely to set fire to the\r\nbarn any night, or to take after you and the girls with an axe.\"\r\n\r\nLittle Signa, who was waiting on the table, giggled and fled to\r\nthe kitchen. Alexandra's eyes twinkled. \"That was too much for\r\nSigna, Lou. We all know that Ivar's perfectly harmless. The girls\r\nwould as soon expect me to chase them with an axe.\"\r\n\r\nLou flushed and signaled to his wife. \"All the same, the neighbors\r\nwill be having a say about it before long. He may burn anybody's\r\nbarn. It's only necessary for one property-owner in the township\r\nto make complaint, and he'll be taken up by force. You'd better\r\nsend him yourself and not have any hard feelings.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra helped one of her little nephews to gravy. \"Well, Lou,\r\nif any of the neighbors try that, I'll have myself appointed Ivar's\r\nguardian and take the case to court, that's all. I am perfectly\r\nsatisfied with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pass the preserves, Lou,\" said Annie in a warning tone. She had\r\nreasons for not wishing her husband to cross Alexandra too openly.\r\n\"But don't you sort of hate to have people see him around here,\r\nAlexandra?\" she went on with persuasive smoothness. \"He IS a\r\ndisgraceful object, and you're fixed up so nice now. It sort of\r\nmakes people distant with you, when they never know when they'll\r\nhear him scratching about. My girls are afraid as death of him,\r\naren't you, Milly, dear?\"\r\n\r\nMilly was fifteen, fat and jolly and pompadoured, with a creamy\r\ncomplexion, square white teeth, and a short upper lip. She\r\nlooked like her grandmother Bergson, and had her comfortable and\r\ncomfort-loving nature. She grinned at her aunt, with whom she was\r\na great deal more at ease than she was with her mother. Alexandra\r\nwinked a reply.\r\n\r\n\"Milly needn't be afraid of Ivar. She's an especial favorite of\r\nhis. In my opinion Ivar has just as much right to his own way of\r\ndressing and thinking as we have. But I'll see that he doesn't\r\nbother other people. I'll keep him at home, so don't trouble any\r\nmore about him, Lou. I've been wanting to ask you about your new\r\nbathtub. How does it work?\"\r\n\r\nAnnie came to the fore to give Lou time to recover himself. \"Oh,\r\nit works something grand! I can't keep him out of it. He washes\r\nhimself all over three times a week now, and uses all the hot water.\r\nI think it's weakening to stay in as long as he does. You ought\r\nto have one, Alexandra.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm thinking of it. I might have one put in the barn for Ivar,\r\nif it will ease people's minds. But before I get a bathtub, I'm\r\ngoing to get a piano for Milly.\"\r\n\r\nOscar, at the end of the table, looked up from his plate. \"What\r\ndoes Milly want of a pianny? What's the matter with her organ?\r\nShe can make some use of that, and play in church.\"\r\n\r\nAnnie looked flustered. She had begged Alexandra not to say\r\nanything about this plan before Oscar, who was apt to be jealous\r\nof what his sister did for Lou's children. Alexandra did not get\r\non with Oscar's wife at all. \"Milly can play in church just the\r\nsame, and she'll still play on the organ. But practising on it\r\nso much spoils her touch. Her teacher says so,\" Annie brought out\r\nwith spirit.\r\n\r\nOscar rolled his eyes. \"Well, Milly must have got on pretty good\r\nif she's got past the organ. I know plenty of grown folks that\r\nain't,\" he said bluntly.\r\n\r\nAnnie threw up her chin. \"She has got on good, and she's going to\r\nplay for her commencement when she graduates in town next year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Alexandra firmly, \"I think Milly deserves a piano.\r\nAll the girls around here have been taking lessons for years, but\r\nMilly is the only one of them who can ever play anything when you\r\nask her. I'll tell you when I first thought I would like to give\r\nyou a piano, Milly, and that was when you learned that book of old\r\nSwedish songs that your grandfather used to sing. He had a sweet\r\ntenor voice, and when he was a young man he loved to sing. I can\r\nremember hearing him singing with the sailors down in the shipyard,\r\nwhen I was no bigger than Stella here,\" pointing to Annie's younger\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nMilly and Stella both looked through the door into the sitting-room,\r\nwhere a crayon portrait of John Bergson hung on the wall. Alexandra\r\nhad had it made from a little photograph, taken for his friends\r\njust before he left Sweden; a slender man of thirty-five, with\r\nsoft hair curling about his high forehead, a drooping mustache,\r\nand wondering, sad eyes that looked forward into the distance, as\r\nif they already beheld the New World.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Lou and Oscar went to the orchard to pick cherries--they\r\nhad neither of them had the patience to grow an orchard of their\r\nown--and Annie went down to gossip with Alexandra's kitchen girls\r\nwhile they washed the dishes. She could always find out more about\r\nAlexandra's domestic economy from the prattling maids than from\r\nAlexandra herself, and what she discovered she used to her own\r\nadvantage with Lou. On the Divide, farmers' daughters no longer\r\nwent out into service, so Alexandra got her girls from Sweden, by\r\npaying their fare over. They stayed with her until they married,\r\nand were replaced by sisters or cousins from the old country.\r\n\r\nAlexandra took her three nieces into the flower garden. She was\r\nfond of the little girls, especially of Milly, who came to spend\r\na week with her aunt now and then, and read aloud to her from the\r\nold books about the house, or listened to stories about the early\r\ndays on the Divide. While they were walking among the flower beds,\r\na buggy drove up the hill and stopped in front of the gate. A man\r\ngot out and stood talking to the driver. The little girls were\r\ndelighted at the advent of a stranger, some one from very far away,\r\nthey knew by his clothes, his gloves, and the sharp, pointed cut\r\nof his dark beard. The girls fell behind their aunt and peeped out\r\nat him from among the castor beans. The stranger came up to the\r\ngate and stood holding his hat in his hand, smiling, while Alexandra\r\nadvanced slowly to meet him. As she approached he spoke in a low,\r\npleasant voice.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you know me, Alexandra? I would have known you, anywhere.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra shaded her eyes with her hand. Suddenly she took a quick\r\nstep forward. \"Can it be!\" she exclaimed with feeling; \"can it be\r\nthat it is Carl Linstrum? Why, Carl, it is!\" She threw out both\r\nher hands and caught his across the gate. \"Sadie, Milly, run tell\r\nyour father and Uncle Oscar that our old friend Carl Linstrum is\r\nhere. Be quick! Why, Carl, how did it happen? I can't believe\r\nthis!\" Alexandra shook the tears from her eyes and laughed.\r\n\r\nThe stranger nodded to his driver, dropped his suitcase inside\r\nthe fence, and opened the gate. \"Then you are glad to see me, and\r\nyou can put me up overnight? I couldn't go through this country\r\nwithout stopping off to have a look at you. How little you have\r\nchanged! Do you know, I was sure it would be like that. You\r\nsimply couldn't be different. How fine you are!\" He stepped back\r\nand looked at her admiringly.\r\n\r\nAlexandra blushed and laughed again. \"But you yourself, Carl--with\r\nthat beard--how could I have known you? You went away a little\r\nboy.\" She reached for his suitcase and when he intercepted her\r\nshe threw up her hands. \"You see, I give myself away. I have only\r\nwomen come to visit me, and I do not know how to behave. Where is\r\nyour trunk?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's in Hanover. I can stay only a few days. I am on my way to\r\nthe coast.\"\r\n\r\nThey started up the path. \"A few days? After all these years!\"\r\nAlexandra shook her finger at him. \"See this, you have walked\r\ninto a trap. You do not get away so easy.\" She put her hand\r\naffectionately on his shoulder. \"You owe me a visit for the sake\r\nof old times. Why must you go to the coast at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I must! I am a fortune hunter. From Seattle I go on to\r\nAlaska.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alaska?\" She looked at him in astonishment. \"Are you going to\r\npaint the Indians?\"\r\n\r\n\"Paint?\" the young man frowned. \"Oh! I'm not a painter, Alexandra.\r\nI'm an engraver. I have nothing to do with painting.\"\r\n\r\n\"But on my parlor wall I have the paintings--\"\r\n\r\nHe interrupted nervously. \"Oh, water-color sketches--done for\r\namusement. I sent them to remind you of me, not because they were\r\ngood. What a wonderful place you have made of this, Alexandra.\"\r\nHe turned and looked back at the wide, map-like prospect of field\r\nand hedge and pasture. \"I would never have believed it could be\r\ndone. I'm disappointed in my own eye, in my imagination.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment Lou and Oscar came up the hill from the orchard.\r\nThey did not quicken their pace when they saw Carl; indeed, they\r\ndid not openly look in his direction. They advanced distrustfully,\r\nand as if they wished the distance were longer.\r\n\r\nAlexandra beckoned to them. \"They think I am trying to fool them.\r\nCome, boys, it's Carl Linstrum, our old Carl!\"\r\n\r\nLou gave the visitor a quick, sidelong glance and thrust out his\r\nhand. \"Glad to see you.\"\r\n\r\nOscar followed with \"How d' do.\" Carl could not tell whether their\r\noffishness came from unfriendliness or from embarrassment. He and\r\nAlexandra led the way to the porch.\r\n\r\n\"Carl,\" Alexandra explained, \"is on his way to Seattle. He is\r\ngoing to Alaska.\"\r\n\r\nOscar studied the visitor's yellow shoes. \"Got business there?\"\r\nhe asked.\r\n\r\nCarl laughed. \"Yes, very pressing business. I'm going there to\r\nget rich. Engraving's a very interesting profession, but a man\r\nnever makes any money at it. So I'm going to try the goldfields.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra felt that this was a tactful speech, and Lou looked up\r\nwith some interest. \"Ever done anything in that line before?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I'm going to join a friend of mine who went out from New\r\nYork and has done well. He has offered to break me in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Turrible cold winters, there, I hear,\" remarked Oscar. \"I thought\r\npeople went up there in the spring.\"\r\n\r\n\"They do. But my friend is going to spend the winter in Seattle and\r\nI am to stay with him there and learn something about prospecting\r\nbefore we start north next year.\"\r\n\r\nLou looked skeptical. \"Let's see, how long have you been away from\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sixteen years. You ought to remember that, Lou, for you were\r\nmarried just after we went away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Going to stay with us some time?\" Oscar asked.\r\n\r\n\"A few days, if Alexandra can keep me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I expect you'll be wanting to see your old place,\" Lou observed\r\nmore cordially. \"You won't hardly know it. But there's a few\r\nchunks of your old sod house left. Alexandra wouldn't never let\r\nFrank Shabata plough over it.\"\r\n\r\nAnnie Lee, who, ever since the visitor was announced, had been\r\ntouching up her hair and settling her lace and wishing she had worn\r\nanother dress, now emerged with her three daughters and introduced\r\nthem. She was greatly impressed by Carl's urban appearance, and\r\nin her excitement talked very loud and threw her head about. \"And\r\nyou ain't married yet? At your age, now! Think of that! You'll\r\nhave to wait for Milly. Yes, we've got a boy, too. The youngest.\r\nHe's at home with his grandma. You must come over to see mother\r\nand hear Milly play. She's the musician of the family. She does\r\npyrography, too. That's burnt wood, you know. You wouldn't believe\r\nwhat she can do with her poker. Yes, she goes to school in town,\r\nand she is the youngest in her class by two years.\"\r\n\r\nMilly looked uncomfortable and Carl took her hand again. He liked\r\nher creamy skin and happy, innocent eyes, and he could see that her\r\nmother's way of talking distressed her. \"I'm sure she's a clever\r\nlittle girl,\" he murmured, looking at her thoughtfully. \"Let me\r\nsee--Ah, it's your mother that she looks like, Alexandra. Mrs.\r\nBergson must have looked just like this when she was a little\r\ngirl. Does Milly run about over the country as you and Alexandra\r\nused to, Annie?\"\r\n\r\nMilly's mother protested. \"Oh, my, no! Things has changed since\r\nwe was girls. Milly has it very different. We are going to rent\r\nthe place and move into town as soon as the girls are old enough\r\nto go out into company. A good many are doing that here now. Lou\r\nis going into business.\"\r\n\r\nLou grinned. \"That's what she says. You better go get your things\r\non. Ivar's hitching up,\" he added, turning to Annie.\r\n\r\nYoung farmers seldom address their wives by name. It is always\r\n\"you,\" or \"she.\"\r\n\r\nHaving got his wife out of the way, Lou sat down on the step and\r\nbegan to whittle. \"Well, what do folks in New York think of William\r\nJennings Bryan?\" Lou began to bluster, as he always did when he\r\ntalked politics. \"We gave Wall Street a scare in ninety-six, all\r\nright, and we're fixing another to hand them. Silver wasn't the\r\nonly issue,\" he nodded mysteriously. \"There's a good many things\r\ngot to be changed. The West is going to make itself heard.\"\r\n\r\nCarl laughed. \"But, surely, it did do that, if nothing else.\"\r\n\r\nLou's thin face reddened up to the roots of his bristly hair. \"Oh,\r\nwe've only begun. We're waking up to a sense of our responsibilities,\r\nout here, and we ain't afraid, neither. You fellows back there\r\nmust be a tame lot. If you had any nerve you'd get together and\r\nmarch down to Wall Street and blow it up. Dynamite it, I mean,\"\r\nwith a threatening nod.\r\n\r\nHe was so much in earnest that Carl scarcely knew how to answer\r\nhim. \"That would be a waste of powder. The same business would\r\ngo on in another street. The street doesn't matter. But what have\r\nyou fellows out here got to kick about? You have the only safe\r\nplace there is. Morgan himself couldn't touch you. One only has\r\nto drive through this country to see that you're all as rich as\r\nbarons.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have a good deal more to say than we had when we were poor,\"\r\nsaid Lou threateningly. \"We're getting on to a whole lot of things.\"\r\n\r\nAs Ivar drove a double carriage up to the gate, Annie came out in\r\na hat that looked like the model of a battleship. Carl rose and\r\ntook her down to the carriage, while Lou lingered for a word with\r\nhis sister.\r\n\r\n\"What do you suppose he's come for?\" he asked, jerking his head\r\ntoward the gate.\r\n\r\n\"Why, to pay us a visit. I've been begging him to for years.\"\r\n\r\nOscar looked at Alexandra. \"He didn't let you know he was coming?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Why should he? I told him to come at any time.\"\r\n\r\nLou shrugged his shoulders. \"He doesn't seem to have done much\r\nfor himself. Wandering around this way!\"\r\n\r\nOscar spoke solemnly, as from the depths of a cavern. \"He never\r\nwas much account.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra left them and hurried down to the gate where Annie was\r\nrattling on to Carl about her new dining-room furniture. \"You\r\nmust bring Mr. Linstrum over real soon, only be sure to telephone\r\nme first,\" she called back, as Carl helped her into the carriage.\r\nOld Ivar, his white head bare, stood holding the horses. Lou came\r\ndown the path and climbed into the front seat, took up the reins,\r\nand drove off without saying anything further to any one. Oscar\r\npicked up his youngest boy and trudged off down the road, the other\r\nthree trotting after him. Carl, holding the gate open for Alexandra,\r\nbegan to laugh. \"Up and coming on the Divide, eh, Alexandra?\" he\r\ncried gayly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nCarl had changed, Alexandra felt, much less than one might have\r\nexpected. He had not become a trim, self-satisfied city man. There\r\nwas still something homely and wayward and definitely personal\r\nabout him. Even his clothes, his Norfolk coat and his very high\r\ncollars, were a little unconventional. He seemed to shrink into\r\nhimself as he used to do; to hold himself away from things, as if\r\nhe were afraid of being hurt. In short, he was more self-conscious\r\nthan a man of thirty-five is expected to be. He looked older than\r\nhis years and not very strong. His black hair, which still hung\r\nin a triangle over his pale forehead, was thin at the crown, and\r\nthere were fine, relentless lines about his eyes. His back, with\r\nits high, sharp shoulders, looked like the back of an over-worked\r\nGerman professor off on his holiday. His face was intelligent,\r\nsensitive, unhappy.\r\n\r\nThat evening after supper, Carl and Alexandra were sitting by the\r\nclump of castor beans in the middle of the flower garden. The\r\ngravel paths glittered in the moonlight, and below them the fields\r\nlay white and still.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, Alexandra,\" he was saying, \"I've been thinking how\r\nstrangely things work out. I've been away engraving other men's\r\npictures, and you've stayed at home and made your own.\" He pointed\r\nwith his cigar toward the sleeping landscape. \"How in the world\r\nhave you done it? How have your neighbors done it?\"\r\n\r\n\"We hadn't any of us much to do with it, Carl. The land did it.\r\nIt had its little joke. It pretended to be poor because nobody\r\nknew how to work it right; and then, all at once, it worked itself.\r\nIt woke up out of its sleep and stretched itself, and it was so big,\r\nso rich, that we suddenly found we were rich, just from sitting\r\nstill. As for me, you remember when I began to buy land. For\r\nyears after that I was always squeezing and borrowing until I was\r\nashamed to show my face in the banks. And then, all at once, men\r\nbegan to come to me offering to lend me money--and I didn't need\r\nit! Then I went ahead and built this house. I really built it\r\nfor Emil. I want you to see Emil, Carl. He is so different from\r\nthe rest of us!\"\r\n\r\n\"How different?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you'll see! I'm sure it was to have sons like Emil, and to\r\ngive them a chance, that father left the old country. It's curious,\r\ntoo; on the outside Emil is just like an American boy,--he graduated\r\nfrom the State University in June, you know,--but underneath he is\r\nmore Swedish than any of us. Sometimes he is so like father that\r\nhe frightens me; he is so violent in his feelings like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he going to farm here with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"He shall do whatever he wants to,\" Alexandra declared warmly. \"He\r\nis going to have a chance, a whole chance; that's what I've worked\r\nfor. Sometimes he talks about studying law, and sometimes, just\r\nlately, he's been talking about going out into the sand hills and\r\ntaking up more land. He has his sad times, like father. But I\r\nhope he won't do that. We have land enough, at last!\" Alexandra\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\"How about Lou and Oscar? They've done well, haven't they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, very well; but they are different, and now that they have\r\nfarms of their own I do not see so much of them. We divided the\r\nland equally when Lou married. They have their own way of doing\r\nthings, and they do not altogether like my way, I am afraid. Perhaps\r\nthey think me too independent. But I have had to think for myself\r\na good many years and am not likely to change. On the whole,\r\nthough, we take as much comfort in each other as most brothers and\r\nsisters do. And I am very fond of Lou's oldest daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I liked the old Lou and Oscar better, and they probably\r\nfeel the same about me. I even, if you can keep a secret,\"--Carl\r\nleaned forward and touched her arm, smiling,--\"I even think I liked\r\nthe old country better. This is all very splendid in its way,\r\nbut there was something about this country when it was a wild old\r\nbeast that has haunted me all these years. Now, when I come back\r\nto all this milk and honey, I feel like the old German song, 'Wo\r\nbist du, wo bist du, mein geliebtest Land?'--Do you ever feel like\r\nthat, I wonder?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sometimes, when I think about father and mother and those\r\nwho are gone; so many of our old neighbors.\" Alexandra paused and\r\nlooked up thoughtfully at the stars. \"We can remember the graveyard\r\nwhen it was wild prairie, Carl, and now--\"\r\n\r\n\"And now the old story has begun to write itself over there,\" said\r\nCarl softly. \"Isn't it queer: there are only two or three human\r\nstories, and they go on repeating themselves as fiercely as if they\r\nhad never happened before; like the larks in this country, that\r\nhave been singing the same five notes over for thousands of years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes! The young people, they live so hard. And yet I sometimes\r\nenvy them. There is my little neighbor, now; the people who bought\r\nyour old place. I wouldn't have sold it to any one else, but I\r\nwas always fond of that girl. You must remember her, little Marie\r\nTovesky, from Omaha, who used to visit here? When she was eighteen\r\nshe ran away from the convent school and got married, crazy child!\r\nShe came out here a bride, with her father and husband. He had\r\nnothing, and the old man was willing to buy them a place and set\r\nthem up. Your farm took her fancy, and I was glad to have her so\r\nnear me. I've never been sorry, either. I even try to get along\r\nwith Frank on her account.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Frank her husband?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He's one of these wild fellows. Most Bohemians are\r\ngood-natured, but Frank thinks we don't appreciate him here, I\r\nguess. He's jealous about everything, his farm and his horses and\r\nhis pretty wife. Everybody likes her, just the same as when she\r\nwas little. Sometimes I go up to the Catholic church with Emil,\r\nand it's funny to see Marie standing there laughing and shaking\r\nhands with people, looking so excited and gay, with Frank sulking\r\nbehind her as if he could eat everybody alive. Frank's not a bad\r\nneighbor, but to get on with him you've got to make a fuss over\r\nhim and act as if you thought he was a very important person all\r\nthe time, and different from other people. I find it hard to keep\r\nthat up from one year's end to another.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't think you'd be very successful at that kind of thing,\r\nAlexandra.\" Carl seemed to find the idea amusing.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Alexandra firmly, \"I do the best I can, on Marie's\r\naccount. She has it hard enough, anyway. She's too young and\r\npretty for this sort of life. We're all ever so much older and\r\nslower. But she's the kind that won't be downed easily. She'll\r\nwork all day and go to a Bohemian wedding and dance all night, and\r\ndrive the hay wagon for a cross man next morning. I could stay by\r\na job, but I never had the go in me that she has, when I was going\r\nmy best. I'll have to take you over to see her to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nCarl dropped the end of his cigar softly among the castor beans and\r\nsighed. \"Yes, I suppose I must see the old place. I'm cowardly\r\nabout things that remind me of myself. It took courage to come\r\nat all, Alexandra. I wouldn't have, if I hadn't wanted to see you\r\nvery, very much.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra looked at him with her calm, deliberate eyes. \"Why do\r\nyou dread things like that, Carl?\" she asked earnestly. \"Why are\r\nyou dissatisfied with yourself?\"\r\n\r\nHer visitor winced. \"How direct you are, Alexandra! Just like\r\nyou used to be. Do I give myself away so quickly? Well, you see,\r\nfor one thing, there's nothing to look forward to in my profession.\r\nWood-engraving is the only thing I care about, and that had gone out\r\nbefore I began. Everything's cheap metal work nowadays, touching\r\nup miserable photographs, forcing up poor drawings, and spoiling good\r\nones. I'm absolutely sick of it all.\" Carl frowned. \"Alexandra,\r\nall the way out from New York I've been planning how I could\r\ndeceive you and make you think me a very enviable fellow, and here\r\nI am telling you the truth the first night. I waste a lot of time\r\npretending to people, and the joke of it is, I don't think I ever\r\ndeceive any one. There are too many of my kind; people know us on\r\nsight.\"\r\n\r\nCarl paused. Alexandra pushed her hair back from her brow with a\r\npuzzled, thoughtful gesture. \"You see,\" he went on calmly, \"measured\r\nby your standards here, I'm a failure. I couldn't buy even one of\r\nyour cornfields. I've enjoyed a great many things, but I've got\r\nnothing to show for it all.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you show for it yourself, Carl. I'd rather have had your\r\nfreedom than my land.\"\r\n\r\nCarl shook his head mournfully. \"Freedom so often means that one\r\nisn't needed anywhere. Here you are an individual, you have a\r\nbackground of your own, you would be missed. But off there in the\r\ncities there are thousands of rolling stones like me. We are all\r\nalike; we have no ties, we know nobody, we own nothing. When one\r\nof us dies, they scarcely know where to bury him. Our landlady and\r\nthe delicatessen man are our mourners, and we leave nothing behind\r\nus but a frock-coat and a fiddle, or an easel, or a typewriter, or\r\nwhatever tool we got our living by. All we have ever managed to\r\ndo is to pay our rent, the exorbitant rent that one has to pay for\r\na few square feet of space near the heart of things. We have no\r\nhouse, no place, no people of our own. We live in the streets,\r\nin the parks, in the theatres. We sit in restaurants and concert\r\nhalls and look about at the hundreds of our own kind and shudder.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra was silent. She sat looking at the silver spot the moon\r\nmade on the surface of the pond down in the pasture. He knew that\r\nshe understood what he meant. At last she said slowly, \"And yet I\r\nwould rather have Emil grow up like that than like his two brothers.\r\nWe pay a high rent, too, though we pay differently. We grow hard\r\nand heavy here. We don't move lightly and easily as you do, and\r\nour minds get stiff. If the world were no wider than my cornfields,\r\nif there were not something beside this, I wouldn't feel that it\r\nwas much worth while to work. No, I would rather have Emil like\r\nyou than like them. I felt that as soon as you came.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder why you feel like that?\" Carl mused.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. Perhaps I am like Carrie Jensen, the sister of one\r\nof my hired men. She had never been out of the cornfields, and a\r\nfew years ago she got despondent and said life was just the same\r\nthing over and over, and she didn't see the use of it. After she\r\nhad tried to kill herself once or twice, her folks got worried and\r\nsent her over to Iowa to visit some relations. Ever since she's\r\ncome back she's been perfectly cheerful, and she says she's contented\r\nto live and work in a world that's so big and interesting. She\r\nsaid that anything as big as the bridges over the Platte and the\r\nMissouri reconciled her. And it's what goes on in the world that\r\nreconciles me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nAlexandra did not find time to go to her neighbor's the next day, nor\r\nthe next. It was a busy season on the farm, with the corn-plowing\r\ngoing on, and even Emil was in the field with a team and cultivator.\r\nCarl went about over the farms with Alexandra in the morning, and\r\nin the afternoon and evening they found a great deal to talk about.\r\nEmil, for all his track practice, did not stand up under farmwork\r\nvery well, and by night he was too tired to talk or even to practise\r\non his cornet.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday morning Carl got up before it was light, and stole\r\ndownstairs and out of the kitchen door just as old Ivar was making\r\nhis morning ablutions at the pump. Carl nodded to him and hurried\r\nup the draw, past the garden, and into the pasture where the milking\r\ncows used to be kept.\r\n\r\nThe dawn in the east looked like the light from some great fire that\r\nwas burning under the edge of the world. The color was reflected\r\nin the globules of dew that sheathed the short gray pasture grass.\r\nCarl walked rapidly until he came to the crest of the second hill,\r\nwhere the Bergson pasture joined the one that had belonged to his\r\nfather. There he sat down and waited for the sun to rise. It was\r\njust there that he and Alexandra used to do their milking together, he\r\non his side of the fence, she on hers. He could remember exactly\r\nhow she looked when she came over the close-cropped grass, her\r\nskirts pinned up, her head bare, a bright tin pail in either hand,\r\nand the milky light of the early morning all about her. Even as\r\na boy he used to feel, when he saw her coming with her free step,\r\nher upright head and calm shoulders, that she looked as if she had\r\nwalked straight out of the morning itself. Since then, when he had\r\nhappened to see the sun come up in the country or on the water, he\r\nhad often remembered the young Swedish girl and her milking pails.\r\n\r\nCarl sat musing until the sun leaped above the prairie, and in the\r\ngrass about him all the small creatures of day began to tune their\r\ntiny instruments. Birds and insects without number began to chirp,\r\nto twitter, to snap and whistle, to make all manner of fresh shrill\r\nnoises. The pasture was flooded with light; every clump of ironweed\r\nand snow-on-the-mountain threw a long shadow, and the golden light\r\nseemed to be rippling through the curly grass like the tide racing\r\nin.\r\n\r\nHe crossed the fence into the pasture that was now the Shabatas' and\r\ncontinued his walk toward the pond. He had not gone far, however,\r\nwhen he discovered that he was not the only person abroad. In the\r\ndraw below, his gun in his hands, was Emil, advancing cautiously,\r\nwith a young woman beside him. They were moving softly, keeping\r\nclose together, and Carl knew that they expected to find ducks on\r\nthe pond. At the moment when they came in sight of the bright spot\r\nof water, he heard a whirr of wings and the ducks shot up into the\r\nair. There was a sharp crack from the gun, and five of the birds\r\nfell to the ground. Emil and his companion laughed delightedly,\r\nand Emil ran to pick them up. When he came back, dangling the\r\nducks by their feet, Marie held her apron and he dropped them into\r\nit. As she stood looking down at them, her face changed. She\r\ntook up one of the birds, a rumpled ball of feathers with the blood\r\ndripping slowly from its mouth, and looked at the live color that\r\nstill burned on its plumage.\r\n\r\nAs she let it fall, she cried in distress, \"Oh, Emil, why did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I like that!\" the boy exclaimed indignantly. \"Why, Marie, you\r\nasked me to come yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, I know,\" she said tearfully, \"but I didn't think. I\r\nhate to see them when they are first shot. They were having such\r\na good time, and we've spoiled it all for them.\"\r\n\r\nEmil gave a rather sore laugh. \"I should say we had! I'm not going\r\nhunting with you any more. You're as bad as Ivar. Here, let me\r\ntake them.\" He snatched the ducks out of her apron.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be cross, Emil. Only--Ivar's right about wild things. They're\r\ntoo happy to kill. You can tell just how they felt when they flew\r\nup. They were scared, but they didn't really think anything could\r\nhurt them. No, we won't do that any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" Emil assented. \"I'm sorry I made you feel bad.\" As\r\nhe looked down into her tearful eyes, there was a curious, sharp\r\nyoung bitterness in his own.\r\n\r\nCarl watched them as they moved slowly down the draw. They had\r\nnot seen him at all. He had not overheard much of their dialogue,\r\nbut he felt the import of it. It made him, somehow, unreasonably\r\nmournful to find two young things abroad in the pasture in the\r\nearly morning. He decided that he needed his breakfast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nAt dinner that day Alexandra said she thought they must really\r\nmanage to go over to the Shabatas' that afternoon. \"It's not often\r\nI let three days go by without seeing Marie. She will think I have\r\nforsaken her, now that my old friend has come back.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the men had gone back to work, Alexandra put on a white dress\r\nand her sun-hat, and she and Carl set forth across the fields.\r\n\"You see we have kept up the old path, Carl. It has been so nice\r\nfor me to feel that there was a friend at the other end of it\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nCarl smiled a little ruefully. \"All the same, I hope it hasn't\r\nbeen QUITE the same.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra looked at him with surprise. \"Why, no, of course not.\r\nNot the same. She could not very well take your place, if that's\r\nwhat you mean. I'm friendly with all my neighbors, I hope. But\r\nMarie is really a companion, some one I can talk to quite frankly.\r\nYou wouldn't want me to be more lonely than I have been, would\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\nCarl laughed and pushed back the triangular lock of hair with the\r\nedge of his hat. \"Of course I don't. I ought to be thankful that\r\nthis path hasn't been worn by--well, by friends with more pressing\r\nerrands than your little Bohemian is likely to have.\" He paused\r\nto give Alexandra his hand as she stepped over the stile. \"Are\r\nyou the least bit disappointed in our coming together again?\" he\r\nasked abruptly. \"Is it the way you hoped it would be?\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra smiled at this. \"Only better. When I've thought about\r\nyour coming, I've sometimes been a little afraid of it. You have\r\nlived where things move so fast, and everything is slow here; the\r\npeople slowest of all. Our lives are like the years, all made up\r\nof weather and crops and cows. How you hated cows!\" She shook her\r\nhead and laughed to herself.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't when we milked together. I walked up to the pasture\r\ncorners this morning. I wonder whether I shall ever be able to\r\ntell you all that I was thinking about up there. It's a strange\r\nthing, Alexandra; I find it easy to be frank with you about everything\r\nunder the sun except--yourself!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are afraid of hurting my feelings, perhaps.\" Alexandra looked\r\nat him thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm afraid of giving you a shock. You've seen yourself for\r\nso long in the dull minds of the people about you, that if I were\r\nto tell you how you seem to me, it would startle you. But you must\r\nsee that you astonish me. You must feel when people admire you.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra blushed and laughed with some confusion. \"I felt that\r\nyou were pleased with me, if you mean that.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you've felt when other people were pleased with you?\" he\r\ninsisted.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sometimes. The men in town, at the banks and the county\r\noffices, seem glad to see me. I think, myself, it is more pleasant\r\nto do business with people who are clean and healthy-looking,\" she\r\nadmitted blandly.\r\n\r\nCarl gave a little chuckle as he opened the Shabatas' gate for her.\r\n\"Oh, do you?\" he asked dryly.\r\n\r\nThere was no sign of life about the Shabatas' house except a big\r\nyellow cat, sunning itself on the kitchen doorstep.\r\n\r\nAlexandra took the path that led to the orchard. \"She often sits\r\nthere and sews. I didn't telephone her we were coming, because I\r\ndidn't want her to go to work and bake cake and freeze ice-cream.\r\nShe'll always make a party if you give her the least excuse. Do\r\nyou recognize the apple trees, Carl?\"\r\n\r\nLinstrum looked about him. \"I wish I had a dollar for every bucket\r\nof water I've carried for those trees. Poor father, he was an\r\neasy man, but he was perfectly merciless when it came to watering\r\nthe orchard.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's one thing I like about Germans; they make an orchard grow\r\nif they can't make anything else. I'm so glad these trees belong\r\nto some one who takes comfort in them. When I rented this place,\r\nthe tenants never kept the orchard up, and Emil and I used to come\r\nover and take care of it ourselves. It needs mowing now. There\r\nshe is, down in the corner. Maria-a-a!\" she called.\r\n\r\nA recumbent figure started up from the grass and came running toward\r\nthem through the flickering screen of light and shade.\r\n\r\n\"Look at her! Isn't she like a little brown rabbit?\" Alexandra\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\nMaria ran up panting and threw her arms about Alexandra. \"Oh, I\r\nhad begun to think you were not coming at all, maybe. I knew you\r\nwere so busy. Yes, Emil told me about Mr. Linstrum being here.\r\nWon't you come up to the house?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not sit down there in your corner? Carl wants to see the\r\norchard. He kept all these trees alive for years, watering them\r\nwith his own back.\"\r\n\r\nMarie turned to Carl. \"Then I'm thankful to you, Mr. Linstrum. We'd\r\nnever have bought the place if it hadn't been for this orchard, and\r\nthen I wouldn't have had Alexandra, either.\" She gave Alexandra's\r\narm a little squeeze as she walked beside her. \"How nice your dress\r\nsmells, Alexandra; you put rosemary leaves in your chest, like I\r\ntold you.\"\r\n\r\nShe led them to the northwest corner of the orchard, sheltered on\r\none side by a thick mulberry hedge and bordered on the other by a\r\nwheatfield, just beginning to yellow. In this corner the ground\r\ndipped a little, and the blue-grass, which the weeds had driven out\r\nin the upper part of the orchard, grew thick and luxuriant. Wild\r\nroses were flaming in the tufts of bunchgrass along the fence.\r\nUnder a white mulberry tree there was an old wagon-seat. Beside\r\nit lay a book and a workbasket.\r\n\r\n\"You must have the seat, Alexandra. The grass would stain your\r\ndress,\" the hostess insisted. She dropped down on the ground\r\nat Alexandra's side and tucked her feet under her. Carl sat at\r\na little distance from the two women, his back to the wheatfield,\r\nand watched them. Alexandra took off her shade-hat and threw it on\r\nthe ground. Marie picked it up and played with the white ribbons,\r\ntwisting them about her brown fingers as she talked. They made a\r\npretty picture in the strong sunlight, the leafy pattern surrounding\r\nthem like a net; the Swedish woman so white and gold, kindly and\r\namused, but armored in calm, and the alert brown one, her full lips\r\nparted, points of yellow light dancing in her eyes as she laughed\r\nand chattered. Carl had never forgotten little Marie Tovesky's\r\neyes, and he was glad to have an opportunity to study them. The\r\nbrown iris, he found, was curiously slashed with yellow, the color\r\nof sunflower honey, or of old amber. In each eye one of these\r\nstreaks must have been larger than the others, for the effect was\r\nthat of two dancing points of light, two little yellow bubbles,\r\nsuch as rise in a glass of champagne. Sometimes they seemed like\r\nthe sparks from a forge. She seemed so easily excited, to kindle\r\nwith a fierce little flame if one but breathed upon her. \"What\r\na waste,\" Carl reflected. \"She ought to be doing all that for a\r\nsweetheart. How awkwardly things come about!\"\r\n\r\nIt was not very long before Marie sprang up out of the grass again.\r\n\"Wait a moment. I want to show you something.\" She ran away and\r\ndisappeared behind the low-growing apple trees.\r\n\r\n\"What a charming creature,\" Carl murmured. \"I don't wonder that\r\nher husband is jealous. But can't she walk? does she always run?\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra nodded. \"Always. I don't see many people, but I don't\r\nbelieve there are many like her, anywhere.\"\r\n\r\nMarie came back with a branch she had broken from an apricot tree,\r\nladen with pale yellow, pink-cheeked fruit. She dropped it beside\r\nCarl. \"Did you plant those, too? They are such beautiful little\r\ntrees.\"\r\n\r\nCarl fingered the blue-green leaves, porous like blotting-paper and\r\nshaped like birch leaves, hung on waxen red stems. \"Yes, I think\r\nI did. Are these the circus trees, Alexandra?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I tell her about them?\" Alexandra asked. \"Sit down like\r\na good girl, Marie, and don't ruin my poor hat, and I'll tell you\r\na story. A long time ago, when Carl and I were, say, sixteen and\r\ntwelve, a circus came to Hanover and we went to town in our wagon,\r\nwith Lou and Oscar, to see the parade. We hadn't money enough to\r\ngo to the circus. We followed the parade out to the circus grounds\r\nand hung around until the show began and the crowd went inside the\r\ntent. Then Lou was afraid we looked foolish standing outside in\r\nthe pasture, so we went back to Hanover feeling very sad. There\r\nwas a man in the streets selling apricots, and we had never seen\r\nany before. He had driven down from somewhere up in the French\r\ncountry, and he was selling them twenty-five cents a peck. We had\r\na little money our fathers had given us for candy, and I bought\r\ntwo pecks and Carl bought one. They cheered us a good deal, and\r\nwe saved all the seeds and planted them. Up to the time Carl went\r\naway, they hadn't borne at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now he's come back to eat them,\" cried Marie, nodding at Carl.\r\n\"That IS a good story. I can remember you a little, Mr. Linstrum.\r\nI used to see you in Hanover sometimes, when Uncle Joe took me to\r\ntown. I remember you because you were always buying pencils and\r\ntubes of paint at the drug store. Once, when my uncle left me at\r\nthe store, you drew a lot of little birds and flowers for me on a\r\npiece of wrapping-paper. I kept them for a long while. I thought\r\nyou were very romantic because you could draw and had such black\r\neyes.\"\r\n\r\nCarl smiled. \"Yes, I remember that time. Your uncle bought you\r\nsome kind of a mechanical toy, a Turkish lady sitting on an ottoman\r\nand smoking a hookah, wasn't it? And she turned her head backwards\r\nand forwards.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes! Wasn't she splendid! I knew well enough I ought not\r\nto tell Uncle Joe I wanted it, for he had just come back from the\r\nsaloon and was feeling good. You remember how he laughed? She\r\ntickled him, too. But when we got home, my aunt scolded him for\r\nbuying toys when she needed so many things. We wound our lady up\r\nevery night, and when she began to move her head my aunt used to\r\nlaugh as hard as any of us. It was a music-box, you know, and the\r\nTurkish lady played a tune while she smoked. That was how she made\r\nyou feel so jolly. As I remember her, she was lovely, and had a\r\ngold crescent on her turban.\"\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, as they were leaving the house, Carl and Alexandra\r\nwere met in the path by a strapping fellow in overalls and a blue\r\nshirt. He was breathing hard, as if he had been running, and was\r\nmuttering to himself.\r\n\r\nMarie ran forward, and, taking him by the arm, gave him a little\r\npush toward her guests. \"Frank, this is Mr. Linstrum.\"\r\n\r\nFrank took off his broad straw hat and nodded to Alexandra. When\r\nhe spoke to Carl, he showed a fine set of white teeth. He was burned\r\na dull red down to his neckband, and there was a heavy three-days'\r\nstubble on his face. Even in his agitation he was handsome, but\r\nhe looked a rash and violent man.\r\n\r\nBarely saluting the callers, he turned at once to his wife and\r\nbegan, in an outraged tone, \"I have to leave my team to drive the\r\nold woman Hiller's hogs out-a my wheat. I go to take dat old woman\r\nto de court if she ain't careful, I tell you!\"\r\n\r\nHis wife spoke soothingly. \"But, Frank, she has only her lame boy\r\nto help her. She does the best she can.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra looked at the excited man and offered a suggestion. \"Why\r\ndon't you go over there some afternoon and hog-tight her fences?\r\nYou'd save time for yourself in the end.\"\r\n\r\nFrank's neck stiffened. \"Not-a-much, I won't. I keep my hogs\r\nhome. Other peoples can do like me. See? If that Louis can mend\r\nshoes, he can mend fence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe,\" said Alexandra placidly; \"but I've found it sometimes pays\r\nto mend other people's fences. Good-bye, Marie. Come to see me\r\nsoon.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra walked firmly down the path and Carl followed her.\r\n\r\nFrank went into the house and threw himself on the sofa, his face\r\nto the wall, his clenched fist on his hip. Marie, having seen her\r\nguests off, came in and put her hand coaxingly on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Frank! You've run until you've made your head ache, now\r\nhaven't you? Let me make you some coffee.\"\r\n\r\n\"What else am I to do?\" he cried hotly in Bohemian. \"Am I to let\r\nany old woman's hogs root up my wheat? Is that what I work myself\r\nto death for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry about it, Frank. I'll speak to Mrs. Hiller again.\r\nBut, really, she almost cried last time they got out, she was so\r\nsorry.\"\r\n\r\nFrank bounced over on his other side. \"That's it; you always side\r\nwith them against me. They all know it. Anybody here feels free\r\nto borrow the mower and break it, or turn their hogs in on me.\r\nThey know you won't care!\"\r\n\r\nMarie hurried away to make his coffee. When she came back, he was\r\nfast asleep. She sat down and looked at him for a long while, very\r\nthoughtfully. When the kitchen clock struck six she went out to\r\nget supper, closing the door gently behind her. She was always\r\nsorry for Frank when he worked himself into one of these rages, and\r\nshe was sorry to have him rough and quarrelsome with his neighbors.\r\nShe was perfectly aware that the neighbors had a good deal to put\r\nup with, and that they bore with Frank for her sake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nMarie's father, Albert Tovesky, was one of the more intelligent\r\nBohemians who came West in the early seventies. He settled in Omaha\r\nand became a leader and adviser among his people there. Marie was\r\nhis youngest child, by a second wife, and was the apple of his eye.\r\nShe was barely sixteen, and was in the graduating class of the\r\nOmaha High School, when Frank Shabata arrived from the old country\r\nand set all the Bohemian girls in a flutter. He was easily the\r\nbuck of the beer-gardens, and on Sunday he was a sight to see, with\r\nhis silk hat and tucked shirt and blue frock-coat, wearing gloves\r\nand carrying a little wisp of a yellow cane. He was tall and fair,\r\nwith splendid teeth and close-cropped yellow curls, and he wore a\r\nslightly disdainful expression, proper for a young man with high\r\nconnections, whose mother had a big farm in the Elbe valley. There\r\nwas often an interesting discontent in his blue eyes, and every\r\nBohemian girl he met imagined herself the cause of that unsatisfied\r\nexpression. He had a way of drawing out his cambric handkerchief\r\nslowly, by one corner, from his breast-pocket, that was melancholy\r\nand romantic in the extreme. He took a little flight with each\r\nof the more eligible Bohemian girls, but it was when he was with\r\nlittle Marie Tovesky that he drew his handkerchief out most slowly,\r\nand, after he had lit a fresh cigar, dropped the match most\r\ndespairingly. Any one could see, with half an eye, that his proud\r\nheart was bleeding for somebody.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday, late in the summer after Marie's graduation, she met\r\nFrank at a Bohemian picnic down the river and went rowing with him\r\nall the afternoon. When she got home that evening she went straight\r\nto her father's room and told him that she was engaged to Shabata.\r\nOld Tovesky was having a comfortable pipe before he went to bed.\r\nWhen he heard his daughter's announcement, he first prudently\r\ncorked his beer bottle and then leaped to his feet and had a turn\r\nof temper. He characterized Frank Shabata by a Bohemian expression\r\nwhich is the equivalent of stuffed shirt.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't he go to work like the rest of us did? His farm in the\r\nElbe valley, indeed! Ain't he got plenty brothers and sisters?\r\nIt's his mother's farm, and why don't he stay at home and help her?\r\nHaven't I seen his mother out in the morning at five o'clock with\r\nher ladle and her big bucket on wheels, putting liquid manure on\r\nthe cabbages? Don't I know the look of old Eva Shabata's hands?\r\nLike an old horse's hoofs they are--and this fellow wearing gloves\r\nand rings! Engaged, indeed! You aren't fit to be out of school,\r\nand that's what's the matter with you. I will send you off to the\r\nSisters of the Sacred Heart in St. Louis, and they will teach you\r\nsome sense, _I_ guess!\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the very next week, Albert Tovesky took his daughter,\r\npale and tearful, down the river to the convent. But the way to\r\nmake Frank want anything was to tell him he couldn't have it. He\r\nmanaged to have an interview with Marie before she went away,\r\nand whereas he had been only half in love with her before, he now\r\npersuaded himself that he would not stop at anything. Marie took\r\nwith her to the convent, under the canvas lining of her trunk, the\r\nresults of a laborious and satisfying morning on Frank's part; no\r\nless than a dozen photographs of himself, taken in a dozen different\r\nlove-lorn attitudes. There was a little round photograph for her\r\nwatch-case, photographs for her wall and dresser, and even long\r\nnarrow ones to be used as bookmarks. More than once the handsome\r\ngentleman was torn to pieces before the French class by an indignant\r\nnun.\r\n\r\nMarie pined in the convent for a year, until her eighteenth birthday\r\nwas passed. Then she met Frank Shabata in the Union Station in\r\nSt. Louis and ran away with him. Old Tovesky forgave his daughter\r\nbecause there was nothing else to do, and bought her a farm in\r\nthe country that she had loved so well as a child. Since then her\r\nstory had been a part of the history of the Divide. She and Frank\r\nhad been living there for five years when Carl Linstrum came back\r\nto pay his long deferred visit to Alexandra. Frank had, on the\r\nwhole, done better than one might have expected. He had flung\r\nhimself at the soil with savage energy. Once a year he went to\r\nHastings or to Omaha, on a spree. He stayed away for a week or\r\ntwo, and then came home and worked like a demon. He did work; if\r\nhe felt sorry for himself, that was his own affair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the day of Alexandra's call at the Shabatas',\r\na heavy rain set in. Frank sat up until a late hour reading the\r\nSunday newspapers. One of the Goulds was getting a divorce, and\r\nFrank took it as a personal affront. In printing the story of the\r\nyoung man's marital troubles, the knowing editor gave a sufficiently\r\ncolored account of his career, stating the amount of his income\r\nand the manner in which he was supposed to spend it. Frank read\r\nEnglish slowly, and the more he read about this divorce case, the\r\nangrier he grew. At last he threw down the page with a snort. He\r\nturned to his farm-hand who was reading the other half of the paper.\r\n\r\n\"By God! if I have that young feller in de hayfield once, I show\r\nhim someting. Listen here what he do wit his money.\" And Frank\r\nbegan the catalogue of the young man's reputed extravagances.\r\n\r\nMarie sighed. She thought it hard that the Goulds, for whom she\r\nhad nothing but good will, should make her so much trouble. She\r\nhated to see the Sunday newspapers come into the house. Frank was\r\nalways reading about the doings of rich people and feeling outraged.\r\nHe had an inexhaustible stock of stories about their crimes and\r\nfollies, how they bribed the courts and shot down their butlers\r\nwith impunity whenever they chose. Frank and Lou Bergson had very\r\nsimilar ideas, and they were two of the political agitators of the\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nThe next morning broke clear and brilliant, but Frank said the\r\nground was too wet to plough, so he took the cart and drove over to\r\nSainte-Agnes to spend the day at Moses Marcel's saloon. After he\r\nwas gone, Marie went out to the back porch to begin her butter-making.\r\nA brisk wind had come up and was driving puffy white clouds across\r\nthe sky. The orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun. Marie\r\nstood looking toward it wistfully, her hand on the lid of the\r\nchurn, when she heard a sharp ring in the air, the merry sound of\r\nthe whetstone on the scythe. That invitation decided her. She ran\r\ninto the house, put on a short skirt and a pair of her husband's\r\nboots, caught up a tin pail and started for the orchard. Emil\r\nhad already begun work and was mowing vigorously. When he saw her\r\ncoming, he stopped and wiped his brow. His yellow canvas leggings\r\nand khaki trousers were splashed to the knees.\r\n\r\n\"Don't let me disturb you, Emil. I'm going to pick cherries.\r\nIsn't everything beautiful after the rain? Oh, but I'm glad to get\r\nthis place mowed! When I heard it raining in the night, I thought\r\nmaybe you would come and do it for me to-day. The wind wakened\r\nme. Didn't it blow dreadfully? Just smell the wild roses! They\r\nare always so spicy after a rain. We never had so many of them\r\nin here before. I suppose it's the wet season. Will you have to\r\ncut them, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I cut the grass, I will,\" Emil said teasingly. \"What's the\r\nmatter with you? What makes you so flighty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I flighty? I suppose that's the wet season, too, then. It's\r\nexciting to see everything growing so fast,--and to get the grass\r\ncut! Please leave the roses till last, if you must cut them. Oh,\r\nI don't mean all of them, I mean that low place down by my tree, where\r\nthere are so many. Aren't you splashed! Look at the spider-webs\r\nall over the grass. Good-bye. I'll call you if I see a snake.\"\r\n\r\nShe tripped away and Emil stood looking after her. In a few moments\r\nhe heard the cherries dropping smartly into the pail, and he began\r\nto swing his scythe with that long, even stroke that few American\r\nboys ever learn. Marie picked cherries and sang softly to herself,\r\nstripping one glittering branch after another, shivering when she\r\ncaught a shower of raindrops on her neck and hair. And Emil mowed\r\nhis way slowly down toward the cherry trees.\r\n\r\nThat summer the rains had been so many and opportune that it was\r\nalmost more than Shabata and his man could do to keep up with the\r\ncorn; the orchard was a neglected wilderness. All sorts of weeds and\r\nherbs and flowers had grown up there; splotches of wild larkspur,\r\npale green-and-white spikes of hoarhound, plantations of wild\r\ncotton, tangles of foxtail and wild wheat. South of the apricot\r\ntrees, cornering on the wheatfield, was Frank's alfalfa, where\r\nmyriads of white and yellow butterflies were always fluttering\r\nabove the purple blossoms. When Emil reached the lower corner by\r\nthe hedge, Marie was sitting under her white mulberry tree, the\r\npailful of cherries beside her, looking off at the gentle, tireless\r\nswelling of the wheat.\r\n\r\n\"Emil,\" she said suddenly--he was mowing quietly about under the\r\ntree so as not to disturb her--\"what religion did the Swedes have\r\naway back, before they were Christians?\"\r\n\r\nEmil paused and straightened his back. \"I don't know. About like\r\nthe Germans', wasn't it?\"\r\n\r\nMarie went on as if she had not heard him. \"The Bohemians, you\r\nknow, were tree worshipers before the missionaries came. Father says\r\nthe people in the mountains still do queer things, sometimes,--they\r\nbelieve that trees bring good or bad luck.\"\r\n\r\nEmil looked superior. \"Do they? Well, which are the lucky trees?\r\nI'd like to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know all of them, but I know lindens are. The old people\r\nin the mountains plant lindens to purify the forest, and to do away\r\nwith the spells that come from the old trees they say have lasted\r\nfrom heathen times. I'm a good Catholic, but I think I could get\r\nalong with caring for trees, if I hadn't anything else.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a poor saying,\" said Emil, stooping over to wipe his hands\r\nin the wet grass.\r\n\r\n\"Why is it? If I feel that way, I feel that way. I like trees\r\nbecause they seem more resigned to the way they have to live than\r\nother things do. I feel as if this tree knows everything I ever\r\nthink of when I sit here. When I come back to it, I never have to\r\nremind it of anything; I begin just where I left off.\"\r\n\r\nEmil had nothing to say to this. He reached up among the branches\r\nand began to pick the sweet, insipid fruit,--long ivory-colored\r\nberries, tipped with faint pink, like white coral, that fall to\r\nthe ground unheeded all summer through. He dropped a handful into\r\nher lap.\r\n\r\n\"Do you like Mr. Linstrum?\" Marie asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, ever so much; only he seems kind of staid and school-teachery.\r\nBut, of course, he is older than Frank, even. I'm sure I don't\r\nwant to live to be more than thirty, do you? Do you think Alexandra\r\nlikes him very much?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so. They were old friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Emil, you know what I mean!\" Marie tossed her head impatiently.\r\n\"Does she really care about him? When she used to tell me about\r\nhim, I always wondered whether she wasn't a little in love with\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who, Alexandra?\" Emil laughed and thrust his hands into his\r\ntrousers pockets. \"Alexandra's never been in love, you crazy!\" He\r\nlaughed again. \"She wouldn't know how to go about it. The idea!\"\r\n\r\nMarie shrugged her shoulders. \"Oh, you don't know Alexandra as well\r\nas you think you do! If you had any eyes, you would see that she\r\nis very fond of him. It would serve you all right if she walked\r\noff with Carl. I like him because he appreciates her more than\r\nyou do.\"\r\n\r\nEmil frowned. \"What are you talking about, Marie? Alexandra's\r\nall right. She and I have always been good friends. What more do\r\nyou want? I like to talk to Carl about New York and what a fellow\r\ncan do there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Emil! Surely you are not thinking of going off there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? I must go somewhere, mustn't I?\" The young man took up\r\nhis scythe and leaned on it. \"Would you rather I went off in the\r\nsand hills and lived like Ivar?\"\r\n\r\nMarie's face fell under his brooding gaze. She looked down at his\r\nwet leggings. \"I'm sure Alexandra hopes you will stay on here,\"\r\nshe murmured.\r\n\r\n\"Then Alexandra will be disappointed,\" the young man said roughly.\r\n\"What do I want to hang around here for? Alexandra can run the\r\nfarm all right, without me. I don't want to stand around and look\r\non. I want to be doing something on my own account.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" Marie sighed. \"There are so many, many things you\r\ncan do. Almost anything you choose.\"\r\n\r\n\"And there are so many, many things I can't do.\" Emil echoed her\r\ntone sarcastically. \"Sometimes I don't want to do anything at\r\nall, and sometimes I want to pull the four corners of the Divide\r\ntogether,\"--he threw out his arm and brought it back with a jerk,--\"so,\r\nlike a table-cloth. I get tired of seeing men and horses going up\r\nand down, up and down.\"\r\n\r\nMarie looked up at his defiant figure and her face clouded. \"I wish\r\nyou weren't so restless, and didn't get so worked up over things,\"\r\nshe said sadly.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" he returned shortly.\r\n\r\nShe sighed despondently. \"Everything I say makes you cross, don't\r\nit? And you never used to be cross to me.\"\r\n\r\nEmil took a step nearer and stood frowning down at her bent head.\r\nHe stood in an attitude of self-defense, his feet well apart, his\r\nhands clenched and drawn up at his sides, so that the cords stood\r\nout on his bare arms. \"I can't play with you like a little boy\r\nany more,\" he said slowly. \"That's what you miss, Marie. You'll\r\nhave to get some other little boy to play with.\" He stopped and took\r\na deep breath. Then he went on in a low tone, so intense that it\r\nwas almost threatening: \"Sometimes you seem to understand perfectly,\r\nand then sometimes you pretend you don't. You don't help things\r\nany by pretending. It's then that I want to pull the corners of\r\nthe Divide together. If you WON'T understand, you know, I could\r\nmake you!\"\r\n\r\nMarie clasped her hands and started up from her seat. She had grown\r\nvery pale and her eyes were shining with excitement and distress.\r\n\"But, Emil, if I understand, then all our good times are over, we\r\ncan never do nice things together any more. We shall have to behave\r\nlike Mr. Linstrum. And, anyhow, there's nothing to understand!\"\r\nShe struck the ground with her little foot fiercely. \"That won't\r\nlast. It will go away, and things will be just as they used to.\r\nI wish you were a Catholic. The Church helps people, indeed it\r\ndoes. I pray for you, but that's not the same as if you prayed\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke rapidly and pleadingly, looked entreatingly into his\r\nface. Emil stood defiant, gazing down at her.\r\n\r\n\"I can't pray to have the things I want,\" he said slowly, \"and I\r\nwon't pray not to have them, not if I'm damned for it.\"\r\n\r\nMarie turned away, wringing her hands. \"Oh, Emil, you won't try!\r\nThen all our good times are over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; over. I never expect to have any more.\"\r\n\r\nEmil gripped the hand-holds of his scythe and began to mow. Marie\r\ntook up her cherries and went slowly toward the house, crying\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nOn Sunday afternoon, a month after Carl Linstrum's arrival, he rode\r\nwith Emil up into the French country to attend a Catholic fair. He\r\nsat for most of the afternoon in the basement of the church, where\r\nthe fair was held, talking to Marie Shabata, or strolled about the\r\ngravel terrace, thrown up on the hillside in front of the basement\r\ndoors, where the French boys were jumping and wrestling and throwing\r\nthe discus. Some of the boys were in their white baseball suits;\r\nthey had just come up from a Sunday practice game down in the\r\nballgrounds. Amedee, the newly married, Emil's best friend, was\r\ntheir pitcher, renowned among the country towns for his dash and\r\nskill. Amedee was a little fellow, a year younger than Emil and\r\nmuch more boyish in appearance; very lithe and active and neatly\r\nmade, with a clear brown and white skin, and flashing white teeth.\r\nThe Sainte-Agnes boys were to play the Hastings nine in a fortnight,\r\nand Amedee's lightning balls were the hope of his team. The little\r\nFrenchman seemed to get every ounce there was in him behind the\r\nball as it left his hand.\r\n\r\n\"You'd have made the battery at the University for sure, 'Medee,\"\r\nEmil said as they were walking from the ball-grounds back to the\r\nchurch on the hill. \"You're pitching better than you did in the\r\nspring.\"\r\n\r\nAmedee grinned. \"Sure! A married man don't lose his head no more.\"\r\nHe slapped Emil on the back as he caught step with him. \"Oh, Emil,\r\nyou wanna get married right off quick! It's the greatest thing\r\never!\"\r\n\r\nEmil laughed. \"How am I going to get married without any girl?\"\r\n\r\nAmedee took his arm. \"Pooh! There are plenty girls will have\r\nyou. You wanna get some nice French girl, now. She treat you well;\r\nalways be jolly. See,\"--he began checking off on his fingers,--\"there\r\nis Severine, and Alphosen, and Josephine, and Hectorine, and Louise,\r\nand Malvina--why, I could love any of them girls! Why don't you\r\nget after them? Are you stuck up, Emil, or is anything the matter\r\nwith you? I never did know a boy twenty-two years old before that\r\ndidn't have no girl. You wanna be a priest, maybe? Not-a for me!\"\r\nAmedee swaggered. \"I bring many good Catholics into this world,\r\nI hope, and that's a way I help the Church.\"\r\n\r\nEmil looked down and patted him on the shoulder. \"Now you're windy,\r\n'Medee. You Frenchies like to brag.\"\r\n\r\nBut Amedee had the zeal of the newly married, and he was not\r\nto be lightly shaken off. \"Honest and true, Emil, don't you want\r\nANY girl? Maybe there's some young lady in Lincoln, now, very\r\ngrand,\"--Amedee waved his hand languidly before his face to denote\r\nthe fan of heartless beauty,--\"and you lost your heart up there.\r\nIs that it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe,\" said Emil.\r\n\r\nBut Amedee saw no appropriate glow in his friend's face. \"Bah!\"\r\nhe exclaimed in disgust. \"I tell all the French girls to keep 'way\r\nfrom you. You gotta rock in there,\" thumping Emil on the ribs.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the terrace at the side of the church, Amedee,\r\nwho was excited by his success on the ball-grounds, challenged\r\nEmil to a jumping-match, though he knew he would be beaten. They\r\nbelted themselves up, and Raoul Marcel, the choir tenor and Father\r\nDuchesne's pet, and Jean Bordelau, held the string over which they\r\nvaulted. All the French boys stood round, cheering and humping\r\nthemselves up when Emil or Amedee went over the wire, as if they\r\nwere helping in the lift. Emil stopped at five-feet-five, declaring\r\nthat he would spoil his appetite for supper if he jumped any more.\r\n\r\nAngelique, Amedee's pretty bride, as blonde and fair as her name,\r\nwho had come out to watch the match, tossed her head at Emil and\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"'Medee could jump much higher than you if he were as tall. And\r\nanyhow, he is much more graceful. He goes over like a bird, and\r\nyou have to hump yourself all up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I do, do I?\" Emil caught her and kissed her saucy mouth squarely,\r\nwhile she laughed and struggled and called, \"'Medee! 'Medee!\"\r\n\r\n\"There, you see your 'Medee isn't even big enough to get you away\r\nfrom me. I could run away with you right now and he could only\r\nsit down and cry about it. I'll show you whether I have to hump\r\nmyself!\" Laughing and panting, he picked Angelique up in his arms\r\nand began running about the rectangle with her. Not until he saw\r\nMarie Shabata's tiger eyes flashing from the gloom of the basement\r\ndoorway did he hand the disheveled bride over to her husband.\r\n\"There, go to your graceful; I haven't the heart to take you away\r\nfrom him.\"\r\n\r\nAngelique clung to her husband and made faces at Emil over the\r\nwhite shoulder of Amedee's ball-shirt. Emil was greatly amused at\r\nher air of proprietorship and at Amedee's shameless submission to\r\nit. He was delighted with his friend's good fortune. He liked to\r\nsee and to think about Amedee's sunny, natural, happy love.\r\n\r\nHe and Amedee had ridden and wrestled and larked together since\r\nthey were lads of twelve. On Sundays and holidays they were always\r\narm in arm. It seemed strange that now he should have to hide the\r\nthing that Amedee was so proud of, that the feeling which gave one\r\nof them such happiness should bring the other such despair. It\r\nwas like that when Alexandra tested her seed-corn in the spring,\r\nhe mused. From two ears that had grown side by side, the grains\r\nof one shot up joyfully into the light, projecting themselves into\r\nthe future, and the grains from the other lay still in the earth\r\nand rotted; and nobody knew why.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nWhile Emil and Carl were amusing themselves at the fair, Alexandra\r\nwas at home, busy with her account-books, which had been neglected\r\nof late. She was almost through with her figures when she heard\r\na cart drive up to the gate, and looking out of the window she saw\r\nher two older brothers. They had seemed to avoid her ever since\r\nCarl Linstrum's arrival, four weeks ago that day, and she hurried\r\nto the door to welcome them. She saw at once that they had come\r\nwith some very definite purpose. They followed her stiffly into\r\nthe sitting-room. Oscar sat down, but Lou walked over to the window\r\nand remained standing, his hands behind him.\r\n\r\n\"You are by yourself?\" he asked, looking toward the doorway into\r\nthe parlor.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Carl and Emil went up to the Catholic fair.\"\r\n\r\nFor a few moments neither of the men spoke.\r\n\r\nThen Lou came out sharply. \"How soon does he intend to go away\r\nfrom here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, Lou. Not for some time, I hope.\" Alexandra spoke\r\nin an even, quiet tone that often exasperated her brothers. They\r\nfelt that she was trying to be superior with them.\r\n\r\nOscar spoke up grimly. \"We thought we ought to tell you that people\r\nhave begun to talk,\" he said meaningly.\r\n\r\nAlexandra looked at him. \"What about?\"\r\n\r\nOscar met her eyes blankly. \"About you, keeping him here so long.\r\nIt looks bad for him to be hanging on to a woman this way. People\r\nthink you're getting taken in.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra shut her account-book firmly. \"Boys,\" she said seriously,\r\n\"don't let's go on with this. We won't come out anywhere. I can't\r\ntake advice on such a matter. I know you mean well, but you must\r\nnot feel responsible for me in things of this sort. If we go on\r\nwith this talk it will only make hard feeling.\"\r\n\r\nLou whipped about from the window. \"You ought to think a little\r\nabout your family. You're making us all ridiculous.\"\r\n\r\n\"How am I?\"\r\n\r\n\"People are beginning to say you want to marry the fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, and what is ridiculous about that?\"\r\n\r\nLou and Oscar exchanged outraged looks. \"Alexandra! Can't you\r\nsee he's just a tramp and he's after your money? He wants to be\r\ntaken care of, he does!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, suppose I want to take care of him? Whose business is it\r\nbut my own?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you know he'd get hold of your property?\"\r\n\r\n\"He'd get hold of what I wished to give him, certainly.\"\r\n\r\nOscar sat up suddenly and Lou clutched at his bristly hair.\r\n\r\n\"Give him?\" Lou shouted. \"Our property, our homestead?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know about the homestead,\" said Alexandra quietly. \"I\r\nknow you and Oscar have always expected that it would be left to\r\nyour children, and I'm not sure but what you're right. But I'll\r\ndo exactly as I please with the rest of my land, boys.\"\r\n\r\n\"The rest of your land!\" cried Lou, growing more excited every\r\nminute. \"Didn't all the land come out of the homestead? It was\r\nbought with money borrowed on the homestead, and Oscar and me worked\r\nourselves to the bone paying interest on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you paid the interest. But when you married we made a division\r\nof the land, and you were satisfied. I've made more on my farms\r\nsince I've been alone than when we all worked together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything you've made has come out of the original land that us\r\nboys worked for, hasn't it? The farms and all that comes out of\r\nthem belongs to us as a family.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra waved her hand impatiently. \"Come now, Lou. Stick to\r\nthe facts. You are talking nonsense. Go to the county clerk and\r\nask him who owns my land, and whether my titles are good.\"\r\n\r\nLou turned to his brother. \"This is what comes of letting a woman\r\nmeddle in business,\" he said bitterly. \"We ought to have taken\r\nthings in our own hands years ago. But she liked to run things,\r\nand we humored her. We thought you had good sense, Alexandra. We\r\nnever thought you'd do anything foolish.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra rapped impatiently on her desk with her knuckles.\r\n\"Listen, Lou. Don't talk wild. You say you ought to have taken\r\nthings into your own hands years ago. I suppose you mean before\r\nyou left home. But how could you take hold of what wasn't there?\r\nI've got most of what I have now since we divided the property;\r\nI've built it up myself, and it has nothing to do with you.\"\r\n\r\nOscar spoke up solemnly. \"The property of a family really belongs\r\nto the men of the family, no matter about the title. If anything\r\ngoes wrong, it's the men that are held responsible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course,\" Lou broke in. \"Everybody knows that. Oscar and\r\nme have always been easy-going and we've never made any fuss. We\r\nwere willing you should hold the land and have the good of it, but\r\nyou got no right to part with any of it. We worked in the fields\r\nto pay for the first land you bought, and whatever's come out of\r\nit has got to be kept in the family.\"\r\n\r\nOscar reinforced his brother, his mind fixed on the one point he\r\ncould see. \"The property of a family belongs to the men of the\r\nfamily, because they are held responsible, and because they do the\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra looked from one to the other, her eyes full of indignation.\r\nShe had been impatient before, but now she was beginning to feel\r\nangry. \"And what about my work?\" she asked in an unsteady voice.\r\n\r\nLou looked at the carpet. \"Oh, now, Alexandra, you always took\r\nit pretty easy! Of course we wanted you to. You liked to manage\r\nround, and we always humored you. We realize you were a great\r\ndeal of help to us. There's no woman anywhere around that knows\r\nas much about business as you do, and we've always been proud of\r\nthat, and thought you were pretty smart. But, of course, the real\r\nwork always fell on us. Good advice is all right, but it don't\r\nget the weeds out of the corn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe not, but it sometimes puts in the crop, and it sometimes\r\nkeeps the fields for corn to grow in,\" said Alexandra dryly. \"Why,\r\nLou, I can remember when you and Oscar wanted to sell this homestead\r\nand all the improvements to old preacher Ericson for two thousand\r\ndollars. If I'd consented, you'd have gone down to the river and\r\nscraped along on poor farms for the rest of your lives. When I put\r\nin our first field of alfalfa you both opposed me, just because I\r\nfirst heard about it from a young man who had been to the University.\r\nYou said I was being taken in then, and all the neighbors said\r\nso. You know as well as I do that alfalfa has been the salvation\r\nof this country. You all laughed at me when I said our land here\r\nwas about ready for wheat, and I had to raise three big wheat crops\r\nbefore the neighbors quit putting all their land in corn. Why, I\r\nremember you cried, Lou, when we put in the first big wheat-planting,\r\nand said everybody was laughing at us.\"\r\n\r\nLou turned to Oscar. \"That's the woman of it; if she tells you to\r\nput in a crop, she thinks she's put it in. It makes women conceited\r\nto meddle in business. I shouldn't think you'd want to remind us\r\nhow hard you were on us, Alexandra, after the way you baby Emil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hard on you? I never meant to be hard. Conditions were hard.\r\nMaybe I would never have been very soft, anyhow; but I certainly\r\ndidn't choose to be the kind of girl I was. If you take even a\r\nvine and cut it back again and again, it grows hard, like a tree.\"\r\n\r\nLou felt that they were wandering from the point, and that\r\nin digression Alexandra might unnerve him. He wiped his forehead\r\nwith a jerk of his handkerchief. \"We never doubted you, Alexandra.\r\nWe never questioned anything you did. You've always had your own\r\nway. But you can't expect us to sit like stumps and see you done\r\nout of the property by any loafer who happens along, and making\r\nyourself ridiculous into the bargain.\"\r\n\r\nOscar rose. \"Yes,\" he broke in, \"everybody's laughing to see you\r\nget took in; at your age, too. Everybody knows he's nearly five\r\nyears younger than you, and is after your money. Why, Alexandra,\r\nyou are forty years old!\"\r\n\r\n\"All that doesn't concern anybody but Carl and me. Go to town and\r\nask your lawyers what you can do to restrain me from disposing of\r\nmy own property. And I advise you to do what they tell you; for\r\nthe authority you can exert by law is the only influence you will\r\never have over me again.\" Alexandra rose. \"I think I would rather\r\nnot have lived to find out what I have to-day,\" she said quietly,\r\nclosing her desk.\r\n\r\nLou and Oscar looked at each other questioningly. There seemed to\r\nbe nothing to do but to go, and they walked out.\r\n\r\n\"You can't do business with women,\" Oscar said heavily as he\r\nclambered into the cart. \"But anyhow, we've had our say, at last.\"\r\n\r\nLou scratched his head. \"Talk of that kind might come too high, you\r\nknow; but she's apt to be sensible. You hadn't ought to said that\r\nabout her age, though, Oscar. I'm afraid that hurt her feelings;\r\nand the worst thing we can do is to make her sore at us. She'd\r\nmarry him out of contrariness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I only meant,\" said Oscar, \"that she is old enough to know better,\r\nand she is. If she was going to marry, she ought to done it long\r\nago, and not go making a fool of herself now.\"\r\n\r\nLou looked anxious, nevertheless. \"Of course,\" he reflected hopefully\r\nand inconsistently, \"Alexandra ain't much like other women-folks.\r\nMaybe it won't make her sore. Maybe she'd as soon be forty as\r\nnot!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nEmil came home at about half-past seven o'clock that evening. Old\r\nIvar met him at the windmill and took his horse, and the young\r\nman went directly into the house. He called to his sister and she\r\nanswered from her bedroom, behind the sitting-room, saying that\r\nshe was lying down.\r\n\r\nEmil went to her door.\r\n\r\n\"Can I see you for a minute?\" he asked. \"I want to talk to you\r\nabout something before Carl comes.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra rose quickly and came to the door. \"Where is Carl?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lou and Oscar met us and said they wanted to talk to him, so he\r\nrode over to Oscar's with them. Are you coming out?\" Emil asked\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sit down. I'll be dressed in a moment.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra closed her door, and Emil sank down on the old slat lounge\r\nand sat with his head in his hands. When his sister came out, he\r\nlooked up, not knowing whether the interval had been short or long,\r\nand he was surprised to see that the room had grown quite dark.\r\nThat was just as well; it would be easier to talk if he were not\r\nunder the gaze of those clear, deliberate eyes, that saw so far in\r\nsome directions and were so blind in others. Alexandra, too, was\r\nglad of the dusk. Her face was swollen from crying.\r\n\r\nEmil started up and then sat down again. \"Alexandra,\" he said\r\nslowly, in his deep young baritone, \"I don't want to go away to\r\nlaw school this fall. Let me put it off another year. I want to\r\ntake a year off and look around. It's awfully easy to rush into\r\na profession you don't really like, and awfully hard to get out of\r\nit. Linstrum and I have been talking about that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Emil. Only don't go off looking for land.\" She came\r\nup and put her hand on his shoulder. \"I've been wishing you could\r\nstay with me this winter.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I don't want to do, Alexandra. I'm restless.\r\nI want to go to a new place. I want to go down to the City of\r\nMexico to join one of the University fellows who's at the head of\r\nan electrical plant. He wrote me he could give me a little job,\r\nenough to pay my way, and I could look around and see what I want\r\nto do. I want to go as soon as harvest is over. I guess Lou and\r\nOscar will be sore about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose they will.\" Alexandra sat down on the lounge beside\r\nhim. \"They are very angry with me, Emil. We have had a quarrel.\r\nThey will not come here again.\"\r\n\r\nEmil scarcely heard what she was saying; he did not notice the\r\nsadness of her tone. He was thinking about the reckless life he\r\nmeant to live in Mexico.\r\n\r\n\"What about?\" he asked absently.\r\n\r\n\"About Carl Linstrum. They are afraid I am going to marry him,\r\nand that some of my property will get away from them.\"\r\n\r\nEmil shrugged his shoulders. \"What nonsense!\" he murmured. \"Just\r\nlike them.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra drew back. \"Why nonsense, Emil?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you've never thought of such a thing, have you? They always\r\nhave to have something to fuss about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Emil,\" said his sister slowly, \"you ought not to take things for\r\ngranted. Do you agree with them that I have no right to change my\r\nway of living?\"\r\n\r\nEmil looked at the outline of his sister's head in the dim light.\r\nThey were sitting close together and he somehow felt that she\r\ncould hear his thoughts. He was silent for a moment, and then said\r\nin an embarrassed tone, \"Why, no, certainly not. You ought to do\r\nwhatever you want to. I'll always back you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it would seem a little bit ridiculous to you if I married\r\nCarl?\"\r\n\r\nEmil fidgeted. The issue seemed to him too far-fetched to warrant\r\ndiscussion. \"Why, no. I should be surprised if you wanted to. I\r\ncan't see exactly why. But that's none of my business. You ought\r\nto do as you please. Certainly you ought not to pay any attention\r\nto what the boys say.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra sighed. \"I had hoped you might understand, a little,\r\nwhy I do want to. But I suppose that's too much to expect. I've\r\nhad a pretty lonely life, Emil. Besides Marie, Carl is the only\r\nfriend I have ever had.\"\r\n\r\nEmil was awake now; a name in her last sentence roused him. He\r\nput out his hand and took his sister's awkwardly. \"You ought to\r\ndo just as you wish, and I think Carl's a fine fellow. He and I\r\nwould always get on. I don't believe any of the things the boys\r\nsay about him, honest I don't. They are suspicious of him because\r\nhe's intelligent. You know their way. They've been sore at me\r\never since you let me go away to college. They're always trying to\r\ncatch me up. If I were you, I wouldn't pay any attention to them.\r\nThere's nothing to get upset about. Carl's a sensible fellow. He\r\nwon't mind them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. If they talk to him the way they did to me, I think\r\nhe'll go away.\"\r\n\r\nEmil grew more and more uneasy. \"Think so? Well, Marie said it\r\nwould serve us all right if you walked off with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she? Bless her little heart! SHE would.\" Alexandra's voice\r\nbroke.\r\n\r\nEmil began unlacing his leggings. \"Why don't you talk to her about\r\nit? There's Carl, I hear his horse. I guess I'll go upstairs and\r\nget my boots off. No, I don't want any supper. We had supper at\r\nfive o'clock, at the fair.\"\r\n\r\nEmil was glad to escape and get to his own room. He was a little\r\nashamed for his sister, though he had tried not to show it. He\r\nfelt that there was something indecorous in her proposal, and she\r\ndid seem to him somewhat ridiculous. There was trouble enough in\r\nthe world, he reflected, as he threw himself upon his bed, without\r\npeople who were forty years old imagining they wanted to get\r\nmarried. In the darkness and silence Emil was not likely to think\r\nlong about Alexandra. Every image slipped away but one. He had\r\nseen Marie in the crowd that afternoon. She sold candy at the\r\nfair. WHY had she ever run away with Frank Shabata, and how could\r\nshe go on laughing and working and taking an interest in things?\r\nWhy did she like so many people, and why had she seemed pleased when\r\nall the French and Bohemian boys, and the priest himself, crowded\r\nround her candy stand? Why did she care about any one but him? Why\r\ncould he never, never find the thing he looked for in her playful,\r\naffectionate eyes?\r\n\r\nThen he fell to imagining that he looked once more and found it\r\nthere, and what it would be like if she loved him,--she who, as\r\nAlexandra said, could give her whole heart. In that dream he could\r\nlie for hours, as if in a trance. His spirit went out of his body\r\nand crossed the fields to Marie Shabata.\r\n\r\nAt the University dances the girls had often looked wonderingly\r\nat the tall young Swede with the fine head, leaning against the\r\nwall and frowning, his arms folded, his eyes fixed on the ceiling\r\nor the floor. All the girls were a little afraid of him. He was\r\ndistinguished-looking, and not the jollying kind. They felt that\r\nhe was too intense and preoccupied. There was something queer about\r\nhim. Emil's fraternity rather prided itself upon its dances, and\r\nsometimes he did his duty and danced every dance. But whether he\r\nwas on the floor or brooding in a corner, he was always thinking\r\nabout Marie Shabata. For two years the storm had been gathering\r\nin him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nCarl came into the sitting-room while Alexandra was lighting the\r\nlamp. She looked up at him as she adjusted the shade. His sharp\r\nshoulders stooped as if he were very tired, his face was pale,\r\nand there were bluish shadows under his dark eyes. His anger had\r\nburned itself out and left him sick and disgusted.\r\n\r\n\"You have seen Lou and Oscar?\" Alexandra asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\" His eyes avoided hers.\r\n\r\nAlexandra took a deep breath. \"And now you are going away. I\r\nthought so.\"\r\n\r\nCarl threw himself into a chair and pushed the dark lock back\r\nfrom his forehead with his white, nervous hand. \"What a hopeless\r\nposition you are in, Alexandra!\" he exclaimed feverishly. \"It is\r\nyour fate to be always surrounded by little men. And I am no better\r\nthan the rest. I am too little to face the criticism of even such\r\nmen as Lou and Oscar. Yes, I am going away; to-morrow. I cannot\r\neven ask you to give me a promise until I have something to offer\r\nyou. I thought, perhaps, I could do that; but I find I can't.\"\r\n\r\n\"What good comes of offering people things they don't need?\"\r\nAlexandra asked sadly. \"I don't need money. But I have needed\r\nyou for a great many years. I wonder why I have been permitted to\r\nprosper, if it is only to take my friends away from me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't deceive myself,\" Carl said frankly. \"I know that I am\r\ngoing away on my own account. I must make the usual effort. I\r\nmust have something to show for myself. To take what you would\r\ngive me, I should have to be either a very large man or a very\r\nsmall one, and I am only in the middle class.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra sighed. \"I have a feeling that if you go away, you will\r\nnot come back. Something will happen to one of us, or to both.\r\nPeople have to snatch at happiness when they can, in this world.\r\nIt is always easier to lose than to find. What I have is yours,\r\nif you care enough about me to take it.\"\r\n\r\nCarl rose and looked up at the picture of John Bergson. \"But I\r\ncan't, my dear, I can't! I will go North at once. Instead of idling\r\nabout in California all winter, I shall be getting my bearings up\r\nthere. I won't waste another week. Be patient with me, Alexandra.\r\nGive me a year!\"\r\n\r\n\"As you will,\" said Alexandra wearily. \"All at once, in a single\r\nday, I lose everything; and I do not know why. Emil, too, is going\r\naway.\" Carl was still studying John Bergson's face and Alexandra's\r\neyes followed his. \"Yes,\" she said, \"if he could have seen all\r\nthat would come of the task he gave me, he would have been sorry.\r\nI hope he does not see me now. I hope that he is among the old\r\npeople of his blood and country, and that tidings do not reach him\r\nfrom the New World.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III. Winter Memories\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nWinter has settled down over the Divide again; the season in\r\nwhich Nature recuperates, in which she sinks to sleep between the\r\nfruitfulness of autumn and the passion of spring. The birds have\r\ngone. The teeming life that goes on down in the long grass is\r\nexterminated. The prairie-dog keeps his hole. The rabbits run\r\nshivering from one frozen garden patch to another and are hard put\r\nto it to find frost-bitten cabbage-stalks. At night the coyotes\r\nroam the wintry waste, howling for food. The variegated fields\r\nare all one color now; the pastures, the stubble, the roads, the\r\nsky are the same leaden gray. The hedgerows and trees are scarcely\r\nperceptible against the bare earth, whose slaty hue they have taken\r\non. The ground is frozen so hard that it bruises the foot to walk\r\nin the roads or in the ploughed fields. It is like an iron country,\r\nand the spirit is oppressed by its rigor and melancholy. One could\r\neasily believe that in that dead landscape the germs of life and\r\nfruitfulness were extinct forever.\r\n\r\nAlexandra has settled back into her old routine. There are weekly\r\nletters from Emil. Lou and Oscar she has not seen since Carl\r\nwent away. To avoid awkward encounters in the presence of curious\r\nspectators, she has stopped going to the Norwegian Church and drives\r\nup to the Reform Church at Hanover, or goes with Marie Shabata to\r\nthe Catholic Church, locally known as \"the French Church.\" She has\r\nnot told Marie about Carl, or her differences with her brothers.\r\nShe was never very communicative about her own affairs, and when\r\nshe came to the point, an instinct told her that about such things\r\nshe and Marie would not understand one another.\r\n\r\nOld Mrs. Lee had been afraid that family misunderstandings might\r\ndeprive her of her yearly visit to Alexandra. But on the first day\r\nof December Alexandra telephoned Annie that to-morrow she would\r\nsend Ivar over for her mother, and the next day the old lady arrived\r\nwith her bundles. For twelve years Mrs. Lee had always entered\r\nAlexandra's sitting-room with the same exclamation, \"Now we be yust-a\r\nlike old times!\" She enjoyed the liberty Alexandra gave her, and\r\nhearing her own language about her all day long. Here she could\r\nwear her nightcap and sleep with all her windows shut, listen\r\nto Ivar reading the Bible, and here she could run about among the\r\nstables in a pair of Emil's old boots. Though she was bent almost\r\ndouble, she was as spry as a gopher. Her face was as brown as if\r\nit had been varnished, and as full of wrinkles as a washerwoman's\r\nhands. She had three jolly old teeth left in the front of her\r\nmouth, and when she grinned she looked very knowing, as if when\r\nyou found out how to take it, life wasn't half bad. While she and\r\nAlexandra patched and pieced and quilted, she talked incessantly\r\nabout stories she read in a Swedish family paper, telling the plots\r\nin great detail; or about her life on a dairy farm in Gottland\r\nwhen she was a girl. Sometimes she forgot which were the printed\r\nstories and which were the real stories, it all seemed so far away.\r\nShe loved to take a little brandy, with hot water and sugar, before\r\nshe went to bed, and Alexandra always had it ready for her. \"It\r\nsends good dreams,\" she would say with a twinkle in her eye.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Lee had been with Alexandra for a week, Marie Shabata\r\ntelephoned one morning to say that Frank had gone to town for the\r\nday, and she would like them to come over for coffee in the afternoon.\r\nMrs. Lee hurried to wash out and iron her new cross-stitched apron,\r\nwhich she had finished only the night before; a checked gingham\r\napron worked with a design ten inches broad across the bottom;\r\na hunting scene, with fir trees and a stag and dogs and huntsmen.\r\nMrs. Lee was firm with herself at dinner, and refused a second\r\nhelping of apple dumplings. \"I ta-ank I save up,\" she said with\r\na giggle.\r\n\r\nAt two o'clock in the afternoon Alexandra's cart drove up to the\r\nShabatas' gate, and Marie saw Mrs. Lee's red shawl come bobbing up\r\nthe path. She ran to the door and pulled the old woman into the\r\nhouse with a hug, helping her to take off her wraps while Alexandra\r\nblanketed the horse outside. Mrs. Lee had put on her best black\r\nsatine dress--she abominated woolen stuffs, even in winter--and\r\na crocheted collar, fastened with a big pale gold pin, containing\r\nfaded daguerreotypes of her father and mother. She had not worn\r\nher apron for fear of rumpling it, and now she shook it out and\r\ntied it round her waist with a conscious air. Marie drew back and\r\nthrew up her hands, exclaiming, \"Oh, what a beauty! I've never\r\nseen this one before, have I, Mrs. Lee?\"\r\n\r\nThe old woman giggled and ducked her head. \"No, yust las' night I\r\nma-ake. See dis tread; verra strong, no wa-ash out, no fade. My\r\nsister send from Sveden. I yust-a ta-ank you like dis.\"\r\n\r\nMarie ran to the door again. \"Come in, Alexandra. I have been\r\nlooking at Mrs. Lee's apron. Do stop on your way home and show it\r\nto Mrs. Hiller. She's crazy about cross-stitch.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Alexandra removed her hat and veil, Mrs. Lee went out to the\r\nkitchen and settled herself in a wooden rocking-chair by the stove,\r\nlooking with great interest at the table, set for three, with a white\r\ncloth, and a pot of pink geraniums in the middle. \"My, a-an't you\r\ngotta fine plants; such-a much flower. How you keep from freeze?\"\r\n\r\nShe pointed to the window-shelves, full of blooming fuchsias and\r\ngeraniums.\r\n\r\n\"I keep the fire all night, Mrs. Lee, and when it's very cold I put\r\nthem all on the table, in the middle of the room. Other nights I\r\nonly put newspapers behind them. Frank laughs at me for fussing,\r\nbut when they don't bloom he says, 'What's the matter with the\r\ndarned things?'--What do you hear from Carl, Alexandra?\"\r\n\r\n\"He got to Dawson before the river froze, and now I suppose I won't\r\nhear any more until spring. Before he left California he sent me\r\na box of orange flowers, but they didn't keep very well. I have\r\nbrought a bunch of Emil's letters for you.\" Alexandra came out\r\nfrom the sitting-room and pinched Marie's cheek playfully. \"You\r\ndon't look as if the weather ever froze you up. Never have colds,\r\ndo you? That's a good girl. She had dark red cheeks like this\r\nwhen she was a little girl, Mrs. Lee. She looked like some queer\r\nforeign kind of a doll. I've never forgot the first time I saw\r\nyou in Mieklejohn's store, Marie, the time father was lying sick.\r\nCarl and I were talking about that before he went away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember, and Emil had his kitten along. When are you going to\r\nsend Emil's Christmas box?\"\r\n\r\n\"It ought to have gone before this. I'll have to send it by mail\r\nnow, to get it there in time.\"\r\n\r\nMarie pulled a dark purple silk necktie from her workbasket. \"I\r\nknit this for him. It's a good color, don't you think? Will you\r\nplease put it in with your things and tell him it's from me, to\r\nwear when he goes serenading.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra laughed. \"I don't believe he goes serenading much. He\r\nsays in one letter that the Mexican ladies are said to be very\r\nbeautiful, but that don't seem to me very warm praise.\"\r\n\r\nMarie tossed her head. \"Emil can't fool me. If he's bought a\r\nguitar, he goes serenading. Who wouldn't, with all those Spanish\r\ngirls dropping flowers down from their windows! I'd sing to them\r\nevery night, wouldn't you, Mrs. Lee?\"\r\n\r\nThe old lady chuckled. Her eyes lit up as Marie bent down and\r\nopened the oven door. A delicious hot fragrance blew out into the\r\ntidy kitchen. \"My, somet'ing smell good!\" She turned to Alexandra\r\nwith a wink, her three yellow teeth making a brave show, \"I ta-ank\r\ndat stop my yaw from ache no more!\" she said contentedly.\r\n\r\nMarie took out a pan of delicate little rolls, stuffed with stewed\r\napricots, and began to dust them over with powdered sugar. \"I hope\r\nyou'll like these, Mrs. Lee; Alexandra does. The Bohemians always\r\nlike them with their coffee. But if you don't, I have a coffee-cake\r\nwith nuts and poppy seeds. Alexandra, will you get the cream jug?\r\nI put it in the window to keep cool.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Bohemians,\" said Alexandra, as they drew up to the table,\r\n\"certainly know how to make more kinds of bread than any other\r\npeople in the world. Old Mrs. Hiller told me once at the church\r\nsupper that she could make seven kinds of fancy bread, but Marie\r\ncould make a dozen.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lee held up one of the apricot rolls between her brown thumb\r\nand forefinger and weighed it critically. \"Yust like-a fedders,\"\r\nshe pronounced with satisfaction. \"My, a-an't dis nice!\" she\r\nexclaimed as she stirred her coffee. \"I yust ta-ake a liddle yelly\r\nnow, too, I ta-ank.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra and Marie laughed at her forehandedness, and fell to\r\ntalking of their own affairs. \"I was afraid you had a cold when\r\nI talked to you over the telephone the other night, Marie. What\r\nwas the matter, had you been crying?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe I had,\" Marie smiled guiltily. \"Frank was out late that\r\nnight. Don't you get lonely sometimes in the winter, when everybody\r\nhas gone away?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought it was something like that. If I hadn't had company,\r\nI'd have run over to see for myself. If you get down-hearted, what\r\nwill become of the rest of us?\" Alexandra asked.\r\n\r\n\"I don't, very often. There's Mrs. Lee without any coffee!\"\r\n\r\nLater, when Mrs. Lee declared that her powers were spent, Marie\r\nand Alexandra went upstairs to look for some crochet patterns the\r\nold lady wanted to borrow. \"Better put on your coat, Alexandra.\r\nIt's cold up there, and I have no idea where those patterns are. I\r\nmay have to look through my old trunks.\" Marie caught up a shawl\r\nand opened the stair door, running up the steps ahead of her guest.\r\n\"While I go through the bureau drawers, you might look in those\r\nhat-boxes on the closet-shelf, over where Frank's clothes hang.\r\nThere are a lot of odds and ends in them.\"\r\n\r\nShe began tossing over the contents of the drawers, and Alexandra\r\nwent into the clothes-closet. Presently she came back, holding a\r\nslender elastic yellow stick in her hand.\r\n\r\n\"What in the world is this, Marie? You don't mean to tell me Frank\r\never carried such a thing?\"\r\n\r\nMarie blinked at it with astonishment and sat down on the floor.\r\n\"Where did you find it? I didn't know he had kept it. I haven't\r\nseen it for years.\"\r\n\r\n\"It really is a cane, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. One he brought from the old country. He used to carry it\r\nwhen I first knew him. Isn't it foolish? Poor Frank!\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra twirled the stick in her fingers and laughed. \"He must\r\nhave looked funny!\"\r\n\r\nMarie was thoughtful. \"No, he didn't, really. It didn't seem out\r\nof place. He used to be awfully gay like that when he was a young\r\nman. I guess people always get what's hardest for them, Alexandra.\"\r\nMarie gathered the shawl closer about her and still looked hard at\r\nthe cane. \"Frank would be all right in the right place,\" she said\r\nreflectively. \"He ought to have a different kind of wife, for one\r\nthing. Do you know, Alexandra, I could pick out exactly the right\r\nsort of woman for Frank--now. The trouble is you almost have\r\nto marry a man before you can find out the sort of wife he needs;\r\nand usually it's exactly the sort you are not. Then what are you\r\ngoing to do about it?\" she asked candidly.\r\n\r\nAlexandra confessed she didn't know. \"However,\" she added, \"it\r\nseems to me that you get along with Frank about as well as any\r\nwoman I've ever seen or heard of could.\"\r\n\r\nMarie shook her head, pursing her lips and blowing her warm breath\r\nsoftly out into the frosty air. \"No; I was spoiled at home. I\r\nlike my own way, and I have a quick tongue. When Frank brags, I\r\nsay sharp things, and he never forgets. He goes over and over it\r\nin his mind; I can feel him. Then I'm too giddy. Frank's wife\r\nought to be timid, and she ought not to care about another living\r\nthing in the world but just Frank! I didn't, when I married him,\r\nbut I suppose I was too young to stay like that.\" Marie sighed.\r\n\r\nAlexandra had never heard Marie speak so frankly about her husband\r\nbefore, and she felt that it was wiser not to encourage her. No\r\ngood, she reasoned, ever came from talking about such things, and\r\nwhile Marie was thinking aloud, Alexandra had been steadily searching\r\nthe hat-boxes. \"Aren't these the patterns, Maria?\"\r\n\r\nMaria sprang up from the floor. \"Sure enough, we were looking\r\nfor patterns, weren't we? I'd forgot about everything but Frank's\r\nother wife. I'll put that away.\"\r\n\r\nShe poked the cane behind Frank's Sunday clothes, and though she\r\nlaughed, Alexandra saw there were tears in her eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen they went back to the kitchen, the snow had begun to fall,\r\nand Marie's visitors thought they must be getting home. She went\r\nout to the cart with them, and tucked the robes about old Mrs.\r\nLee while Alexandra took the blanket off her horse. As they drove\r\naway, Marie turned and went slowly back to the house. She took up\r\nthe package of letters Alexandra had brought, but she did not read\r\nthem. She turned them over and looked at the foreign stamps, and\r\nthen sat watching the flying snow while the dusk deepened in the\r\nkitchen and the stove sent out a red glow.\r\n\r\nMarie knew perfectly well that Emil's letters were written more for\r\nher than for Alexandra. They were not the sort of letters that a\r\nyoung man writes to his sister. They were both more personal and\r\nmore painstaking; full of descriptions of the gay life in the old\r\nMexican capital in the days when the strong hand of Porfirio Diaz\r\nwas still strong. He told about bull-fights and cock-fights,\r\nchurches and FIESTAS, the flower-markets and the fountains, the\r\nmusic and dancing, the people of all nations he met in the Italian\r\nrestaurants on San Francisco Street. In short, they were the kind\r\nof letters a young man writes to a woman when he wishes himself\r\nand his life to seem interesting to her, when he wishes to enlist\r\nher imagination in his behalf.\r\n\r\nMarie, when she was alone or when she sat sewing in the evening,\r\noften thought about what it must be like down there where Emil was;\r\nwhere there were flowers and street bands everywhere, and carriages\r\nrattling up and down, and where there was a little blind boot-black\r\nin front of the cathedral who could play any tune you asked for\r\nby dropping the lids of blacking-boxes on the stone steps. When\r\neverything is done and over for one at twenty-three, it is pleasant\r\nto let the mind wander forth and follow a young adventurer who has\r\nlife before him. \"And if it had not been for me,\" she thought,\r\n\"Frank might still be free like that, and having a good time making\r\npeople admire him. Poor Frank, getting married wasn't very good\r\nfor him either. I'm afraid I do set people against him, as he says.\r\nI seem, somehow, to give him away all the time. Perhaps he would\r\ntry to be agreeable to people again, if I were not around. It\r\nseems as if I always make him just as bad as he can be.\"\r\n\r\nLater in the winter, Alexandra looked back upon that afternoon as\r\nthe last satisfactory visit she had had with Marie. After that\r\nday the younger woman seemed to shrink more and more into herself.\r\nWhen she was with Alexandra she was not spontaneous and frank\r\nas she used to be. She seemed to be brooding over something, and\r\nholding something back. The weather had a good deal to do with\r\ntheir seeing less of each other than usual. There had not been\r\nsuch snowstorms in twenty years, and the path across the fields was\r\ndrifted deep from Christmas until March. When the two neighbors\r\nwent to see each other, they had to go round by the wagon-road,\r\nwhich was twice as far. They telephoned each other almost every\r\nnight, though in January there was a stretch of three weeks when\r\nthe wires were down, and when the postman did not come at all.\r\n\r\nMarie often ran in to see her nearest neighbor, old Mrs. Hiller,\r\nwho was crippled with rheumatism and had only her son, the lame\r\nshoemaker, to take care of her; and she went to the French Church,\r\nwhatever the weather. She was a sincerely devout girl. She prayed\r\nfor herself and for Frank, and for Emil, among the temptations of\r\nthat gay, corrupt old city. She found more comfort in the Church\r\nthat winter than ever before. It seemed to come closer to her,\r\nand to fill an emptiness that ached in her heart. She tried to\r\nbe patient with her husband. He and his hired man usually played\r\nCalifornia Jack in the evening. Marie sat sewing or crocheting and\r\ntried to take a friendly interest in the game, but she was always\r\nthinking about the wide fields outside, where the snow was drifting\r\nover the fences; and about the orchard, where the snow was falling\r\nand packing, crust over crust. When she went out into the dark\r\nkitchen to fix her plants for the night, she used to stand by the\r\nwindow and look out at the white fields, or watch the currents of\r\nsnow whirling over the orchard. She seemed to feel the weight of\r\nall the snow that lay down there. The branches had become so hard\r\nthat they wounded your hand if you but tried to break a twig. And\r\nyet, down under the frozen crusts, at the roots of the trees, the\r\nsecret of life was still safe, warm as the blood in one's heart;\r\nand the spring would come again! Oh, it would come again!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIf Alexandra had had much imagination she might have guessed what\r\nwas going on in Marie's mind, and she would have seen long before\r\nwhat was going on in Emil's. But that, as Emil himself had more\r\nthan once reflected, was Alexandra's blind side, and her life had\r\nnot been of the kind to sharpen her vision. Her training had all\r\nbeen toward the end of making her proficient in what she had undertaken\r\nto do. Her personal life, her own realization of herself, was\r\nalmost a subconscious existence; like an underground river that\r\ncame to the surface only here and there, at intervals months apart,\r\nand then sank again to flow on under her own fields. Nevertheless,\r\nthe underground stream was there, and it was because she had so much\r\npersonality to put into her enterprises and succeeded in putting\r\nit into them so completely, that her affairs prospered better than\r\nthose of her neighbors.\r\n\r\nThere were certain days in her life, outwardly uneventful, which\r\nAlexandra remembered as peculiarly happy; days when she was close\r\nto the flat, fallow world about her, and felt, as it were, in her\r\nown body the joyous germination in the soil. There were days,\r\ntoo, which she and Emil had spent together, upon which she loved\r\nto look back. There had been such a day when they were down on\r\nthe river in the dry year, looking over the land. They had made\r\nan early start one morning and had driven a long way before noon.\r\nWhen Emil said he was hungry, they drew back from the road, gave\r\nBrigham his oats among the bushes, and climbed up to the top of a\r\ngrassy bluff to eat their lunch under the shade of some little elm\r\ntrees. The river was clear there, and shallow, since there had\r\nbeen no rain, and it ran in ripples over the sparkling sand. Under\r\nthe overhanging willows of the opposite bank there was an inlet where\r\nthe water was deeper and flowed so slowly that it seemed to sleep\r\nin the sun. In this little bay a single wild duck was swimming and\r\ndiving and preening her feathers, disporting herself very happily\r\nin the flickering light and shade. They sat for a long time,\r\nwatching the solitary bird take its pleasure. No living thing\r\nhad ever seemed to Alexandra as beautiful as that wild duck. Emil\r\nmust have felt about it as she did, for afterward, when they were\r\nat home, he used sometimes to say, \"Sister, you know our duck down\r\nthere--\" Alexandra remembered that day as one of the happiest in\r\nher life. Years afterward she thought of the duck as still there,\r\nswimming and diving all by herself in the sunlight, a kind of\r\nenchanted bird that did not know age or change.\r\n\r\nMost of Alexandra's happy memories were as impersonal as this one;\r\nyet to her they were very personal. Her mind was a white book,\r\nwith clear writing about weather and beasts and growing things.\r\nNot many people would have cared to read it; only a happy few.\r\nShe had never been in love, she had never indulged in sentimental\r\nreveries. Even as a girl she had looked upon men as work-fellows.\r\nShe had grown up in serious times.\r\n\r\nThere was one fancy indeed, which persisted through her girlhood.\r\nIt most often came to her on Sunday mornings, the one day in\r\nthe week when she lay late abed listening to the familiar morning\r\nsounds; the windmill singing in the brisk breeze, Emil whistling\r\nas he blacked his boots down by the kitchen door. Sometimes, as\r\nshe lay thus luxuriously idle, her eyes closed, she used to have\r\nan illusion of being lifted up bodily and carried lightly by some\r\none very strong. It was a man, certainly, who carried her, but\r\nhe was like no man she knew; he was much larger and stronger and\r\nswifter, and he carried her as easily as if she were a sheaf of\r\nwheat. She never saw him, but, with eyes closed, she could feel\r\nthat he was yellow like the sunlight, and there was the smell of\r\nripe cornfields about him. She could feel him approach, bend over\r\nher and lift her, and then she could feel herself being carried\r\nswiftly off across the fields. After such a reverie she would rise\r\nhastily, angry with herself, and go down to the bath-house that\r\nwas partitioned off the kitchen shed. There she would stand in a\r\ntin tub and prosecute her bath with vigor, finishing it by pouring\r\nbuckets of cold well-water over her gleaming white body which no\r\nman on the Divide could have carried very far.\r\n\r\nAs she grew older, this fancy more often came to her when she was\r\ntired than when she was fresh and strong. Sometimes, after she had\r\nbeen in the open all day, overseeing the branding of the cattle or\r\nthe loading of the pigs, she would come in chilled, take a concoction\r\nof spices and warm home-made wine, and go to bed with her body\r\nactually aching with fatigue. Then, just before she went to sleep,\r\nshe had the old sensation of being lifted and carried by a strong\r\nbeing who took from her all her bodily weariness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV. The White Mulberry Tree\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe French Church, properly the Church of Sainte-Agnes, stood\r\nupon a hill. The high, narrow, red-brick building, with its tall\r\nsteeple and steep roof, could be seen for miles across the wheatfields,\r\nthough the little town of Sainte-Agnes was completely hidden away\r\nat the foot of the hill. The church looked powerful and triumphant\r\nthere on its eminence, so high above the rest of the landscape,\r\nwith miles of warm color lying at its feet, and by its position and\r\nsetting it reminded one of some of the churches built long ago in\r\nthe wheat-lands of middle France.\r\n\r\nLate one June afternoon Alexandra Bergson was driving along one\r\nof the many roads that led through the rich French farming country\r\nto the big church. The sunlight was shining directly in her face,\r\nand there was a blaze of light all about the red church on the\r\nhill. Beside Alexandra lounged a strikingly exotic figure in a\r\ntall Mexican hat, a silk sash, and a black velvet jacket sewn with\r\nsilver buttons. Emil had returned only the night before, and his\r\nsister was so proud of him that she decided at once to take him up\r\nto the church supper, and to make him wear the Mexican costume he\r\nhad brought home in his trunk. \"All the girls who have stands are\r\ngoing to wear fancy costumes,\" she argued, \"and some of the boys.\r\nMarie is going to tell fortunes, and she sent to Omaha for a Bohemian\r\ndress her father brought back from a visit to the old country.\r\nIf you wear those clothes, they will all be pleased. And you must\r\ntake your guitar. Everybody ought to do what they can to help\r\nalong, and we have never done much. We are not a talented family.\"\r\n\r\nThe supper was to be at six o'clock, in the basement of the church,\r\nand afterward there would be a fair, with charades and an auction.\r\nAlexandra had set out from home early, leaving the house to Signa\r\nand Nelse Jensen, who were to be married next week. Signa had\r\nshyly asked to have the wedding put off until Emil came home.\r\n\r\nAlexandra was well satisfied with her brother. As they drove\r\nthrough the rolling French country toward the westering sun and the\r\nstalwart church, she was thinking of that time long ago when she\r\nand Emil drove back from the river valley to the still unconquered\r\nDivide. Yes, she told herself, it had been worth while; both Emil\r\nand the country had become what she had hoped. Out of her father's\r\nchildren there was one who was fit to cope with the world, who had\r\nnot been tied to the plow, and who had a personality apart from the\r\nsoil. And that, she reflected, was what she had worked for. She\r\nfelt well satisfied with her life.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the church, a score of teams were hitched in\r\nfront of the basement doors that opened from the hillside upon the\r\nsanded terrace, where the boys wrestled and had jumping-matches.\r\nAmedee Chevalier, a proud father of one week, rushed out and\r\nembraced Emil. Amedee was an only son,--hence he was a very rich\r\nyoung man,--but he meant to have twenty children himself, like\r\nhis uncle Xavier. \"Oh, Emil,\" he cried, hugging his old friend\r\nrapturously, \"why ain't you been up to see my boy? You come\r\nto-morrow, sure? Emil, you wanna get a boy right off! It's the\r\ngreatest thing ever! No, no, no! Angel not sick at all. Everything\r\njust fine. That boy he come into this world laughin', and he been\r\nlaughin' ever since. You come an' see!\" He pounded Emil's ribs\r\nto emphasize each announcement.\r\n\r\nEmil caught his arms. \"Stop, Amedee. You're knocking the wind out\r\nof me. I brought him cups and spoons and blankets and moccasins\r\nenough for an orphan asylum. I'm awful glad it's a boy, sure\r\nenough!\"\r\n\r\nThe young men crowded round Emil to admire his costume and to tell\r\nhim in a breath everything that had happened since he went away.\r\nEmil had more friends up here in the French country than down on\r\nNorway Creek. The French and Bohemian boys were spirited and jolly,\r\nliked variety, and were as much predisposed to favor anything new\r\nas the Scandinavian boys were to reject it. The Norwegian and\r\nSwedish lads were much more self-centred, apt to be egotistical\r\nand jealous. They were cautious and reserved with Emil because he\r\nhad been away to college, and were prepared to take him down if he\r\nshould try to put on airs with them. The French boys liked a bit\r\nof swagger, and they were always delighted to hear about anything\r\nnew: new clothes, new games, new songs, new dances. Now they\r\ncarried Emil off to show him the club room they had just fitted up\r\nover the post-office, down in the village. They ran down the hill\r\nin a drove, all laughing and chattering at once, some in French,\r\nsome in English.\r\n\r\nAlexandra went into the cool, whitewashed basement where the women\r\nwere setting the tables. Marie was standing on a chair, building\r\na little tent of shawls where she was to tell fortunes. She sprang\r\ndown and ran toward Alexandra, stopping short and looking at her\r\nin disappointment. Alexandra nodded to her encouragingly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he will be here, Marie. The boys have taken him off to show\r\nhim something. You won't know him. He is a man now, sure enough.\r\nI have no boy left. He smokes terrible-smelling Mexican cigarettes\r\nand talks Spanish. How pretty you look, child. Where did you get\r\nthose beautiful earrings?\"\r\n\r\n\"They belonged to father's mother. He always promised them to me.\r\nHe sent them with the dress and said I could keep them.\"\r\n\r\nMarie wore a short red skirt of stoutly woven cloth, a white bodice\r\nand kirtle, a yellow silk turban wound low over her brown curls,\r\nand long coral pendants in her ears. Her ears had been pierced\r\nagainst a piece of cork by her great-aunt when she was seven years\r\nold. In those germless days she had worn bits of broom-straw, plucked\r\nfrom the common sweeping-broom, in the lobes until the holes were\r\nhealed and ready for little gold rings.\r\n\r\nWhen Emil came back from the village, he lingered outside on the\r\nterrace with the boys. Marie could hear him talking and strumming\r\non his guitar while Raoul Marcel sang falsetto. She was vexed\r\nwith him for staying out there. It made her very nervous to hear\r\nhim and not to see him; for, certainly, she told herself, she was\r\nnot going out to look for him. When the supper bell rang and the\r\nboys came trooping in to get seats at the first table, she forgot\r\nall about her annoyance and ran to greet the tallest of the crowd,\r\nin his conspicuous attire. She didn't mind showing her embarrassment\r\nat all. She blushed and laughed excitedly as she gave Emil her\r\nhand, and looked delightedly at the black velvet coat that brought\r\nout his fair skin and fine blond head. Marie was incapable of being\r\nlukewarm about anything that pleased her. She simply did not know\r\nhow to give a half-hearted response. When she was delighted, she\r\nwas as likely as not to stand on her tip-toes and clap her hands.\r\nIf people laughed at her, she laughed with them.\r\n\r\n\"Do the men wear clothes like that every day, in the street?\" She\r\ncaught Emil by his sleeve and turned him about. \"Oh, I wish I lived\r\nwhere people wore things like that! Are the buttons real silver?\r\nPut on the hat, please. What a heavy thing! How do you ever wear\r\nit? Why don't you tell us about the bull-fights?\"\r\n\r\nShe wanted to wring all his experiences from him at once, without\r\nwaiting a moment. Emil smiled tolerantly and stood looking down at\r\nher with his old, brooding gaze, while the French girls fluttered\r\nabout him in their white dresses and ribbons, and Alexandra watched\r\nthe scene with pride. Several of the French girls, Marie knew, were\r\nhoping that Emil would take them to supper, and she was relieved\r\nwhen he took only his sister. Marie caught Frank's arm and dragged\r\nhim to the same table, managing to get seats opposite the Bergsons,\r\nso that she could hear what they were talking about. Alexandra\r\nmade Emil tell Mrs. Xavier Chevalier, the mother of the twenty,\r\nabout how he had seen a famous matador killed in the bull-ring.\r\nMarie listened to every word, only taking her eyes from Emil to\r\nwatch Frank's plate and keep it filled. When Emil finished his\r\naccount,--bloody enough to satisfy Mrs. Xavier and to make her\r\nfeel thankful that she was not a matador,--Marie broke out with\r\na volley of questions. How did the women dress when they went to\r\nbull-fights? Did they wear mantillas? Did they never wear hats?\r\n\r\nAfter supper the young people played charades for the amusement\r\nof their elders, who sat gossiping between their guesses. All the\r\nshops in Sainte-Agnes were closed at eight o'clock that night, so\r\nthat the merchants and their clerks could attend the fair. The\r\nauction was the liveliest part of the entertainment, for the French\r\nboys always lost their heads when they began to bid, satisfied that\r\ntheir extravagance was in a good cause. After all the pincushions\r\nand sofa pillows and embroidered slippers were sold, Emil precipitated\r\na panic by taking out one of his turquoise shirt studs, which every\r\none had been admiring, and handing it to the auctioneer. All the\r\nFrench girls clamored for it, and their sweethearts bid against\r\neach other recklessly. Marie wanted it, too, and she kept making\r\nsignals to Frank, which he took a sour pleasure in disregarding.\r\nHe didn't see the use of making a fuss over a fellow just because\r\nhe was dressed like a clown. When the turquoise went to Malvina\r\nSauvage, the French banker's daughter, Marie shrugged her shoulders\r\nand betook herself to her little tent of shawls, where she began\r\nto shuffle her cards by the light of a tallow candle, calling out,\r\n\"Fortunes, fortunes!\"\r\n\r\nThe young priest, Father Duchesne, went first to have his fortune\r\nread. Marie took his long white hand, looked at it, and then\r\nbegan to run off her cards. \"I see a long journey across water for\r\nyou, Father. You will go to a town all cut up by water; built on\r\nislands, it seems to be, with rivers and green fields all about.\r\nAnd you will visit an old lady with a white cap and gold hoops in\r\nher ears, and you will be very happy there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mais, oui,\" said the priest, with a melancholy smile. \"C'est\r\nL'Isle-Adam, chez ma mere. Vous etes tres savante, ma fille.\" He\r\npatted her yellow turban, calling, \"Venez donc, mes garcons! Il\r\ny a ici une veritable clairvoyante!\"\r\n\r\nMarie was clever at fortune-telling, indulging in a light irony\r\nthat amused the crowd. She told old Brunot, the miser, that he\r\nwould lose all his money, marry a girl of sixteen, and live happily\r\non a crust. Sholte, the fat Russian boy, who lived for his stomach,\r\nwas to be disappointed in love, grow thin, and shoot himself from\r\ndespondency. Amedee was to have twenty children, and nineteen of\r\nthem were to be girls. Amedee slapped Frank on the back and asked\r\nhim why he didn't see what the fortune-teller would promise him.\r\nBut Frank shook off his friendly hand and grunted, \"She tell my\r\nfortune long ago; bad enough!\" Then he withdrew to a corner and\r\nsat glowering at his wife.\r\n\r\nFrank's case was all the more painful because he had no one\r\nin particular to fix his jealousy upon. Sometimes he could have\r\nthanked the man who would bring him evidence against his wife.\r\nHe had discharged a good farm-boy, Jan Smirka, because he thought\r\nMarie was fond of him; but she had not seemed to miss Jan when\r\nhe was gone, and she had been just as kind to the next boy. The\r\nfarm-hands would always do anything for Marie; Frank couldn't find\r\none so surly that he would not make an effort to please her. At\r\nthe bottom of his heart Frank knew well enough that if he could once\r\ngive up his grudge, his wife would come back to him. But he could\r\nnever in the world do that. The grudge was fundamental. Perhaps\r\nhe could not have given it up if he had tried. Perhaps he got more\r\nsatisfaction out of feeling himself abused than he would have got\r\nout of being loved. If he could once have made Marie thoroughly\r\nunhappy, he might have relented and raised her from the dust. But\r\nshe had never humbled herself. In the first days of their love\r\nshe had been his slave; she had admired him abandonedly. But the\r\nmoment he began to bully her and to be unjust, she began to draw\r\naway; at first in tearful amazement, then in quiet, unspoken disgust.\r\nThe distance between them had widened and hardened. It no longer\r\ncontracted and brought them suddenly together. The spark of her\r\nlife went somewhere else, and he was always watching to surprise\r\nit. He knew that somewhere she must get a feeling to live upon,\r\nfor she was not a woman who could live without loving. He wanted\r\nto prove to himself the wrong he felt. What did she hide in her\r\nheart? Where did it go? Even Frank had his churlish delicacies;\r\nhe never reminded her of how much she had once loved him. For that\r\nMarie was grateful to him.\r\n\r\nWhile Marie was chattering to the French boys, Amedee called Emil\r\nto the back of the room and whispered to him that they were going\r\nto play a joke on the girls. At eleven o'clock, Amedee was to go\r\nup to the switchboard in the vestibule and turn off the electric\r\nlights, and every boy would have a chance to kiss his sweetheart\r\nbefore Father Duchesne could find his way up the stairs to turn the\r\ncurrent on again. The only difficulty was the candle in Marie's\r\ntent; perhaps, as Emil had no sweetheart, he would oblige the boys\r\nby blowing out the candle. Emil said he would undertake to do\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nAt five minutes to eleven he sauntered up to Marie's booth, and\r\nthe French boys dispersed to find their girls. He leaned over the\r\ncard-table and gave himself up to looking at her. \"Do you think\r\nyou could tell my fortune?\" he murmured. It was the first word he\r\nhad had alone with her for almost a year. \"My luck hasn't changed\r\nany. It's just the same.\"\r\n\r\nMarie had often wondered whether there was anyone else who could\r\nlook his thoughts to you as Emil could. To-night, when she met his\r\nsteady, powerful eyes, it was impossible not to feel the sweetness\r\nof the dream he was dreaming; it reached her before she could shut\r\nit out, and hid itself in her heart. She began to shuffle her\r\ncards furiously. \"I'm angry with you, Emil,\" she broke out with\r\npetulance. \"Why did you give them that lovely blue stone to sell?\r\nYou might have known Frank wouldn't buy it for me, and I wanted it\r\nawfully!\"\r\n\r\nEmil laughed shortly. \"People who want such little things surely\r\nought to have them,\" he said dryly. He thrust his hand into the\r\npocket of his velvet trousers and brought out a handful of uncut\r\nturquoises, as big as marbles. Leaning over the table he dropped\r\nthem into her lap. \"There, will those do? Be careful, don't let\r\nany one see them. Now, I suppose you want me to go away and let\r\nyou play with them?\"\r\n\r\nMarie was gazing in rapture at the soft blue color of the stones.\r\n\"Oh, Emil! Is everything down there beautiful like these? How\r\ncould you ever come away?\"\r\n\r\nAt that instant Amedee laid hands on the switchboard. There was a\r\nshiver and a giggle, and every one looked toward the red blur that\r\nMarie's candle made in the dark. Immediately that, too, was gone.\r\nLittle shrieks and currents of soft laughter ran up and down the\r\ndark hall. Marie started up,--directly into Emil's arms. In the\r\nsame instant she felt his lips. The veil that had hung uncertainly\r\nbetween them for so long was dissolved. Before she knew what she\r\nwas doing, she had committed herself to that kiss that was at once\r\na boy's and a man's, as timid as it was tender; so like Emil and\r\nso unlike any one else in the world. Not until it was over did\r\nshe realize what it meant. And Emil, who had so often imagined\r\nthe shock of this first kiss, was surprised at its gentleness and\r\nnaturalness. It was like a sigh which they had breathed together;\r\nalmost sorrowful, as if each were afraid of wakening something in\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nWhen the lights came on again, everybody was laughing and shouting,\r\nand all the French girls were rosy and shining with mirth. Only\r\nMarie, in her little tent of shawls, was pale and quiet. Under her\r\nyellow turban the red coral pendants swung against white cheeks.\r\nFrank was still staring at her, but he seemed to see nothing. Years\r\nago, he himself had had the power to take the blood from her cheeks\r\nlike that. Perhaps he did not remember--perhaps he had never\r\nnoticed! Emil was already at the other end of the hall, walking\r\nabout with the shoulder-motion he had acquired among the Mexicans,\r\nstudying the floor with his intent, deep-set eyes. Marie began to\r\ntake down and fold her shawls. She did not glance up again. The\r\nyoung people drifted to the other end of the hall where the guitar\r\nwas sounding. In a moment she heard Emil and Raoul singing:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Across the Rio Grand-e There lies a sunny land-e, My bright-eyed\r\nMexico!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexandra Bergson came up to the card booth. \"Let me help you,\r\nMarie. You look tired.\"\r\n\r\nShe placed her hand on Marie's arm and felt her shiver. Marie\r\nstiffened under that kind, calm hand. Alexandra drew back, perplexed\r\nand hurt.\r\n\r\nThere was about Alexandra something of the impervious calm of the\r\nfatalist, always disconcerting to very young people, who cannot\r\nfeel that the heart lives at all unless it is still at the mercy\r\nof storms; unless its strings can scream to the touch of pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nSigna's wedding supper was over. The guests, and the tiresome\r\nlittle Norwegian preacher who had performed the marriage ceremony,\r\nwere saying good-night. Old Ivar was hitching the horses to the\r\nwagon to take the wedding presents and the bride and groom up to\r\ntheir new home, on Alexandra's north quarter. When Ivar drove up\r\nto the gate, Emil and Marie Shabata began to carry out the presents,\r\nand Alexandra went into her bedroom to bid Signa good-bye and to\r\ngive her a few words of good counsel. She was surprised to find\r\nthat the bride had changed her slippers for heavy shoes and was\r\npinning up her skirts. At that moment Nelse appeared at the gate\r\nwith the two milk cows that Alexandra had given Signa for a wedding\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nAlexandra began to laugh. \"Why, Signa, you and Nelse are to ride\r\nhome. I'll send Ivar over with the cows in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nSigna hesitated and looked perplexed. When her husband called her,\r\nshe pinned her hat on resolutely. \"I ta-ank I better do yust like\r\nhe say,\" she murmured in confusion.\r\n\r\nAlexandra and Marie accompanied Signa to the gate and saw the\r\nparty set off, old Ivar driving ahead in the wagon and the bride\r\nand groom following on foot, each leading a cow. Emil burst into\r\na laugh before they were out of hearing.\r\n\r\n\"Those two will get on,\" said Alexandra as they turned back to the\r\nhouse. \"They are not going to take any chances. They will feel\r\nsafer with those cows in their own stable. Marie, I am going to\r\nsend for an old woman next. As soon as I get the girls broken in,\r\nI marry them off.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've no patience with Signa, marrying that grumpy fellow!\" Marie\r\ndeclared. \"I wanted her to marry that nice Smirka boy who worked\r\nfor us last winter. I think she liked him, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think she did,\" Alexandra assented, \"but I suppose she was\r\ntoo much afraid of Nelse to marry any one else. Now that I think\r\nof it, most of my girls have married men they were afraid of. I\r\nbelieve there is a good deal of the cow in most Swedish girls.\r\nYou high-strung Bohemian can't understand us. We're a terribly\r\npractical people, and I guess we think a cross man makes a good\r\nmanager.\"\r\n\r\nMarie shrugged her shoulders and turned to pin up a lock of hair\r\nthat had fallen on her neck. Somehow Alexandra had irritated her\r\nof late. Everybody irritated her. She was tired of everybody. \"I'm\r\ngoing home alone, Emil, so you needn't get your hat,\" she said as\r\nshe wound her scarf quickly about her head. \"Good-night, Alexandra,\"\r\nshe called back in a strained voice, running down the gravel walk.\r\n\r\nEmil followed with long strides until he overtook her. Then she began\r\nto walk slowly. It was a night of warm wind and faint starlight,\r\nand the fireflies were glimmering over the wheat.\r\n\r\n\"Marie,\" said Emil after they had walked for a while, \"I wonder if\r\nyou know how unhappy I am?\"\r\n\r\nMarie did not answer him. Her head, in its white scarf, drooped\r\nforward a little.\r\n\r\nEmil kicked a clod from the path and went on:--\r\n\r\n\"I wonder whether you are really shallow-hearted, like you seem?\r\nSometimes I think one boy does just as well as another for you.\r\nIt never seems to make much difference whether it is me or Raoul\r\nMarcel or Jan Smirka. Are you really like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I am. What do you want me to do? Sit round and cry all\r\nday? When I've cried until I can't cry any more, then--then I must\r\ndo something else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sorry for me?\" he persisted.\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm not. If I were big and free like you, I wouldn't let\r\nanything make me unhappy. As old Napoleon Brunot said at the fair,\r\nI wouldn't go lovering after no woman. I'd take the first train\r\nand go off and have all the fun there is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tried that, but it didn't do any good. Everything reminded me.\r\nThe nicer the place was, the more I wanted you.\" They had come to\r\nthe stile and Emil pointed to it persuasively. \"Sit down a moment,\r\nI want to ask you something.\" Marie sat down on the top step and\r\nEmil drew nearer. \"Would you tell me something that's none of my\r\nbusiness if you thought it would help me out? Well, then, tell\r\nme, PLEASE tell me, why you ran away with Frank Shabata!\"\r\n\r\nMarie drew back. \"Because I was in love with him,\" she said firmly.\r\n\r\n\"Really?\" he asked incredulously.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed. Very much in love with him. I think I was the one\r\nwho suggested our running away. From the first it was more my\r\nfault than his.\"\r\n\r\nEmil turned away his face.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" Marie went on, \"I've got to remember that. Frank is\r\njust the same now as he was then, only then I would see him as I\r\nwanted him to be. I would have my own way. And now I pay for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't do all the paying.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it. When one makes a mistake, there's no telling where\r\nit will stop. But you can go away; you can leave all this behind\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not everything. I can't leave you behind. Will you go away with\r\nme, Marie?\"\r\n\r\nMarie started up and stepped across the stile. \"Emil! How wickedly\r\nyou talk! I am not that kind of a girl, and you know it. But what\r\nam I going to do if you keep tormenting me like this!\" she added\r\nplaintively.\r\n\r\n\"Marie, I won't bother you any more if you will tell me just\r\none thing. Stop a minute and look at me. No, nobody can see us.\r\nEverybody's asleep. That was only a firefly. Marie, STOP and tell\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\nEmil overtook her and catching her by the shoulders shook her\r\ngently, as if he were trying to awaken a sleepwalker.\r\n\r\nMarie hid her face on his arm. \"Don't ask me anything more. I\r\ndon't know anything except how miserable I am. And I thought it\r\nwould be all right when you came back. Oh, Emil,\" she clutched his\r\nsleeve and began to cry, \"what am I to do if you don't go away? I\r\ncan't go, and one of us must. Can't you see?\"\r\n\r\nEmil stood looking down at her, holding his shoulders stiff and\r\nstiffening the arm to which she clung. Her white dress looked\r\ngray in the darkness. She seemed like a troubled spirit, like some\r\nshadow out of the earth, clinging to him and entreating him to give\r\nher peace. Behind her the fireflies were weaving in and out over\r\nthe wheat. He put his hand on her bent head. \"On my honor, Marie,\r\nif you will say you love me, I will go away.\"\r\n\r\nShe lifted her face to his. \"How could I help it? Didn't you\r\nknow?\"\r\n\r\nEmil was the one who trembled, through all his frame. After he\r\nleft Marie at her gate, he wandered about the fields all night,\r\ntill morning put out the fireflies and the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nOne evening, a week after Signa's wedding, Emil was kneeling before\r\na box in the sitting-room, packing his books. From time to time\r\nhe rose and wandered about the house, picking up stray volumes and\r\nbringing them listlessly back to his box. He was packing without\r\nenthusiasm. He was not very sanguine about his future. Alexandra\r\nsat sewing by the table. She had helped him pack his trunk in\r\nthe afternoon. As Emil came and went by her chair with his books,\r\nhe thought to himself that it had not been so hard to leave his\r\nsister since he first went away to school. He was going directly\r\nto Omaha, to read law in the office of a Swedish lawyer until\r\nOctober, when he would enter the law school at Ann Arbor. They\r\nhad planned that Alexandra was to come to Michigan--a long journey\r\nfor her--at Christmas time, and spend several weeks with him.\r\nNevertheless, he felt that this leave-taking would be more final\r\nthan his earlier ones had been; that it meant a definite break with\r\nhis old home and the beginning of something new--he did not know\r\nwhat. His ideas about the future would not crystallize; the more\r\nhe tried to think about it, the vaguer his conception of it became.\r\nBut one thing was clear, he told himself; it was high time that he\r\nmade good to Alexandra, and that ought to be incentive enough to\r\nbegin with.\r\n\r\nAs he went about gathering up his books he felt as if he were\r\nuprooting things. At last he threw himself down on the old slat\r\nlounge where he had slept when he was little, and lay looking up\r\nat the familiar cracks in the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\"Tired, Emil?\" his sister asked.\r\n\r\n\"Lazy,\" he murmured, turning on his side and looking at her. He\r\nstudied Alexandra's face for a long time in the lamplight. It had\r\nnever occurred to him that his sister was a handsome woman until\r\nMarie Shabata had told him so. Indeed, he had never thought of\r\nher as being a woman at all, only a sister. As he studied her bent\r\nhead, he looked up at the picture of John Bergson above the lamp.\r\n\"No,\" he thought to himself, \"she didn't get it there. I suppose\r\nI am more like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alexandra,\" he said suddenly, \"that old walnut secretary you use\r\nfor a desk was father's, wasn't it?\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra went on stitching. \"Yes. It was one of the first things\r\nhe bought for the old log house. It was a great extravagance\r\nin those days. But he wrote a great many letters back to the old\r\ncountry. He had many friends there, and they wrote to him up to the\r\ntime he died. No one ever blamed him for grandfather's disgrace.\r\nI can see him now, sitting there on Sundays, in his white shirt,\r\nwriting pages and pages, so carefully. He wrote a fine, regular\r\nhand, almost like engraving. Yours is something like his, when\r\nyou take pains.\"\r\n\r\n\"Grandfather was really crooked, was he?\"\r\n\r\n\"He married an unscrupulous woman, and then--then I'm afraid he\r\nwas really crooked. When we first came here father used to have\r\ndreams about making a great fortune and going back to Sweden to\r\npay back to the poor sailors the money grandfather had lost.\"\r\n\r\nEmil stirred on the lounge. \"I say, that would have been worth\r\nwhile, wouldn't it? Father wasn't a bit like Lou or Oscar, was\r\nhe? I can't remember much about him before he got sick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, not at all!\" Alexandra dropped her sewing on her knee. \"He\r\nhad better opportunities; not to make money, but to make something\r\nof himself. He was a quiet man, but he was very intelligent. You\r\nwould have been proud of him, Emil.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra felt that he would like to know there had been a man of\r\nhis kin whom he could admire. She knew that Emil was ashamed of\r\nLou and Oscar, because they were bigoted and self-satisfied. He\r\nnever said much about them, but she could feel his disgust. His\r\nbrothers had shown their disapproval of him ever since he first\r\nwent away to school. The only thing that would have satisfied them\r\nwould have been his failure at the University. As it was, they\r\nresented every change in his speech, in his dress, in his point of\r\nview; though the latter they had to conjecture, for Emil avoided\r\ntalking to them about any but family matters. All his interests\r\nthey treated as affectations.\r\n\r\nAlexandra took up her sewing again. \"I can remember father when\r\nhe was quite a young man. He belonged to some kind of a musical\r\nsociety, a male chorus, in Stockholm. I can remember going with\r\nmother to hear them sing. There must have been a hundred of them,\r\nand they all wore long black coats and white neckties. I was\r\nused to seeing father in a blue coat, a sort of jacket, and when I\r\nrecognized him on the platform, I was very proud. Do you remember\r\nthat Swedish song he taught you, about the ship boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I used to sing it to the Mexicans. They like anything\r\ndifferent.\" Emil paused. \"Father had a hard fight here, didn't\r\nhe?\" he added thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and he died in a dark time. Still, he had hope. He believed\r\nin the land.\"\r\n\r\n\"And in you, I guess,\" Emil said to himself. There was another\r\nperiod of silence; that warm, friendly silence, full of perfect\r\nunderstanding, in which Emil and Alexandra had spent many of their\r\nhappiest half-hours.\r\n\r\nAt last Emil said abruptly, \"Lou and Oscar would be better off if\r\nthey were poor, wouldn't they?\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra smiled. \"Maybe. But their children wouldn't. I have\r\ngreat hopes of Milly.\"\r\n\r\nEmil shivered. \"I don't know. Seems to me it gets worse as it\r\ngoes on. The worst of the Swedes is that they're never willing\r\nto find out how much they don't know. It was like that at the\r\nUniversity. Always so pleased with themselves! There's no getting\r\nbehind that conceited Swedish grin. The Bohemians and Germans were\r\nso different.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, Emil, don't go back on your own people. Father wasn't\r\nconceited, Uncle Otto wasn't. Even Lou and Oscar weren't when they\r\nwere boys.\"\r\n\r\nEmil looked incredulous, but he did not dispute the point. He\r\nturned on his back and lay still for a long time, his hands locked\r\nunder his head, looking up at the ceiling. Alexandra knew that he\r\nwas thinking of many things. She felt no anxiety about Emil. She\r\nhad always believed in him, as she had believed in the land. He\r\nhad been more like himself since he got back from Mexico; seemed\r\nglad to be at home, and talked to her as he used to do. She had\r\nno doubt that his wandering fit was over, and that he would soon\r\nbe settled in life.\r\n\r\n\"Alexandra,\" said Emil suddenly, \"do you remember the wild duck we\r\nsaw down on the river that time?\"\r\n\r\nHis sister looked up. \"I often think of her. It always seems to\r\nme she's there still, just like we saw her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. It's queer what things one remembers and what things one\r\nforgets.\" Emil yawned and sat up. \"Well, it's time to turn in.\"\r\nHe rose, and going over to Alexandra stooped down and kissed her\r\nlightly on the cheek. \"Good-night, sister. I think you did pretty\r\nwell by us.\"\r\n\r\nEmil took up his lamp and went upstairs. Alexandra sat finishing\r\nhis new nightshirt, that must go in the top tray of his trunk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe next morning Angelique, Amedee's wife, was in the kitchen baking\r\npies, assisted by old Mrs. Chevalier. Between the mixing-board\r\nand the stove stood the old cradle that had been Amedee's, and in\r\nit was his black-eyed son. As Angelique, flushed and excited, with\r\nflour on her hands, stopped to smile at the baby, Emil Bergson rode\r\nup to the kitchen door on his mare and dismounted.\r\n\r\n\"'Medee is out in the field, Emil,\" Angelique called as she ran\r\nacross the kitchen to the oven. \"He begins to cut his wheat to-day;\r\nthe first wheat ready to cut anywhere about here. He bought a new\r\nheader, you know, because all the wheat's so short this year. I\r\nhope he can rent it to the neighbors, it cost so much. He and his\r\ncousins bought a steam thresher on shares. You ought to go out and\r\nsee that header work. I watched it an hour this morning, busy as\r\nI am with all the men to feed. He has a lot of hands, but he's\r\nthe only one that knows how to drive the header or how to run the\r\nengine, so he has to be everywhere at once. He's sick, too, and\r\nought to be in his bed.\"\r\n\r\nEmil bent over Hector Baptiste, trying to make him blink his round,\r\nbead-like black eyes. \"Sick? What's the matter with your daddy,\r\nkid? Been making him walk the floor with you?\"\r\n\r\nAngelique sniffed. \"Not much! We don't have that kind of babies.\r\nIt was his father that kept Baptiste awake. All night I had to be\r\ngetting up and making mustard plasters to put on his stomach. He\r\nhad an awful colic. He said he felt better this morning, but I\r\ndon't think he ought to be out in the field, overheating himself.\"\r\n\r\nAngelique did not speak with much anxiety, not because she was\r\nindifferent, but because she felt so secure in their good fortune.\r\nOnly good things could happen to a rich, energetic, handsome young\r\nman like Amedee, with a new baby in the cradle and a new header in\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nEmil stroked the black fuzz on Baptiste's head. \"I say, Angelique,\r\none of 'Medee's grandmothers, 'way back, must have been a squaw.\r\nThis kid looks exactly like the Indian babies.\"\r\n\r\nAngelique made a face at him, but old Mrs. Chevalier had been\r\ntouched on a sore point, and she let out such a stream of fiery\r\nPATOIS that Emil fled from the kitchen and mounted his mare.\r\n\r\nOpening the pasture gate from the saddle, Emil rode across the field\r\nto the clearing where the thresher stood, driven by a stationary\r\nengine and fed from the header boxes. As Amedee was not on the\r\nengine, Emil rode on to the wheatfield, where he recognized, on\r\nthe header, the slight, wiry figure of his friend, coatless, his\r\nwhite shirt puffed out by the wind, his straw hat stuck jauntily\r\non the side of his head. The six big work-horses that drew, or\r\nrather pushed, the header, went abreast at a rapid walk, and as they\r\nwere still green at the work they required a good deal of management\r\non Amedee's part; especially when they turned the corners, where\r\nthey divided, three and three, and then swung round into line again\r\nwith a movement that looked as complicated as a wheel of artillery.\r\nEmil felt a new thrill of admiration for his friend, and with it\r\nthe old pang of envy at the way in which Amedee could do with his\r\nmight what his hand found to do, and feel that, whatever it was,\r\nit was the most important thing in the world. \"I'll have to bring\r\nAlexandra up to see this thing work,\" Emil thought; \"it's splendid!\"\r\n\r\nWhen he saw Emil, Amedee waved to him and called to one of his\r\ntwenty cousins to take the reins. Stepping off the header without\r\nstopping it, he ran up to Emil who had dismounted. \"Come along,\"\r\nhe called. \"I have to go over to the engine for a minute. I gotta\r\ngreen man running it, and I gotta to keep an eye on him.\"\r\n\r\nEmil thought the lad was unnaturally flushed and more excited than\r\neven the cares of managing a big farm at a critical time warranted.\r\nAs they passed behind a last year's stack, Amedee clutched at his\r\nright side and sank down for a moment on the straw.\r\n\r\n\"Ouch! I got an awful pain in me, Emil. Something's the matter\r\nwith my insides, for sure.\"\r\n\r\nEmil felt his fiery cheek. \"You ought to go straight to bed,\r\n'Medee, and telephone for the doctor; that's what you ought to do.\"\r\n\r\nAmedee staggered up with a gesture of despair. \"How can I? I got\r\nno time to be sick. Three thousand dollars' worth of new machinery\r\nto manage, and the wheat so ripe it will begin to shatter next\r\nweek. My wheat's short, but it's gotta grand full berries. What's\r\nhe slowing down for? We haven't got header boxes enough to feed\r\nthe thresher, I guess.\"\r\n\r\nAmedee started hot-foot across the stubble, leaning a little to the\r\nright as he ran, and waved to the engineer not to stop the engine.\r\n\r\nEmil saw that this was no time to talk about his own affairs. He\r\nmounted his mare and rode on to Sainte-Agnes, to bid his friends\r\nthere good-bye. He went first to see Raoul Marcel, and found him\r\ninnocently practising the \"Gloria\" for the big confirmation service\r\non Sunday while he polished the mirrors of his father's saloon.\r\n\r\nAs Emil rode homewards at three o'clock in the afternoon, he saw\r\nAmedee staggering out of the wheatfield, supported by two of his\r\ncousins. Emil stopped and helped them put the boy to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nWhen Frank Shabata came in from work at five o'clock that evening,\r\nold Moses Marcel, Raoul's father, telephoned him that Amedee had\r\nhad a seizure in the wheatfield, and that Doctor Paradis was going\r\nto operate on him as soon as the Hanover doctor got there to help.\r\nFrank dropped a word of this at the table, bolted his supper, and\r\nrode off to Sainte-Agnes, where there would be sympathetic discussion\r\nof Amedee's case at Marcel's saloon.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Frank was gone, Marie telephoned Alexandra. It was a\r\ncomfort to hear her friend's voice. Yes, Alexandra knew what there\r\nwas to be known about Amedee. Emil had been there when they carried\r\nhim out of the field, and had stayed with him until the doctors\r\noperated for appendicitis at five o'clock. They were afraid it\r\nwas too late to do much good; it should have been done three days\r\nago. Amedee was in a very bad way. Emil had just come home, worn\r\nout and sick himself. She had given him some brandy and put him\r\nto bed.\r\n\r\nMarie hung up the receiver. Poor Amedee's illness had taken on a\r\nnew meaning to her, now that she knew Emil had been with him. And\r\nit might so easily have been the other way--Emil who was ill and\r\nAmedee who was sad! Marie looked about the dusky sitting-room.\r\nShe had seldom felt so utterly lonely. If Emil was asleep, there\r\nwas not even a chance of his coming; and she could not go to\r\nAlexandra for sympathy. She meant to tell Alexandra everything,\r\nas soon as Emil went away. Then whatever was left between them\r\nwould be honest.\r\n\r\nBut she could not stay in the house this evening. Where should she\r\ngo? She walked slowly down through the orchard, where the evening\r\nair was heavy with the smell of wild cotton. The fresh, salty scent\r\nof the wild roses had given way before this more powerful perfume\r\nof midsummer. Wherever those ashes-of-rose balls hung on their\r\nmilky stalks, the air about them was saturated with their breath.\r\nThe sky was still red in the west and the evening star hung\r\ndirectly over the Bergsons' wind-mill. Marie crossed the fence at\r\nthe wheatfield corner, and walked slowly along the path that led\r\nto Alexandra's. She could not help feeling hurt that Emil had not\r\ncome to tell her about Amedee. It seemed to her most unnatural\r\nthat he should not have come. If she were in trouble, certainly\r\nhe was the one person in the world she would want to see. Perhaps\r\nhe wished her to understand that for her he was as good as gone\r\nalready.\r\n\r\nMarie stole slowly, flutteringly, along the path, like a white\r\nnight-moth out of the fields. The years seemed to stretch before\r\nher like the land; spring, summer, autumn, winter, spring; always\r\nthe same patient fields, the patient little trees, the patient lives;\r\nalways the same yearning, the same pulling at the chain--until the\r\ninstinct to live had torn itself and bled and weakened for the last\r\ntime, until the chain secured a dead woman, who might cautiously\r\nbe released. Marie walked on, her face lifted toward the remote,\r\ninaccessible evening star.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached the stile she sat down and waited. How terrible\r\nit was to love people when you could not really share their lives!\r\n\r\nYes, in so far as she was concerned, Emil was already gone. They\r\ncouldn't meet any more. There was nothing for them to say. They\r\nhad spent the last penny of their small change; there was nothing\r\nleft but gold. The day of love-tokens was past. They had now\r\nonly their hearts to give each other. And Emil being gone, what\r\nwas her life to be like? In some ways, it would be easier. She\r\nwould not, at least, live in perpetual fear. If Emil were once\r\naway and settled at work, she would not have the feeling that she\r\nwas spoiling his life. With the memory he left her, she could be\r\nas rash as she chose. Nobody could be the worse for it but herself;\r\nand that, surely, did not matter. Her own case was clear. When a\r\ngirl had loved one man, and then loved another while that man was\r\nstill alive, everybody knew what to think of her. What happened\r\nto her was of little consequence, so long as she did not drag other\r\npeople down with her. Emil once away, she could let everything\r\nelse go and live a new life of perfect love.\r\n\r\nMarie left the stile reluctantly. She had, after all, thought he\r\nmight come. And how glad she ought to be, she told herself, that\r\nhe was asleep. She left the path and went across the pasture. The\r\nmoon was almost full. An owl was hooting somewhere in the fields.\r\nShe had scarcely thought about where she was going when the pond\r\nglittered before her, where Emil had shot the ducks. She stopped\r\nand looked at it. Yes, there would be a dirty way out of life, if\r\none chose to take it. But she did not want to die. She wanted to\r\nlive and dream--a hundred years, forever! As long as this sweetness\r\nwelled up in her heart, as long as her breast could hold this\r\ntreasure of pain! She felt as the pond must feel when it held the\r\nmoon like that; when it encircled and swelled with that image of\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, when Emil came down-stairs, Alexandra met him\r\nin the sitting-room and put her hands on his shoulders. \"Emil, I\r\nwent to your room as soon as it was light, but you were sleeping\r\nso sound I hated to wake you. There was nothing you could do, so\r\nI let you sleep. They telephoned from Sainte-Agnes that Amedee\r\ndied at three o'clock this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nThe Church has always held that life is for the living. On Saturday,\r\nwhile half the village of Sainte-Agnes was mourning for Amedee and\r\npreparing the funeral black for his burial on Monday, the other\r\nhalf was busy with white dresses and white veils for the great\r\nconfirmation service to-morrow, when the bishop was to confirm a\r\nclass of one hundred boys and girls. Father Duchesne divided his\r\ntime between the living and the dead. All day Saturday the church\r\nwas a scene of bustling activity, a little hushed by the thought\r\nof Amedee. The choir were busy rehearsing a mass of Rossini, which\r\nthey had studied and practised for this occasion. The women were\r\ntrimming the altar, the boys and girls were bringing flowers.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning the bishop was to drive overland to Sainte-Agnes\r\nfrom Hanover, and Emil Bergson had been asked to take the place of\r\none of Amedee's cousins in the cavalcade of forty French boys who\r\nwere to ride across country to meet the bishop's carriage. At\r\nsix o'clock on Sunday morning the boys met at the church. As they\r\nstood holding their horses by the bridle, they talked in low tones\r\nof their dead comrade. They kept repeating that Amedee had always\r\nbeen a good boy, glancing toward the red brick church which had\r\nplayed so large a part in Amedee's life, had been the scene of his\r\nmost serious moments and of his happiest hours. He had played and\r\nwrestled and sung and courted under its shadow. Only three weeks\r\nago he had proudly carried his baby there to be christened. They\r\ncould not doubt that that invisible arm was still about Amedee; that\r\nthrough the church on earth he had passed to the church triumphant,\r\nthe goal of the hopes and faith of so many hundred years.\r\n\r\nWhen the word was given to mount, the young men rode at a walk out\r\nof the village; but once out among the wheatfields in the morning\r\nsun, their horses and their own youth got the better of them. A\r\nwave of zeal and fiery enthusiasm swept over them. They longed\r\nfor a Jerusalem to deliver. The thud of their galloping hoofs\r\ninterrupted many a country breakfast and brought many a woman and\r\nchild to the door of the farmhouses as they passed. Five miles east\r\nof Sainte-Agnes they met the bishop in his open carriage, attended\r\nby two priests. Like one man the boys swung off their hats in a\r\nbroad salute, and bowed their heads as the handsome old man lifted\r\nhis two fingers in the episcopal blessing. The horsemen closed\r\nabout the carriage like a guard, and whenever a restless horse broke\r\nfrom control and shot down the road ahead of the body, the bishop\r\nlaughed and rubbed his plump hands together. \"What fine boys!\" he\r\nsaid to his priests. \"The Church still has her cavalry.\"\r\n\r\nAs the troop swept past the graveyard half a mile east of the\r\ntown,--the first frame church of the parish had stood there,--old\r\nPierre Seguin was already out with his pick and spade, digging\r\nAmedee's grave. He knelt and uncovered as the bishop passed. The\r\nboys with one accord looked away from old Pierre to the red church\r\non the hill, with the gold cross flaming on its steeple.\r\n\r\nMass was at eleven. While the church was filling, Emil Bergson waited\r\noutside, watching the wagons and buggies drive up the hill. After\r\nthe bell began to ring, he saw Frank Shabata ride up on horseback\r\nand tie his horse to the hitch-bar. Marie, then, was not coming.\r\nEmil turned and went into the church. Amedee's was the only empty\r\npew, and he sat down in it. Some of Amedee's cousins were there,\r\ndressed in black and weeping. When all the pews were full, the\r\nold men and boys packed the open space at the back of the church,\r\nkneeling on the floor. There was scarcely a family in town that was\r\nnot represented in the confirmation class, by a cousin, at least.\r\nThe new communicants, with their clear, reverent faces, were beautiful\r\nto look upon as they entered in a body and took the front benches\r\nreserved for them. Even before the Mass began, the air was charged\r\nwith feeling. The choir had never sung so well and Raoul Marcel,\r\nin the \"Gloria,\" drew even the bishop's eyes to the organ loft.\r\nFor the offertory he sang Gounod's \"Ave Maria,\"--always spoken of\r\nin Sainte-Agnes as \"the Ave Maria.\"\r\n\r\nEmil began to torture himself with questions about Marie. Was she\r\nill? Had she quarreled with her husband? Was she too unhappy to\r\nfind comfort even here? Had she, perhaps, thought that he would\r\ncome to her? Was she waiting for him? Overtaxed by excitement\r\nand sorrow as he was, the rapture of the service took hold upon his\r\nbody and mind. As he listened to Raoul, he seemed to emerge from\r\nthe conflicting emotions which had been whirling him about and\r\nsucking him under. He felt as if a clear light broke upon his\r\nmind, and with it a conviction that good was, after all, stronger\r\nthan evil, and that good was possible to men. He seemed to discover\r\nthat there was a kind of rapture in which he could love forever\r\nwithout faltering and without sin. He looked across the heads of\r\nthe people at Frank Shabata with calmness. That rapture was for those\r\nwho could feel it; for people who could not, it was non-existent.\r\nHe coveted nothing that was Frank Shabata's. The spirit he had\r\nmet in music was his own. Frank Shabata had never found it; would\r\nnever find it if he lived beside it a thousand years; would have\r\ndestroyed it if he had found it, as Herod slew the innocents, as\r\nRome slew the martyrs.\r\n\r\nSAN--CTA MARI-I-I-A,\r\n\r\nwailed Raoul from the organ loft;\r\n\r\nO--RA PRO NO-O-BIS!\r\n\r\nAnd it did not occur to Emil that any one had ever reasoned thus\r\nbefore, that music had ever before given a man this equivocal\r\nrevelation.\r\n\r\nThe confirmation service followed the Mass. When it was over, the\r\ncongregation thronged about the newly confirmed. The girls, and\r\neven the boys, were kissed and embraced and wept over. All the\r\naunts and grandmothers wept with joy. The housewives had much ado\r\nto tear themselves away from the general rejoicing and hurry back\r\nto their kitchens. The country parishioners were staying in town\r\nfor dinner, and nearly every house in Sainte-Agnes entertained\r\nvisitors that day. Father Duchesne, the bishop, and the visiting\r\npriests dined with Fabien Sauvage, the banker. Emil and Frank\r\nShabata were both guests of old Moise Marcel. After dinner Frank\r\nand old Moise retired to the rear room of the saloon to play\r\nCalifornia Jack and drink their cognac, and Emil went over to the\r\nbanker's with Raoul, who had been asked to sing for the bishop.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock, Emil felt that he could stand it no longer. He\r\nslipped out under cover of \"The Holy City,\" followed by Malvina's\r\nwistful eye, and went to the stable for his mare. He was at that\r\nheight of excitement from which everything is foreshortened, from\r\nwhich life seems short and simple, death very near, and the soul\r\nseems to soar like an eagle. As he rode past the graveyard he looked\r\nat the brown hole in the earth where Amedee was to lie, and felt\r\nno horror. That, too, was beautiful, that simple doorway into\r\nforgetfulness. The heart, when it is too much alive, aches for\r\nthat brown earth, and ecstasy has no fear of death. It is the old\r\nand the poor and the maimed who shrink from that brown hole; its\r\nwooers are found among the young, the passionate, the gallant-hearted.\r\nIt was not until he had passed the graveyard that Emil realized\r\nwhere he was going. It was the hour for saying good-bye. It might\r\nbe the last time that he would see her alone, and today he could\r\nleave her without rancor, without bitterness.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the grain stood ripe and the hot afternoon was full of\r\nthe smell of the ripe wheat, like the smell of bread baking in an\r\noven. The breath of the wheat and the sweet clover passed him like\r\npleasant things in a dream. He could feel nothing but the sense of\r\ndiminishing distance. It seemed to him that his mare was flying,\r\nor running on wheels, like a railway train. The sunlight, flashing\r\non the window-glass of the big red barns, drove him wild with joy.\r\nHe was like an arrow shot from the bow. His life poured itself\r\nout along the road before him as he rode to the Shabata farm.\r\n\r\nWhen Emil alighted at the Shabatas' gate, his horse was in a lather.\r\nHe tied her in the stable and hurried to the house. It was empty.\r\nShe might be at Mrs. Hiller's or with Alexandra. But anything\r\nthat reminded him of her would be enough, the orchard, the mulberry\r\ntree... When he reached the orchard the sun was hanging low over\r\nthe wheatfield. Long fingers of light reached through the apple\r\nbranches as through a net; the orchard was riddled and shot with\r\ngold; light was the reality, the trees were merely interferences\r\nthat reflected and refracted light. Emil went softly down between\r\nthe cherry trees toward the wheatfield. When he came to the corner,\r\nhe stopped short and put his hand over his mouth. Marie was lying\r\non her side under the white mulberry tree, her face half hidden in\r\nthe grass, her eyes closed, her hands lying limply where they had\r\nhappened to fall. She had lived a day of her new life of perfect\r\nlove, and it had left her like this. Her breast rose and fell\r\nfaintly, as if she were asleep. Emil threw himself down beside\r\nher and took her in his arms. The blood came back to her cheeks,\r\nher amber eyes opened slowly, and in them Emil saw his own face\r\nand the orchard and the sun. \"I was dreaming this,\" she whispered,\r\nhiding her face against him, \"don't take my dream away!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nWhen Frank Shabata got home that night, he found Emil's mare in\r\nhis stable. Such an impertinence amazed him. Like everybody else,\r\nFrank had had an exciting day. Since noon he had been drinking too\r\nmuch, and he was in a bad temper. He talked bitterly to himself\r\nwhile he put his own horse away, and as he went up the path and\r\nsaw that the house was dark he felt an added sense of injury. He\r\napproached quietly and listened on the doorstep. Hearing nothing,\r\nhe opened the kitchen door and went softly from one room to another.\r\nThen he went through the house again, upstairs and down, with no\r\nbetter result. He sat down on the bottom step of the box stairway\r\nand tried to get his wits together. In that unnatural quiet there\r\nwas no sound but his own heavy breathing. Suddenly an owl began\r\nto hoot out in the fields. Frank lifted his head. An idea flashed\r\ninto his mind, and his sense of injury and outrage grew. He went\r\ninto his bedroom and took his murderous 405 Winchester from the\r\ncloset.\r\n\r\nWhen Frank took up his gun and walked out of the house, he had not\r\nthe faintest purpose of doing anything with it. He did not believe\r\nthat he had any real grievance. But it gratified him to feel like\r\na desperate man. He had got into the habit of seeing himself always\r\nin desperate straits. His unhappy temperament was like a cage; he\r\ncould never get out of it; and he felt that other people, his wife\r\nin particular, must have put him there. It had never more than\r\ndimly occurred to Frank that he made his own unhappiness. Though\r\nhe took up his gun with dark projects in his mind, he would have\r\nbeen paralyzed with fright had he known that there was the slightest\r\nprobability of his ever carrying any of them out.\r\n\r\nFrank went slowly down to the orchard gate, stopped and stood for\r\na moment lost in thought. He retraced his steps and looked through\r\nthe barn and the hayloft. Then he went out to the road, where he\r\ntook the foot-path along the outside of the orchard hedge. The\r\nhedge was twice as tall as Frank himself, and so dense that one\r\ncould see through it only by peering closely between the leaves.\r\nHe could see the empty path a long way in the moonlight. His mind\r\ntraveled ahead to the stile, which he always thought of as haunted\r\nby Emil Bergson. But why had he left his horse?\r\n\r\nAt the wheatfield corner, where the orchard hedge ended and the\r\npath led across the pasture to the Bergsons', Frank stopped. In\r\nthe warm, breathless night air he heard a murmuring sound, perfectly\r\ninarticulate, as low as the sound of water coming from a spring,\r\nwhere there is no fall, and where there are no stones to fret it.\r\nFrank strained his ears. It ceased. He held his breath and began\r\nto tremble. Resting the butt of his gun on the ground, he parted\r\nthe mulberry leaves softly with his fingers and peered through\r\nthe hedge at the dark figures on the grass, in the shadow of the\r\nmulberry tree. It seemed to him that they must feel his eyes,\r\nthat they must hear him breathing. But they did not. Frank, who\r\nhad always wanted to see things blacker than they were, for once\r\nwanted to believe less than he saw. The woman lying in the shadow\r\nmight so easily be one of the Bergsons' farm-girls.... Again\r\nthe murmur, like water welling out of the ground. This time he\r\nheard it more distinctly, and his blood was quicker than his brain.\r\nHe began to act, just as a man who falls into the fire begins to\r\nact. The gun sprang to his shoulder, he sighted mechanically and\r\nfired three times without stopping, stopped without knowing why.\r\nEither he shut his eyes or he had vertigo. He did not see anything\r\nwhile he was firing. He thought he heard a cry simultaneous with\r\nthe second report, but he was not sure. He peered again through\r\nthe hedge, at the two dark figures under the tree. They had fallen\r\na little apart from each other, and were perfectly still--No,\r\nnot quite; in a white patch of light, where the moon shone through\r\nthe branches, a man's hand was plucking spasmodically at the grass.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the woman stirred and uttered a cry, then another, and\r\nanother. She was living! She was dragging herself toward the\r\nhedge! Frank dropped his gun and ran back along the path, shaking,\r\nstumbling, gasping. He had never imagined such horror. The\r\ncries followed him. They grew fainter and thicker, as if she were\r\nchoking. He dropped on his knees beside the hedge and crouched\r\nlike a rabbit, listening; fainter, fainter; a sound like a whine;\r\nagain--a moan--another--silence. Frank scrambled to his feet and\r\nran on, groaning and praying. From habit he went toward the house,\r\nwhere he was used to being soothed when he had worked himself into\r\na frenzy, but at the sight of the black, open door, he started back.\r\nHe knew that he had murdered somebody, that a woman was bleeding\r\nand moaning in the orchard, but he had not realized before that\r\nit was his wife. The gate stared him in the face. He threw his\r\nhands over his head. Which way to turn? He lifted his tormented\r\nface and looked at the sky. \"Holy Mother of God, not to suffer!\r\nShe was a good girl--not to suffer!\"\r\n\r\nFrank had been wont to see himself in dramatic situations; but\r\nnow, when he stood by the windmill, in the bright space between the\r\nbarn and the house, facing his own black doorway, he did not see\r\nhimself at all. He stood like the hare when the dogs are approaching\r\nfrom all sides. And he ran like a hare, back and forth about that\r\nmoonlit space, before he could make up his mind to go into the\r\ndark stable for a horse. The thought of going into a doorway was\r\nterrible to him. He caught Emil's horse by the bit and led it out.\r\nHe could not have buckled a bridle on his own. After two or three\r\nattempts, he lifted himself into the saddle and started for Hanover.\r\nIf he could catch the one o'clock train, he had money enough to\r\nget as far as Omaha.\r\n\r\nWhile he was thinking dully of this in some less sensitized part\r\nof his brain, his acuter faculties were going over and over the\r\ncries he had heard in the orchard. Terror was the only thing that\r\nkept him from going back to her, terror that she might still be\r\nshe, that she might still be suffering. A woman, mutilated and\r\nbleeding in his orchard--it was because it was a woman that he\r\nwas so afraid. It was inconceivable that he should have hurt a\r\nwoman. He would rather be eaten by wild beasts than see her move\r\non the ground as she had moved in the orchard. Why had she been\r\nso careless? She knew he was like a crazy man when he was angry.\r\nShe had more than once taken that gun away from him and held it,\r\nwhen he was angry with other people. Once it had gone off while\r\nthey were struggling over it. She was never afraid. But, when\r\nshe knew him, why hadn't she been more careful? Didn't she have\r\nall summer before her to love Emil Bergson in, without taking such\r\nchances? Probably she had met the Smirka boy, too, down there in\r\nthe orchard. He didn't care. She could have met all the men on the\r\nDivide there, and welcome, if only she hadn't brought this horror\r\non him.\r\n\r\nThere was a wrench in Frank's mind. He did not honestly believe that\r\nof her. He knew that he was doing her wrong. He stopped his horse\r\nto admit this to himself the more directly, to think it out the more\r\nclearly. He knew that he was to blame. For three years he had been\r\ntrying to break her spirit. She had a way of making the best of\r\nthings that seemed to him a sentimental affectation. He wanted his\r\nwife to resent that he was wasting his best years among these stupid\r\nand unappreciative people; but she had seemed to find the people\r\nquite good enough. If he ever got rich he meant to buy her pretty\r\nclothes and take her to California in a Pullman car, and treat her\r\nlike a lady; but in the mean time he wanted her to feel that life was\r\nas ugly and as unjust as he felt it. He had tried to make her life\r\nugly. He had refused to share any of the little pleasures she was so\r\nplucky about making for herself. She could be gay about the least\r\nthing in the world; but she must be gay! When she first came to him,\r\nher faith in him, her adoration--Frank struck the mare with his fist.\r\nWhy had Marie made him do this thing; why had she brought this upon\r\nhim? He was overwhelmed by sickening misfortune. All at once he\r\nheard her cries again--he had forgotten for a moment. \"Maria,\" he\r\nsobbed aloud, \"Maria!\"\r\n\r\nWhen Frank was halfway to Hanover, the motion of his horse brought\r\non a violent attack of nausea. After it had passed, he rode on\r\nagain, but he could think of nothing except his physical weakness\r\nand his desire to be comforted by his wife. He wanted to get into\r\nhis own bed. Had his wife been at home, he would have turned and\r\ngone back to her meekly enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nWhen old Ivar climbed down from his loft at four o'clock the next\r\nmorning, he came upon Emil's mare, jaded and lather-stained, her\r\nbridle broken, chewing the scattered tufts of hay outside the stable\r\ndoor. The old man was thrown into a fright at once. He put the\r\nmare in her stall, threw her a measure of oats, and then set out\r\nas fast as his bow-legs could carry him on the path to the nearest\r\nneighbor.\r\n\r\n\"Something is wrong with that boy. Some misfortune has come upon\r\nus. He would never have used her so, in his right senses. It is\r\nnot his way to abuse his mare,\" the old man kept muttering, as he\r\nscuttled through the short, wet pasture grass on his bare feet.\r\n\r\nWhile Ivar was hurrying across the fields, the first long rays of\r\nthe sun were reaching down between the orchard boughs to those two\r\ndew-drenched figures. The story of what had happened was written\r\nplainly on the orchard grass, and on the white mulberries that had\r\nfallen in the night and were covered with dark stain. For Emil the\r\nchapter had been short. He was shot in the heart, and had rolled\r\nover on his back and died. His face was turned up to the sky and\r\nhis brows were drawn in a frown, as if he had realized that something\r\nhad befallen him. But for Marie Shabata it had not been so easy.\r\nOne ball had torn through her right lung, another had shattered\r\nthe carotid artery. She must have started up and gone toward the\r\nhedge, leaving a trail of blood. There she had fallen and bled.\r\nFrom that spot there was another trail, heavier than the first,\r\nwhere she must have dragged herself back to Emil's body. Once\r\nthere, she seemed not to have struggled any more. She had lifted\r\nher head to her lover's breast, taken his hand in both her own,\r\nand bled quietly to death. She was lying on her right side in an\r\neasy and natural position, her cheek on Emil's shoulder. On her\r\nface there was a look of ineffable content. Her lips were parted\r\na little; her eyes were lightly closed, as if in a day-dream or a\r\nlight slumber. After she lay down there, she seemed not to have\r\nmoved an eyelash. The hand she held was covered with dark stains,\r\nwhere she had kissed it.\r\n\r\nBut the stained, slippery grass, the darkened mulberries, told only\r\nhalf the story. Above Marie and Emil, two white butterflies from\r\nFrank's alfalfa-field were fluttering in and out among the interlacing\r\nshadows; diving and soaring, now close together, now far apart;\r\nand in the long grass by the fence the last wild roses of the year\r\nopened their pink hearts to die.\r\n\r\nWhen Ivar reached the path by the hedge, he saw Shabata's rifle\r\nlying in the way. He turned and peered through the branches,\r\nfalling upon his knees as if his legs had been mowed from under\r\nhim. \"Merciful God!\" he groaned.\r\n\r\nAlexandra, too, had risen early that morning, because of her anxiety\r\nabout Emil. She was in Emil's room upstairs when, from the window,\r\nshe saw Ivar coming along the path that led from the Shabatas'.\r\nHe was running like a spent man, tottering and lurching from side\r\nto side. Ivar never drank, and Alexandra thought at once that one\r\nof his spells had come upon him, and that he must be in a very bad\r\nway indeed. She ran downstairs and hurried out to meet him, to\r\nhide his infirmity from the eyes of her household. The old man\r\nfell in the road at her feet and caught her hand, over which he\r\nbowed his shaggy head. \"Mistress, mistress,\" he sobbed, \"it has\r\nfallen! Sin and death for the young ones! God have mercy upon\r\nus!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V. Alexandra\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIvar was sitting at a cobbler's bench in the barn, mending harness\r\nby the light of a lantern and repeating to himself the 101st Psalm.\r\nIt was only five o'clock of a mid-October day, but a storm had\r\ncome up in the afternoon, bringing black clouds, a cold wind and\r\ntorrents of rain. The old man wore his buffalo-skin coat, and\r\noccasionally stopped to warm his fingers at the lantern. Suddenly\r\na woman burst into the shed, as if she had been blown in, accompanied by\r\na shower of rain-drops. It was Signa, wrapped in a man's overcoat\r\nand wearing a pair of boots over her shoes. In time of trouble\r\nSigna had come back to stay with her mistress, for she was the only\r\none of the maids from whom Alexandra would accept much personal\r\nservice. It was three months now since the news of the terrible\r\nthing that had happened in Frank Shabata's orchard had first run\r\nlike a fire over the Divide. Signa and Nelse were staying on with\r\nAlexandra until winter.\r\n\r\n\"Ivar,\" Signa exclaimed as she wiped the rain from her face, \"do\r\nyou know where she is?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man put down his cobbler's knife. \"Who, the mistress?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. She went away about three o'clock. I happened to look out\r\nof the window and saw her going across the fields in her thin dress\r\nand sun-hat. And now this storm has come on. I thought she was\r\ngoing to Mrs. Hiller's, and I telephoned as soon as the thunder\r\nstopped, but she had not been there. I'm afraid she is out somewhere\r\nand will get her death of cold.\"\r\n\r\nIvar put on his cap and took up the lantern. \"JA, JA, we will see.\r\nI will hitch the boy's mare to the cart and go.\"\r\n\r\nSigna followed him across the wagon-shed to the horses' stable.\r\nShe was shivering with cold and excitement. \"Where do you suppose\r\nshe can be, Ivar?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man lifted a set of single harness carefully from its peg.\r\n\"How should I know?\"\r\n\r\n\"But you think she is at the graveyard, don't you?\" Signa persisted.\r\n\"So do I. Oh, I wish she would be more like herself! I can't\r\nbelieve it's Alexandra Bergson come to this, with no head about\r\nanything. I have to tell her when to eat and when to go to bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Patience, patience, sister,\" muttered Ivar as he settled the bit\r\nin the horse's mouth. \"When the eyes of the flesh are shut, the\r\neyes of the spirit are open. She will have a message from those\r\nwho are gone, and that will bring her peace. Until then we must\r\nbear with her. You and I are the only ones who have weight with\r\nher. She trusts us.\"\r\n\r\n\"How awful it's been these last three months.\" Signa held the\r\nlantern so that he could see to buckle the straps. \"It don't seem\r\nright that we must all be so miserable. Why do we all have to be\r\npunished? Seems to me like good times would never come again.\"\r\n\r\nIvar expressed himself in a deep sigh, but said nothing. He stooped\r\nand took a sandburr from his toe.\r\n\r\n\"Ivar,\" Signa asked suddenly, \"will you tell me why you go barefoot?\r\nAll the time I lived here in the house I wanted to ask you. Is it\r\nfor a penance, or what?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sister. It is for the indulgence of the body. From my youth\r\nup I have had a strong, rebellious body, and have been subject to\r\nevery kind of temptation. Even in age my temptations are prolonged.\r\nIt was necessary to make some allowances; and the feet, as I\r\nunderstand it, are free members. There is no divine prohibition\r\nfor them in the Ten Commandments. The hands, the tongue, the eyes,\r\nthe heart, all the bodily desires we are commanded to subdue; but\r\nthe feet are free members. I indulge them without harm to any\r\none, even to trampling in filth when my desires are low. They are\r\nquickly cleaned again.\"\r\n\r\nSigna did not laugh. She looked thoughtful as she followed Ivar out\r\nto the wagon-shed and held the shafts up for him, while he backed\r\nin the mare and buckled the hold-backs. \"You have been a good\r\nfriend to the mistress, Ivar,\" she murmured.\r\n\r\n\"And you, God be with you,\" replied Ivar as he clambered into the\r\ncart and put the lantern under the oilcloth lap-cover. \"Now for\r\na ducking, my girl,\" he said to the mare, gathering up the reins.\r\n\r\nAs they emerged from the shed, a stream of water, running off the\r\nthatch, struck the mare on the neck. She tossed her head indignantly,\r\nthen struck out bravely on the soft ground, slipping back again and\r\nagain as she climbed the hill to the main road. Between the rain\r\nand the darkness Ivar could see very little, so he let Emil's mare\r\nhave the rein, keeping her head in the right direction. When the\r\nground was level, he turned her out of the dirt road upon the sod,\r\nwhere she was able to trot without slipping.\r\n\r\nBefore Ivar reached the graveyard, three miles from the house,\r\nthe storm had spent itself, and the downpour had died into a soft,\r\ndripping rain. The sky and the land were a dark smoke color, and\r\nseemed to be coming together, like two waves. When Ivar stopped\r\nat the gate and swung out his lantern, a white figure rose from\r\nbeside John Bergson's white stone.\r\n\r\nThe old man sprang to the ground and shuffled toward the gate\r\ncalling, \"Mistress, mistress!\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra hurried to meet him and put her hand on his shoulder.\r\n\"TYST! Ivar. There's nothing to be worried about. I'm sorry if\r\nI've scared you all. I didn't notice the storm till it was on me,\r\nand I couldn't walk against it. I'm glad you've come. I am so\r\ntired I didn't know how I'd ever get home.\"\r\n\r\nIvar swung the lantern up so that it shone in her face. \"GUD!\r\nYou are enough to frighten us, mistress. You look like a drowned\r\nwoman. How could you do such a thing!\"\r\n\r\nGroaning and mumbling he led her out of the gate and helped her\r\ninto the cart, wrapping her in the dry blankets on which he had\r\nbeen sitting.\r\n\r\nAlexandra smiled at his solicitude. \"Not much use in that, Ivar.\r\nYou will only shut the wet in. I don't feel so cold now; but I'm\r\nheavy and numb. I'm glad you came.\"\r\n\r\nIvar turned the mare and urged her into a sliding trot. Her feet\r\nsent back a continual spatter of mud.\r\n\r\nAlexandra spoke to the old man as they jogged along through the\r\nsullen gray twilight of the storm. \"Ivar, I think it has done me\r\ngood to get cold clear through like this, once. I don't believe\r\nI shall suffer so much any more. When you get so near the dead,\r\nthey seem more real than the living. Worldly thoughts leave one.\r\nEver since Emil died, I've suffered so when it rained. Now that\r\nI've been out in it with him, I shan't dread it. After you once\r\nget cold clear through, the feeling of the rain on you is sweet.\r\nIt seems to bring back feelings you had when you were a baby. It\r\ncarries you back into the dark, before you were born; you can't\r\nsee things, but they come to you, somehow, and you know them and\r\naren't afraid of them. Maybe it's like that with the dead. If\r\nthey feel anything at all, it's the old things, before they were\r\nborn, that comfort people like the feeling of their own bed does\r\nwhen they are little.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mistress,\" said Ivar reproachfully, \"those are bad thoughts. The\r\ndead are in Paradise.\"\r\n\r\nThen he hung his head, for he did not believe that Emil was in\r\nParadise.\r\n\r\nWhen they got home, Signa had a fire burning in the sitting-room\r\nstove. She undressed Alexandra and gave her a hot footbath, while\r\nIvar made ginger tea in the kitchen. When Alexandra was in bed,\r\nwrapped in hot blankets, Ivar came in with his tea and saw that\r\nshe drank it. Signa asked permission to sleep on the slat lounge\r\noutside her door. Alexandra endured their attentions patiently,\r\nbut she was glad when they put out the lamp and left her. As she\r\nlay alone in the dark, it occurred to her for the first time that\r\nperhaps she was actually tired of life. All the physical operations\r\nof life seemed difficult and painful. She longed to be free from\r\nher own body, which ached and was so heavy. And longing itself\r\nwas heavy: she yearned to be free of that.\r\n\r\nAs she lay with her eyes closed, she had again, more vividly than\r\nfor many years, the old illusion of her girlhood, of being lifted\r\nand carried lightly by some one very strong. He was with her\r\na long while this time, and carried her very far, and in his arms\r\nshe felt free from pain. When he laid her down on her bed again,\r\nshe opened her eyes, and, for the first time in her life, she saw\r\nhim, saw him clearly, though the room was dark, and his face was\r\ncovered. He was standing in the doorway of her room. His white\r\ncloak was thrown over his face, and his head was bent a little\r\nforward. His shoulders seemed as strong as the foundations of the\r\nworld. His right arm, bared from the elbow, was dark and gleaming,\r\nlike bronze, and she knew at once that it was the arm of the\r\nmightiest of all lovers. She knew at last for whom it was she had\r\nwaited, and where he would carry her. That, she told herself, was\r\nvery well. Then she went to sleep.\r\n\r\nAlexandra wakened in the morning with nothing worse than a hard cold\r\nand a stiff shoulder. She kept her bed for several days, and it\r\nwas during that time that she formed a resolution to go to Lincoln\r\nto see Frank Shabata. Ever since she last saw him in the courtroom,\r\nFrank's haggard face and wild eyes had haunted her. The trial had\r\nlasted only three days. Frank had given himself up to the police\r\nin Omaha and pleaded guilty of killing without malice and without\r\npremeditation. The gun was, of course, against him, and the judge\r\nhad given him the full sentence,--ten years. He had now been in\r\nthe State Penitentiary for a month.\r\n\r\nFrank was the only one, Alexandra told herself, for whom anything\r\ncould be done. He had been less in the wrong than any of them,\r\nand he was paying the heaviest penalty. She often felt that she\r\nherself had been more to blame than poor Frank. From the time the\r\nShabatas had first moved to the neighboring farm, she had omitted\r\nno opportunity of throwing Marie and Emil together. Because she\r\nknew Frank was surly about doing little things to help his wife,\r\nshe was always sending Emil over to spade or plant or carpenter\r\nfor Marie. She was glad to have Emil see as much as possible of an\r\nintelligent, city-bred girl like their neighbor; she noticed that\r\nit improved his manners. She knew that Emil was fond of Marie, but\r\nit had never occurred to her that Emil's feeling might be different\r\nfrom her own. She wondered at herself now, but she had never\r\nthought of danger in that direction. If Marie had been unmarried,--oh,\r\nyes! Then she would have kept her eyes open. But the mere fact that\r\nshe was Shabata's wife, for Alexandra, settled everything. That she was\r\nbeautiful, impulsive, barely two years older than Emil, these facts had\r\nhad no weight with Alexandra. Emil was a good boy, and only bad boys\r\nran after married women.\r\n\r\nNow, Alexandra could in a measure realize that Marie was, after\r\nall, Marie; not merely a \"married woman.\" Sometimes, when Alexandra\r\nthought of her, it was with an aching tenderness. The moment she\r\nhad reached them in the orchard that morning, everything was clear\r\nto her. There was something about those two lying in the grass,\r\nsomething in the way Marie had settled her cheek on Emil's shoulder,\r\nthat told her everything. She wondered then how they could have\r\nhelped loving each other; how she could have helped knowing that\r\nthey must. Emil's cold, frowning face, the girl's content--Alexandra\r\nhad felt awe of them, even in the first shock of her grief.\r\n\r\nThe idleness of those days in bed, the relaxation of body which\r\nattended them, enabled Alexandra to think more calmly than she had\r\ndone since Emil's death. She and Frank, she told herself, were left\r\nout of that group of friends who had been overwhelmed by disaster.\r\nShe must certainly see Frank Shabata. Even in the courtroom her\r\nheart had grieved for him. He was in a strange country, he had no\r\nkinsmen or friends, and in a moment he had ruined his life. Being\r\nwhat he was, she felt, Frank could not have acted otherwise. She\r\ncould understand his behavior more easily than she could understand\r\nMarie's. Yes, she must go to Lincoln to see Frank Shabata.\r\n\r\nThe day after Emil's funeral, Alexandra had written to Carl Linstrum;\r\na single page of notepaper, a bare statement of what had happened.\r\nShe was not a woman who could write much about such a thing, and\r\nabout her own feelings she could never write very freely. She knew\r\nthat Carl was away from post-offices, prospecting somewhere in the\r\ninterior. Before he started he had written her where he expected\r\nto go, but her ideas about Alaska were vague. As the weeks went\r\nby and she heard nothing from him, it seemed to Alexandra that\r\nher heart grew hard against Carl. She began to wonder whether she\r\nwould not do better to finish her life alone. What was left of\r\nlife seemed unimportant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon of a brilliant October day, Alexandra Bergson,\r\ndressed in a black suit and traveling-hat, alighted at the Burlington\r\ndepot in Lincoln. She drove to the Lindell Hotel, where she had\r\nstayed two years ago when she came up for Emil's Commencement. In\r\nspite of her usual air of sureness and self-possession, Alexandra\r\nfelt ill at ease in hotels, and she was glad, when she went to the\r\nclerk's desk to register, that there were not many people in the\r\nlobby. She had her supper early, wearing her hat and black jacket\r\ndown to the dining-room and carrying her handbag. After supper\r\nshe went out for a walk.\r\n\r\nIt was growing dark when she reached the university campus. She\r\ndid not go into the grounds, but walked slowly up and down the\r\nstone walk outside the long iron fence, looking through at the young\r\nmen who were running from one building to another, at the lights\r\nshining from the armory and the library. A squad of cadets were\r\ngoing through their drill behind the armory, and the commands of\r\ntheir young officer rang out at regular intervals, so sharp and\r\nquick that Alexandra could not understand them. Two stalwart girls\r\ncame down the library steps and out through one of the iron gates.\r\nAs they passed her, Alexandra was pleased to hear them speaking\r\nBohemian to each other. Every few moments a boy would come running\r\ndown the flagged walk and dash out into the street as if he were\r\nrushing to announce some wonder to the world. Alexandra felt a\r\ngreat tenderness for them all. She wished one of them would stop\r\nand speak to her. She wished she could ask them whether they had\r\nknown Emil.\r\n\r\nAs she lingered by the south gate she actually did encounter one\r\nof the boys. He had on his drill cap and was swinging his books\r\nat the end of a long strap. It was dark by this time; he did not\r\nsee her and ran against her. He snatched off his cap and stood\r\nbareheaded and panting. \"I'm awfully sorry,\" he said in a bright,\r\nclear voice, with a rising inflection, as if he expected her to\r\nsay something.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it was my fault!\" said Alexandra eagerly. \"Are you an old\r\nstudent here, may I ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, ma'am. I'm a Freshie, just off the farm. Cherry County.\r\nWere you hunting somebody?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you. That is--\" Alexandra wanted to detain him. \"That\r\nis, I would like to find some of my brother's friends. He graduated\r\ntwo years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you'd have to try the Seniors, wouldn't you? Let's see; I\r\ndon't know any of them yet, but there'll be sure to be some of them\r\naround the library. That red building, right there,\" he pointed.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, I'll try there,\" said Alexandra lingeringly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's all right! Good-night.\" The lad clapped his cap on\r\nhis head and ran straight down Eleventh Street. Alexandra looked\r\nafter him wistfully.\r\n\r\nShe walked back to her hotel unreasonably comforted. \"What a nice\r\nvoice that boy had, and how polite he was. I know Emil was always\r\nlike that to women.\" And again, after she had undressed and was\r\nstanding in her nightgown, brushing her long, heavy hair by the\r\nelectric light, she remembered him and said to herself, \"I don't\r\nthink I ever heard a nicer voice than that boy had. I hope he\r\nwill get on well here. Cherry County; that's where the hay is so\r\nfine, and the coyotes can scratch down to water.\"\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock the next morning Alexandra presented herself\r\nat the warden's office in the State Penitentiary. The warden was\r\na German, a ruddy, cheerful-looking man who had formerly been a\r\nharness-maker. Alexandra had a letter to him from the German banker\r\nin Hanover. As he glanced at the letter, Mr. Schwartz put away\r\nhis pipe.\r\n\r\n\"That big Bohemian, is it? Sure, he's gettin' along fine,\" said\r\nMr. Schwartz cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to hear that. I was afraid he might be quarrelsome and\r\nget himself into more trouble. Mr. Schwartz, if you have time, I\r\nwould like to tell you a little about Frank Shabata, and why I am\r\ninterested in him.\"\r\n\r\nThe warden listened genially while she told him briefly something\r\nof Frank's history and character, but he did not seem to find\r\nanything unusual in her account.\r\n\r\n\"Sure, I'll keep an eye on him. We'll take care of him all right,\"\r\nhe said, rising. \"You can talk to him here, while I go to see to\r\nthings in the kitchen. I'll have him sent in. He ought to be done\r\nwashing out his cell by this time. We have to keep 'em clean, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nThe warden paused at the door, speaking back over his shoulder to\r\na pale young man in convicts' clothes who was seated at a desk in\r\nthe corner, writing in a big ledger.\r\n\r\n\"Bertie, when 1037 is brought in, you just step out and give this\r\nlady a chance to talk.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man bowed his head and bent over his ledger again.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Schwartz disappeared, Alexandra thrust her black-edged\r\nhandkerchief nervously into her handbag. Coming out on the streetcar\r\nshe had not had the least dread of meeting Frank. But since she\r\nhad been here the sounds and smells in the corridor, the look of the\r\nmen in convicts' clothes who passed the glass door of the warden's\r\noffice, affected her unpleasantly.\r\n\r\nThe warden's clock ticked, the young convict's pen scratched\r\nbusily in the big book, and his sharp shoulders were shaken every\r\nfew seconds by a loose cough which he tried to smother. It was easy\r\nto see that he was a sick man. Alexandra looked at him timidly,\r\nbut he did not once raise his eyes. He wore a white shirt under\r\nhis striped jacket, a high collar, and a necktie, very carefully\r\ntied. His hands were thin and white and well cared for, and he had\r\na seal ring on his little finger. When he heard steps approaching\r\nin the corridor, he rose, blotted his book, put his pen in the rack,\r\nand left the room without raising his eyes. Through the door he\r\nopened a guard came in, bringing Frank Shabata.\r\n\r\n\"You the lady that wanted to talk to 1037? Here he is. Be on your\r\ngood behavior, now. He can set down, lady,\" seeing that Alexandra\r\nremained standing. \"Push that white button when you're through\r\nwith him, and I'll come.\"\r\n\r\nThe guard went out and Alexandra and Frank were left alone.\r\n\r\nAlexandra tried not to see his hideous clothes. She tried to look\r\nstraight into his face, which she could scarcely believe was his.\r\nIt was already bleached to a chalky gray. His lips were colorless,\r\nhis fine teeth looked yellowish. He glanced at Alexandra sullenly,\r\nblinked as if he had come from a dark place, and one eyebrow twitched\r\ncontinually. She felt at once that this interview was a terrible\r\nordeal to him. His shaved head, showing the conformation of his\r\nskull, gave him a criminal look which he had not had during the\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nAlexandra held out her hand. \"Frank,\" she said, her eyes filling\r\nsuddenly, \"I hope you'll let me be friendly with you. I understand\r\nhow you did it. I don't feel hard toward you. They were more to\r\nblame than you.\"\r\n\r\nFrank jerked a dirty blue handkerchief from his trousers pocket.\r\nHe had begun to cry. He turned away from Alexandra. \"I never\r\ndid mean to do not'ing to dat woman,\" he muttered. \"I never mean\r\nto do not'ing to dat boy. I ain't had not'ing ag'in' dat boy. I\r\nalways like dat boy fine. An' then I find him--\" He stopped. The\r\nfeeling went out of his face and eyes. He dropped into a chair\r\nand sat looking stolidly at the floor, his hands hanging loosely\r\nbetween his knees, the handkerchief lying across his striped leg.\r\nHe seemed to have stirred up in his mind a disgust that had paralyzed\r\nhis faculties.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't come up here to blame you, Frank. I think they were\r\nmore to blame than you.\" Alexandra, too, felt benumbed.\r\n\r\nFrank looked up suddenly and stared out of the office window. \"I\r\nguess dat place all go to hell what I work so hard on,\" he said\r\nwith a slow, bitter smile. \"I not care a damn.\" He stopped and\r\nrubbed the palm of his hand over the light bristles on his head\r\nwith annoyance. \"I no can t'ink without my hair,\" he complained.\r\n\"I forget English. We not talk here, except swear.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra was bewildered. Frank seemed to have undergone a change\r\nof personality. There was scarcely anything by which she could\r\nrecognize her handsome Bohemian neighbor. He seemed, somehow, not\r\naltogether human. She did not know what to say to him.\r\n\r\n\"You do not feel hard to me, Frank?\" she asked at last.\r\n\r\nFrank clenched his fist and broke out in excitement. \"I not feel\r\nhard at no woman. I tell you I not that kind-a man. I never hit\r\nmy wife. No, never I hurt her when she devil me something awful!\"\r\nHe struck his fist down on the warden's desk so hard that he\r\nafterward stroked it absently. A pale pink crept over his neck and\r\nface. \"Two, t'ree years I know dat woman don' care no more 'bout\r\nme, Alexandra Bergson. I know she after some other man. I know\r\nher, oo-oo! An' I ain't never hurt her. I never would-a done\r\ndat, if I ain't had dat gun along. I don' know what in hell make\r\nme take dat gun. She always say I ain't no man to carry gun. If\r\nshe been in dat house, where she ought-a been--But das a foolish\r\ntalk.\"\r\n\r\nFrank rubbed his head and stopped suddenly, as he had stopped\r\nbefore. Alexandra felt that there was something strange in the way\r\nhe chilled off, as if something came up in him that extinguished\r\nhis power of feeling or thinking.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Frank,\" she said kindly. \"I know you never meant to hurt\r\nMarie.\"\r\n\r\nFrank smiled at her queerly. His eyes filled slowly with tears.\r\n\"You know, I most forgit dat woman's name. She ain't got no name\r\nfor me no more. I never hate my wife, but dat woman what make me\r\ndo dat--Honest to God, but I hate her! I no man to fight. I\r\ndon' want to kill no boy and no woman. I not care how many men\r\nshe take under dat tree. I no care for not'ing but dat fine boy\r\nI kill, Alexandra Bergson. I guess I go crazy sure 'nough.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra remembered the little yellow cane she had found in Frank's\r\nclothes-closet. She thought of how he had come to this country a\r\ngay young fellow, so attractive that the prettiest Bohemian girl\r\nin Omaha had run away with him. It seemed unreasonable that life\r\nshould have landed him in such a place as this. She blamed Marie\r\nbitterly. And why, with her happy, affectionate nature, should\r\nshe have brought destruction and sorrow to all who had loved her,\r\neven to poor old Joe Tovesky, the uncle who used to carry her about\r\nso proudly when she was a little girl? That was the strangest thing\r\nof all. Was there, then, something wrong in being warm-hearted\r\nand impulsive like that? Alexandra hated to think so. But there\r\nwas Emil, in the Norwegian graveyard at home, and here was Frank\r\nShabata. Alexandra rose and took him by the hand.\r\n\r\n\"Frank Shabata, I am never going to stop trying until I get you\r\npardoned. I'll never give the Governor any peace. I know I can\r\nget you out of this place.\"\r\n\r\nFrank looked at her distrustfully, but he gathered confidence from\r\nher face. \"Alexandra,\" he said earnestly, \"if I git out-a here,\r\nI not trouble dis country no more. I go back where I come from;\r\nsee my mother.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra tried to withdraw her hand, but Frank held on to it\r\nnervously. He put out his finger and absently touched a button\r\non her black jacket. \"Alexandra,\" he said in a low tone, looking\r\nsteadily at the button, \"you ain' t'ink I use dat girl awful bad\r\nbefore--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Frank. We won't talk about that,\" Alexandra said, pressing\r\nhis hand. \"I can't help Emil now, so I'm going to do what I can\r\nfor you. You know I don't go away from home often, and I came up\r\nhere on purpose to tell you this.\"\r\n\r\nThe warden at the glass door looked in inquiringly. Alexandra\r\nnodded, and he came in and touched the white button on his desk.\r\nThe guard appeared, and with a sinking heart Alexandra saw Frank\r\nled away down the corridor. After a few words with Mr. Schwartz,\r\nshe left the prison and made her way to the street-car. She had\r\nrefused with horror the warden's cordial invitation to \"go through\r\nthe institution.\" As the car lurched over its uneven roadbed, back\r\ntoward Lincoln, Alexandra thought of how she and Frank had been\r\nwrecked by the same storm and of how, although she could come out\r\ninto the sunlight, she had not much more left in her life than\r\nhe. She remembered some lines from a poem she had liked in her\r\nschooldays:--\r\n\r\n   Henceforth the world will only be\r\n   A wider prison-house to me,--\r\n\r\nand sighed. A disgust of life weighed upon her heart; some such\r\nfeeling as had twice frozen Frank Shabata's features while they\r\ntalked together. She wished she were back on the Divide.\r\n\r\nWhen Alexandra entered her hotel, the clerk held up one finger\r\nand beckoned to her. As she approached his desk, he handed her a\r\ntelegram. Alexandra took the yellow envelope and looked at it in\r\nperplexity, then stepped into the elevator without opening it. As\r\nshe walked down the corridor toward her room, she reflected that\r\nshe was, in a manner, immune from evil tidings. On reaching her\r\nroom she locked the door, and sitting down on a chair by the dresser,\r\nopened the telegram. It was from Hanover, and it read:--\r\n\r\n   Arrived Hanover last night. Shall wait here until you come.\r\n   Please hurry. CARL LINSTRUM.\r\n\r\nAlexandra put her head down on the dresser and burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon Carl and Alexandra were walking across the fields\r\nfrom Mrs. Hiller's. Alexandra had left Lincoln after midnight,\r\nand Carl had met her at the Hanover station early in the morning.\r\nAfter they reached home, Alexandra had gone over to Mrs. Hiller's\r\nto leave a little present she had bought for her in the city. They\r\nstayed at the old lady's door but a moment, and then came out to\r\nspend the rest of the afternoon in the sunny fields.\r\n\r\nAlexandra had taken off her black traveling suit and put on\r\na white dress; partly because she saw that her black clothes made\r\nCarl uncomfortable and partly because she felt oppressed by them\r\nherself. They seemed a little like the prison where she had worn\r\nthem yesterday, and to be out of place in the open fields. Carl\r\nhad changed very little. His cheeks were browner and fuller. He\r\nlooked less like a tired scholar than when he went away a year ago,\r\nbut no one, even now, would have taken him for a man of business.\r\nHis soft, lustrous black eyes, his whimsical smile, would be less\r\nagainst him in the Klondike than on the Divide. There are always\r\ndreamers on the frontier.\r\n\r\nCarl and Alexandra had been talking since morning. Her letter had\r\nnever reached him. He had first learned of her misfortune from\r\na San Francisco paper, four weeks old, which he had picked up in\r\na saloon, and which contained a brief account of Frank Shabata's\r\ntrial. When he put down the paper, he had already made up his\r\nmind that he could reach Alexandra as quickly as a letter could;\r\nand ever since he had been on the way; day and night, by the fastest\r\nboats and trains he could catch. His steamer had been held back\r\ntwo days by rough weather.\r\n\r\nAs they came out of Mrs. Hiller's garden they took up their talk\r\nagain where they had left it.\r\n\r\n\"But could you come away like that, Carl, without arranging things?\r\nCould you just walk off and leave your business?\" Alexandra asked.\r\n\r\nCarl laughed. \"Prudent Alexandra! You see, my dear, I happen to\r\nhave an honest partner. I trust him with everything. In fact,\r\nit's been his enterprise from the beginning, you know. I'm in it\r\nonly because he took me in. I'll have to go back in the spring.\r\nPerhaps you will want to go with me then. We haven't turned up\r\nmillions yet, but we've got a start that's worth following. But\r\nthis winter I'd like to spend with you. You won't feel that we\r\nought to wait longer, on Emil's account, will you, Alexandra?\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra shook her head. \"No, Carl; I don't feel that way about\r\nit. And surely you needn't mind anything Lou and Oscar say now.\r\nThey are much angrier with me about Emil, now, than about you.\r\nThey say it was all my fault. That I ruined him by sending him to\r\ncollege.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't care a button for Lou or Oscar. The moment I knew\r\nyou were in trouble, the moment I thought you might need me, it all\r\nlooked different. You've always been a triumphant kind of person.\"\r\nCarl hesitated, looking sidewise at her strong, full figure. \"But\r\nyou do need me now, Alexandra?\"\r\n\r\nShe put her hand on his arm. \"I needed you terribly when it\r\nhappened, Carl. I cried for you at night. Then everything seemed\r\nto get hard inside of me, and I thought perhaps I should never care\r\nfor you again. But when I got your telegram yesterday, then--then\r\nit was just as it used to be. You are all I have in the world,\r\nyou know.\"\r\n\r\nCarl pressed her hand in silence. They were passing the Shabatas'\r\nempty house now, but they avoided the orchard path and took one\r\nthat led over by the pasture pond.\r\n\r\n\"Can you understand it, Carl?\" Alexandra murmured. \"I have had\r\nnobody but Ivar and Signa to talk to. Do talk to me. Can you\r\nunderstand it? Could you have believed that of Marie Tovesky? I\r\nwould have been cut to pieces, little by little, before I would\r\nhave betrayed her trust in me!\"\r\n\r\nCarl looked at the shining spot of water before them. \"Maybe she\r\nwas cut to pieces, too, Alexandra. I am sure she tried hard; they\r\nboth did. That was why Emil went to Mexico, of course. And he was\r\ngoing away again, you tell me, though he had only been home three\r\nweeks. You remember that Sunday when I went with Emil up to\r\nthe French Church fair? I thought that day there was some kind\r\nof feeling, something unusual, between them. I meant to talk to\r\nyou about it. But on my way back I met Lou and Oscar and got so\r\nangry that I forgot everything else. You mustn't be hard on them,\r\nAlexandra. Sit down here by the pond a minute. I want to tell\r\nyou something.\"\r\n\r\nThey sat down on the grass-tufted bank and Carl told her how he had\r\nseen Emil and Marie out by the pond that morning, more than a year\r\nago, and how young and charming and full of grace they had seemed\r\nto him. \"It happens like that in the world sometimes, Alexandra,\"\r\nhe added earnestly. \"I've seen it before. There are women who\r\nspread ruin around them through no fault of theirs, just by being\r\ntoo beautiful, too full of life and love. They can't help it.\r\nPeople come to them as people go to a warm fire in winter. I used\r\nto feel that in her when she was a little girl. Do you remember\r\nhow all the Bohemians crowded round her in the store that day, when\r\nshe gave Emil her candy? You remember those yellow sparks in her\r\neyes?\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra sighed. \"Yes. People couldn't help loving her. Poor\r\nFrank does, even now, I think; though he's got himself in such\r\na tangle that for a long time his love has been bitterer than his\r\nhate. But if you saw there was anything wrong, you ought to have\r\ntold me, Carl.\"\r\n\r\nCarl took her hand and smiled patiently. \"My dear, it was something\r\none felt in the air, as you feel the spring coming, or a storm in\r\nsummer. I didn't SEE anything. Simply, when I was with those two\r\nyoung things, I felt my blood go quicker, I felt--how shall I say\r\nit?--an acceleration of life. After I got away, it was all too\r\ndelicate, too intangible, to write about.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandra looked at him mournfully. \"I try to be more liberal\r\nabout such things than I used to be. I try to realize that we are\r\nnot all made alike. Only, why couldn't it have been Raoul Marcel,\r\nor Jan Smirka? Why did it have to be my boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he was the best there was, I suppose. They were both the\r\nbest you had here.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun was dropping low in the west when the two friends rose and\r\ntook the path again. The straw-stacks were throwing long shadows,\r\nthe owls were flying home to the prairie-dog town. When they came\r\nto the corner where the pastures joined, Alexandra's twelve young\r\ncolts were galloping in a drove over the brow of the hill.\r\n\r\n\"Carl,\" said Alexandra, \"I should like to go up there with you in\r\nthe spring. I haven't been on the water since we crossed the ocean,\r\nwhen I was a little girl. After we first came out here I used\r\nto dream sometimes about the shipyard where father worked, and a\r\nlittle sort of inlet, full of masts.\" Alexandra paused. After a\r\nmoment's thought she said, \"But you would never ask me to go away\r\nfor good, would you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not, my dearest. I think I know how you feel about this\r\ncountry as well as you do yourself.\" Carl took her hand in both\r\nhis own and pressed it tenderly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I still feel that way, though Emil is gone. When I was on\r\nthe train this morning, and we got near Hanover, I felt something\r\nlike I did when I drove back with Emil from the river that time,\r\nin the dry year. I was glad to come back to it. I've lived here\r\na long time. There is great peace here, Carl, and freedom....\r\nI thought when I came out of that prison, where poor Frank is,\r\nthat I should never feel free again. But I do, here.\" Alexandra\r\ntook a deep breath and looked off into the red west.\r\n\r\n\"You belong to the land,\" Carl murmured, \"as you have always said.\r\nNow more than ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, now more than ever. You remember what you once said about\r\nthe graveyard, and the old story writing itself over? Only it is\r\nwe who write it, with the best we have.\"\r\n\r\nThey paused on the last ridge of the pasture, overlooking the\r\nhouse and the windmill and the stables that marked the site of John\r\nBergson's homestead. On every side the brown waves of the earth\r\nrolled away to meet the sky.\r\n\r\n\"Lou and Oscar can't see those things,\" said Alexandra suddenly.\r\n\"Suppose I do will my land to their children, what difference will\r\nthat make? The land belongs to the future, Carl; that's the way\r\nit seems to me. How many of the names on the county clerk's plat\r\nwill be there in fifty years? I might as well try to will the\r\nsunset over there to my brother's children. We come and go, but\r\nthe land is always here. And the people who love it and understand\r\nit are the people who own it--for a little while.\"\r\n\r\nCarl looked at her wonderingly. She was still gazing into the west,\r\nand in her face there was that exalted serenity that sometimes came\r\nto her at moments of deep feeling. The level rays of the sinking\r\nsun shone in her clear eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you thinking of such things now, Alexandra?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had a dream before I went to Lincoln--But I will tell you about\r\nthat afterward, after we are married. It will never come true,\r\nnow, in the way I thought it might.\" She took Carl's arm and they\r\nwalked toward the gate. \"How many times we have walked this path\r\ntogether, Carl. How many times we will walk it again! Does it seem\r\nto you like coming back to your own place? Do you feel at peace\r\nwith the world here? I think we shall be very happy. I haven't\r\nany fears. I think when friends marry, they are safe. We don't\r\nsuffer like--those young ones.\" Alexandra ended with a sigh.\r\n\r\nThey had reached the gate. Before Carl opened it, he drew Alexandra\r\nto him and kissed her softly, on her lips and on her eyes.\r\n\r\nShe leaned heavily on his shoulder. \"I am tired,\" she murmured.\r\n\"I have been very lonely, Carl.\"\r\n\r\nThey went into the house together, leaving the Divide behind them,\r\nunder the evening star. Fortunate country, that is one day to\r\nreceive hearts like Alexandra's into its bosom, to give them out\r\nagain in the yellow wheat, in the rustling corn, in the shining\r\neyes of youth!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}hrub,\r\n  Disporting, till the amorous Bird of Night\r\n  Sung Spousal, and bid haste the Eevning Starr\r\n  On his Hill top, to light the bridal Lamp.\r\n  Thus I have told thee all my State, and brought\r\n  My Storie to the sum of earthly bliss\r\n  Which I enjoy, and must confess to find\r\n  In all things else delight indeed, but such\r\n  As us'd or not, works in the mind no change,\r\n  Nor vehement desire, these delicacies\r\n  I mean of Taste, Sight, Smell, Herbs, Fruits, & Flours,\r\n  Walks, and the melodie of Birds; but here\r\n  Farr otherwise, transported I behold,\r\n  Transported touch; here passion first I felt,\r\n  Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else\r\n  Superiour and unmov'd, here onely weake\r\n  Against the charm of Beauties powerful glance.\r\n  Or Nature faild in mee, and left some part\r\n  Not proof enough such Object to sustain,\r\n  Or from my side subducting, took perhaps\r\n  More then enough; at least on her bestow'd\r\n  Too much of Ornament, in outward shew\r\n  Elaborate, of inward less exact.\r\n  For well I understand in the prime end\r\n  Of Nature her th' inferiour, in the mind\r\n  And inward Faculties, which most excell,\r\n  In outward also her resembling less\r\n  His Image who made both, and less expressing\r\n  The character of that Dominion giv'n\r\n  O're other Creatures; yet when I approach\r\n  Her loveliness, so absolute she seems\r\n  And in her self compleat, so well to know\r\n  Her own, that what she wills to do or say,\r\n  Seems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, best;\r\n  All higher knowledge in her presence falls\r\n  Degraded, Wisdom in discourse with her\r\n  Looses discount'nanc't, and like folly shewes;\r\n  Authoritie and Reason on her waite,\r\n  As one intended first, not after made\r\n  Occasionally; and to consummate all,\r\n  Greatness of mind and nobleness thir seat\r\n  Build in her loveliest, and create an awe\r\n  About her, as a guard Angelic plac't.\r\n  To whom the Angel with contracted brow.\r\n\r\n    Accuse not Nature, she hath don her part;\r\n  Do thou but thine, and be not diffident\r\n  Of Wisdom, she deserts thee not, if thou\r\n  Dismiss not her, when most thou needst her nigh,\r\n  By attributing overmuch to things\r\n  Less excellent, as thou thy self perceav'st.\r\n  For what admir'st thou, what transports thee so,\r\n  An outside?

Let it suffice thee that thou know'st\r\n  Us happie, and without Love no happiness.\r\n  Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy'st\r\n  (And pure thou wert created) we enjoy\r\n  In eminence, and obstacle find none\r\n  Of membrane, joynt, or limb, exclusive barrs:\r\n  Easier then Air with Air, if Spirits embrace,\r\n  Total they mix, Union of Pure with Pure\r\n  Desiring; nor restrain'd conveyance need\r\n  As Flesh to mix with Flesh, or Soul with Soul.\r\n  But I can now no more; the parting Sun\r\n  Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles\r\n  HESPEREAN sets, my Signal to depart.\r\n  Be strong, live happie, and love, but first of all\r\n  Him whom to love is to obey, and keep\r\n  His great command; take heed least Passion sway\r\n  Thy Judgement to do aught, which else free Will\r\n  Would not admit; thine and of all thy Sons\r\n  The weal or woe in thee is plac't; beware.\r\n  I in thy persevering shall rejoyce,\r\n  And all the Blest: stand fast; to stand or fall\r\n  Free in thine own Arbitrement it lies.\r\n  Perfet within, no outward aid require;\r\n  And all temptation to transgress repel.\r\n\r\n    So saying, he arose; whom ADAM thus\r\n  Follow'd with benediction.  Since to part,\r\n  Go heavenly Guest, Ethereal Messenger,\r\n  Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore.\r\n  Gentle to me and affable hath been\r\n  Thy condescension, and shall be honour'd ever\r\n  With grateful Memorie: thou to mankind\r\n  Be good and friendly still, and oft return.\r\n\r\n    So parted they, the Angel up to Heav'n\r\n  From the thick shade, and ADAM to his Bowre.\r\n\r\n       THE END OF THE SEVENTH BOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PARADISE LOST\r\n\r\n  BOOK VIII.\r\n\r\n  No more of talk where God or Angel Guest\r\n  With Man, as with his Friend, familiar us'd\r\n  To sit indulgent, and with him partake\r\n  Rural repast, permitting him the while\r\n  Venial discourse unblam'd: I now must change\r\n  Those Notes to Tragic; foul distrust, and breach\r\n  Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt\r\n  And disobedience: On the part of Heav'n\r\n  Now alienated, distance and distaste,\r\n  Anger and just rebuke, and judgement giv'n,\r\n  That brought into this World a world of woe,\r\n  Sinne and her shadow Death, and Miserie\r\n  Deaths Harbinger: Sad task, yet argument\r\n  Not less but more Heroic then the wrauth\r\n  Of stern ACHILLES on his Foe pursu'd\r\n  Thrice Fugitive about TROY Wall; or rage\r\n  Of TURNUS for LAVINIA disespous'd,\r\n  Or NEPTUN'S ire or JUNO'S, that so long\r\n  Perplex'd the GREEK and CYTHEREA'S Son;\r\n  If answerable style I can obtaine\r\n  Of my Celestial Patroness, who deignes\r\n  Her nightly visitation unimplor'd,\r\n  And dictates to me slumbring, or inspires\r\n  Easie my unpremeditated Verse:\r\n  Since first this subject for Heroic Song\r\n  Pleas'd me long choosing, and beginning late;\r\n  Not sedulous by Nature to indite\r\n  Warrs, hitherto the onely Argument\r\n  Heroic deem'd, chief maistrie to dissect\r\n  With long and tedious havoc fabl'd Knights\r\n  In Battels feign'd; the better fortitude\r\n  Of Patience and Heroic Martyrdom\r\n  Unsung; or to describe Races and Games,\r\n  Or tilting Furniture, emblazon'd Shields,\r\n  Impreses quaint, Caparisons and Steeds;\r\n  Bases and tinsel Trappings, gorgious Knights\r\n  At Joust and Torneament; then marshal'd Feast\r\n  Serv'd up in Hall with Sewers, and Seneshals;\r\n  The skill of Artifice or Office mean,\r\n  Not that which justly gives Heroic name\r\n  To Person or to Poem.  Mee of these\r\n  Nor skilld nor studious, higher Argument\r\n  Remaines, sufficient of it self to raise\r\n  That name, unless an age too late, or cold\r\n  Climat, or Years damp my intended wing\r\n  Deprest, and much they may, if all be mine,\r\n  Not Hers who brings it nightly to my Ear.\r\n\r\n    The Sun was sunk, and after him the Starr\r\n  Of HESPERUS, whose Office is to bring\r\n  Twilight upon the Earth, short Arbiter\r\n  Twixt Day and Night, and now from end to end\r\n  Nights Hemisphere had veild the Horizon round:\r\n  When SATAN who late fled before the threats\r\n  Of GABRIEL out of EDEN, now improv'd\r\n  In meditated fraud and malice, bent\r\n  On mans destruction, maugre what might hap\r\n  Of heavier on himself, fearless return'd.\r\n  By Night he fled, and at Midnight return'd\r\n  From compassing the Earth, cautious of day,\r\n  Since URIEL Regent of the Sun descri'd\r\n  His entrance, and forewarnd the Cherubim\r\n  That kept thir watch; thence full of anguish driv'n,\r\n  The space of seven continu'd Nights he rode\r\n  With darkness, thrice the Equinoctial Line\r\n  He circl'd, four times cross'd the Carr of Night\r\n  From Pole to Pole, traversing each Colure;\r\n  On the eighth return'd, and on the Coast averse\r\n  From entrance or Cherubic Watch, by stealth\r\n  Found unsuspected way.  There was a place,\r\n  Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change,\r\n  Where TIGRIS at the foot of Paradise\r\n  Into a Gulf shot under ground, till part\r\n  Rose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life;\r\n  In with the River sunk, and with it rose\r\n  Satan involv'd in rising Mist, then sought\r\n  Where to lie hid; Sea he had searcht and Land\r\n  From EDEN over PONTUS, and the Poole\r\n  MAEOTIS, up beyond the River OB;\r\n  Downward as farr Antartic; and in length\r\n  West from ORANTES to the Ocean barr'd\r\n  At DARIEN, thence to the Land where flowes\r\n  GANGES and INDUS: thus the Orb he roam'd\r\n  With narrow search; and with inspection deep\r\n  Consider'd every Creature, which of all\r\n  Most opportune might serve his Wiles, and found\r\n  The Serpent suttlest Beast of all the Field.\r\n  Him after long debate, irresolute\r\n  Of thoughts revolv'd, his final sentence chose\r\n  Fit Vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom\r\n  To enter, and his dark suggestions hide\r\n  From sharpest sight: for in the wilie Snake,\r\n  Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark,\r\n  As from his wit and native suttletie\r\n  Proceeding, which in other Beasts observ'd\r\n  Doubt might beget of Diabolic pow'r\r\n  Active within beyond the sense of brute.\r\n  Thus he resolv'd, but first from inward griefe\r\n  His bursting passion into plaints thus pour'd:\r\n\r\n    O Earth, how like to Heav'n, if not preferrd\r\n  More justly, Seat worthier of Gods, as built\r\n  With second thoughts, reforming what was old!\r\n  For what God after better worse would build?\r\n  Terrestrial Heav'n, danc't round by other Heav'ns\r\n  That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps,\r\n  Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems,\r\n  In thee concentring all thir precious beams\r\n  Of sacred influence: As God in Heav'n\r\n  Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou\r\n  Centring receav'st from all those Orbs; in thee,\r\n  Not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers\r\n  Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth\r\n  Of Creatures animate with gradual life\r\n  Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ'd up in Man.\r\n  With what delight could I have walkt thee round\r\n  If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange\r\n  Of Hill and Vallie, Rivers, Woods and Plaines,\r\n  Now Land, now Sea, & Shores with Forrest crownd,\r\n  Rocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these\r\n  Find place or refuge; and the more I see\r\n  Pleasures about me, so much more I feel\r\n  Torment within me, as from the hateful siege\r\n  Of contraries; all good to me becomes\r\n  Bane, and in Heav'n much worse would be my state.\r\n  But neither here seek I, no nor in Heav'n\r\n  To dwell, unless by maistring Heav'ns Supreame;\r\n  Nor hope to be my self less miserable\r\n  By what I seek, but others to make such\r\n  As I though thereby worse to me redound:\r\n  For onely in destroying I finde ease\r\n  To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd,\r\n  Or won to what may work his utter loss,\r\n  For whom all this was made, all this will soon\r\n  Follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe,\r\n  In wo then; that destruction wide may range:\r\n  To mee shall be the glorie sole among\r\n  The infernal Powers, in one day to have marr'd\r\n  What he ALMIGHTIE styl'd, six Nights and Days\r\n  Continu'd making, and who knows how long\r\n  Before had bin contriving, though perhaps\r\n  Not longer then since I in one Night freed\r\n  From servitude inglorious welnigh half\r\n  Th' Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng\r\n  Of his adorers: hee to be aveng'd,\r\n  And to repaire his numbers thus impair'd,\r\n  Whether such vertue spent of old now faild\r\n  More Angels to Create, if they at least\r\n  Are his Created or to spite us more,\r\n  Determin'd to advance into our room\r\n  A Creature form'd of Earth, and him endow,\r\n  Exalted from so base original,\r\n  With Heav'nly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed\r\n  He effected; Man he made, and for him built\r\n  Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat,\r\n  Him Lord pronounc'd, and, O indignitie!\r\n  Subjected to his service Angel wings,\r\n  And flaming Ministers to watch and tend\r\n  Thir earthlie Charge: Of these the vigilance\r\n  I dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist\r\n  Of midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie\r\n  In every Bush and Brake, where hap may finde\r\n  The Serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds\r\n  To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.\r\n  O foul descent! that I who erst contended\r\n  With Gods to sit the highest, am now constraind\r\n  Into a Beast, and mixt with bestial slime,\r\n  This essence to incarnate and imbrute,\r\n  That to the hight of Deitie aspir'd;\r\n  But what will not Ambition and Revenge\r\n  Descend to? who aspires must down as low\r\n  As high he soard, obnoxious first or last\r\n  To basest things.  Revenge, at first though sweet,\r\n  Bitter ere long back on it self recoiles;\r\n  Let it; I reck not, so it light well aim'd,\r\n  Since higher I fall short, on him who next\r\n  Provokes my envie, this new Favorite\r\n  Of Heav'n, this Man of Clay, Son of despite,\r\n  Whom us the more to spite his Maker rais'd\r\n  From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid.\r\n\r\n    So saying, through each Thicket Danck or Drie,\r\n  Like a black mist low creeping, he held on\r\n  His midnight search, where soonest he might finde\r\n  The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found\r\n  In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowl'd,\r\n  His head the midst, well stor'd with suttle wiles:\r\n  Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den,\r\n  Not nocent yet, but on the grassie Herbe\r\n  Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth\r\n  The Devil enterd, and his brutal sense,\r\n  In heart or head, possessing soon inspir'd\r\n  With act intelligential; but his sleep\r\n  Disturbd not, waiting close th' approach of Morn.\r\n  Now whenas sacred Light began to dawne\r\n  In EDEN on the humid Flours, that breathd\r\n  Thir morning Incense, when all things that breath,\r\n  From th' Earths great Altar send up silent praise\r\n  To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill\r\n  With gratefull Smell, forth came the human pair\r\n  And joynd thir vocal Worship to the Quire\r\n  Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake\r\n  The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires:\r\n  Then commune how that day they best may ply\r\n  Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew\r\n  The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide.\r\n  And EVE first to her Husband thus began.\r\n\r\n    ADAM, well may we labour still to dress\r\n  This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour.\r\n  Our pleasant task enjoyn'd, but till more hands\r\n  Aid us, the work under our labour grows,\r\n  Luxurious by restraint; what we by day\r\n  Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,\r\n  One night or two with wanton growth derides\r\n  Tending to wilde.  Thou therefore now advise\r\n  Or hear what to my mind first thoughts present,\r\n  Let us divide our labours, thou where choice\r\n  Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind\r\n  The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct\r\n  The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I\r\n  In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt\r\n  With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon:\r\n  For while so near each other thus all day\r\n  Our task we choose, what wonder if no near\r\n  Looks intervene and smiles, or object new\r\n  Casual discourse draw on, which intermits\r\n  Our dayes work brought to little, though begun\r\n  Early, and th' hour of Supper comes unearn'd.\r\n\r\n    To whom mild answer ADAM thus return'd.\r\n  Sole EVE, Associate sole, to me beyond\r\n  Compare above all living Creatures deare,\r\n  Well hast thou motion'd, wel thy thoughts imployd\r\n  How we might best fulfill the work which here\r\n  God hath assign'd us, nor of me shalt pass\r\n  Unprais'd: for nothing lovelier can be found\r\n  In woman, then to studie houshold good,\r\n  And good workes in her Husband to promote.\r\n  Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos'd\r\n  Labour, as to debarr us when we need\r\n  Refreshment, whether food, or talk between,\r\n  Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse\r\n  Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow,\r\n  To brute deni'd, and are of Love the food,\r\n  Love not the lowest end of human life.\r\n  For not to irksom toile, but to delight\r\n  He made us, and delight to Reason joyn'd.\r\n  These paths and Bowers doubt not but our joynt\r\n  Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide\r\n  As we need walk, till younger hands ere long\r\n  Assist us: But if much converse perhaps\r\n  Thee satiate, to short absence I could yeild.\r\n  For solitude somtimes is best societie,\r\n  And short retirement urges sweet returne.\r\n  But other doubt possesses me, least harm\r\n  Befall thee sever'd from me; for thou knowst\r\n  What hath bin warn'd us, what malicious Foe\r\n  Envying our happiness, and of his own\r\n  Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame\r\n  By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand\r\n  Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find\r\n  His wish and best advantage, us asunder,\r\n  Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each\r\n  To other speedie aide might lend at need;\r\n  Whether his first design be to withdraw\r\n  Our fealtie from God, or to disturb\r\n  Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss\r\n  Enjoy'd by us excites his envie more;\r\n  Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side\r\n  That gave thee being, stil shades thee and protects.\r\n  The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,\r\n  Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies,\r\n  Who guards her, or with her the worst endures.\r\n\r\n    To whom the Virgin Majestie of EVE,\r\n  As one who loves, and some unkindness meets,\r\n  With sweet austeer composure thus reply'd.\r\n\r\n    Ofspring of Heav'n and Earth, and all Earths Lord,\r\n  That such an enemie we have, who seeks\r\n  Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne,\r\n  And from the parting Angel over-heard\r\n  As in a shadie nook I stood behind,\r\n  Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours.\r\n  But that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt\r\n  To God or thee, because we have a foe\r\n  May tempt it, I expected not to hear.\r\n  His violence thou fearst not, being such,\r\n  As wee, not capable of death or paine,\r\n  Can either not receave, or can repell.\r\n  His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs\r\n  Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love\r\n  Can by his fraud be shak'n or seduc't;\r\n  Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy Brest,\r\n  ADAM, misthought of her to thee so dear?\r\n\r\n    To whom with healing words ADAM reply'd.\r\n  Daughter of God and Man, immortal EVE,\r\n  For such thou art, from sin and blame entire:\r\n  Not diffident of thee do I dissuade\r\n  Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid\r\n  Th' attempt it self, intended by our Foe.\r\n  For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses\r\n  The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos'd\r\n  Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff\r\n  Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne\r\n  And anger wouldst resent the offer'd wrong,\r\n  Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then,\r\n  If such affront I labour to avert\r\n  From thee alone, which on us both at once\r\n  The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare,\r\n  Or daring, first on mee th' assault shall light.\r\n  Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn;\r\n  Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce\r\n  Angels, nor think superfluous others aid.\r\n  I from the influence of thy looks receave\r\n  Access in every Vertue, in thy sight\r\n  More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were\r\n  Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on,\r\n  Shame to be overcome or over-reacht\r\n  Would utmost vigor raise, and rais'd unite.\r\n  Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel\r\n  When I am present, and thy trial choose\r\n  With me, best witness of thy Vertue tri'd.\r\n\r\n    So spake domestick ADAM in his care\r\n  And Matrimonial Love, but EVE, who thought\r\n  Less attributed to her Faith sincere,\r\n  Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd.\r\n\r\n    If this be our condition, thus to dwell\r\n  In narrow circuit strait'nd by a Foe,\r\n  Suttle or violent, we not endu'd\r\n  Single with like defence, wherever met,\r\n  How are we happie, still in fear of harm?\r\n  But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe\r\n  Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem\r\n  Of our integritie: his foul esteeme\r\n  Sticks no dishonor on our Front, but turns\r\n  Foul on himself; then wherfore shund or feard\r\n  By us? who rather double honour gaine\r\n  From his surmise prov'd false, finde peace within,\r\n  Favour from Heav'n, our witness from th' event.\r\n  And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid\r\n  Alone, without exterior help sustaind?\r\n  Let us not then suspect our happie State\r\n  Left so imperfet by the Maker wise,\r\n  As not secure to single or combin'd.\r\n  Fraile is our happiness, if this be so,\r\n  And EDEN were no EDEN thus expos'd.\r\n\r\n    To whom thus ADAM fervently repli'd.\r\n  O Woman, best are all things as the will\r\n  Of God ordaind them, his creating hand\r\n  Nothing imperfet or deficient left\r\n  Of all that he Created, much less Man,\r\n  Or ought that might his happie State secure,\r\n  Secure from outward force; within himself\r\n  The danger lies, yet lies within his power:\r\n  Against his will he can receave no harme.\r\n  But God left free the Will, for what obeyes\r\n  Reason, is free, and Reason he made right,\r\n  But bid her well beware, and still erect,\r\n  Least by some faire appeering good surpris'd\r\n  She dictate false, and missinforme the Will\r\n  To do what God expresly hath forbid.\r\n  Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes,\r\n  That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me.\r\n  Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve,\r\n  Since Reason not impossibly may meet\r\n  Some specious object by the Foe subornd,\r\n  And fall into deception unaware,\r\n  Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd.\r\n  Seek not temptation then, which to avoide\r\n  Were better, and most likelie if from mee\r\n  Thou sever not; Trial will come unsought.\r\n  Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve\r\n  First thy obedience; th' other who can know,\r\n  Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?\r\n  But if thou think, trial unsought may finde\r\n  Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst,\r\n  Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more;\r\n  Go in thy native innocence, relie\r\n  On what thou hast of vertue, summon all,\r\n  For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine.\r\n\r\n    So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but EVE\r\n  Persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli'd.\r\n\r\n    With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd\r\n  Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words\r\n  Touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought,\r\n  May finde us both perhaps farr less prepar'd,\r\n  The willinger I goe, nor much expect\r\n  A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek;\r\n  So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse.\r\n  Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand\r\n  Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light\r\n  OREAD or DRYAD, or of DELIA's Traine,\r\n  Betook her to the Groves, but DELIA's self\r\n  In gate surpass'd and Goddess-like deport,\r\n  Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd,\r\n  But with such Gardning Tools as Are yet rude,\r\n  Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought,\r\n  To PALES, or POMONA, thus adornd,\r\n  Likest she seemd, POMONA when she fled\r\n  VERTUMNUS, or to CERES in her Prime,\r\n  Yet Virgin of PROSERPINA from JOVE.\r\n  Her long with ardent look his EYE pursu'd\r\n  Delighted, but desiring more her stay.\r\n  Oft he to her his charge of quick returne,\r\n  Repeated, shee to him as oft engag'd\r\n  To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre,\r\n  And all things in best order to invite\r\n  Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose.\r\n  O much deceav'd, much failing, hapless EVE,\r\n  Of thy presum'd return! event perverse!\r\n  Thou never from that houre in Paradise\r\n  Foundst either sweet repast, or found repose;\r\n  Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades\r\n  Waited with hellish rancor imminent\r\n  To intercept thy way, or send thee back\r\n  Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss.\r\n  For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend,\r\n  Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come,\r\n  And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde\r\n  The onely two of Mankinde, but in them\r\n  The whole included Race, his purposd prey.\r\n  In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft\r\n  Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay,\r\n  Thir tendance or Plantation for delight,\r\n  By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet\r\n  He sought them both, but wish'd his hap might find\r\n  EVE separate, he wish'd, but not with hope\r\n  Of what so seldom chanc'd, when to his wish,\r\n  Beyond his hope, EVE separate he spies,\r\n  Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood,\r\n  Half spi'd, so thick the Roses bushing round\r\n  About her glowd, oft stooping to support\r\n  Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay\r\n  Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold,\r\n  Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies\r\n  Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while,\r\n  Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour,\r\n  From her best prop so farr, and storn so nigh.\r\n  Neererhe drew, and many a walk travers'd\r\n  Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme,\r\n  Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen\r\n  Among thick-wov'n Arborets and Flours\r\n  Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of EVE:\r\n  Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign'd\r\n  Or of reviv'd ADONIS, or renownd\r\n  ALCINOUS, host of old LAERTES Son,\r\n  Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King\r\n  Held dalliance with his faire EGYPTIAN Spouse.\r\n  Much hee the Place admir'd, the Person more.\r\n  As one who long in populous City pent,\r\n  Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire,\r\n  Forth issuing on a Summers Morn, to breathe\r\n  Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes\r\n  Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight,\r\n  The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine,\r\n  Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound;\r\n  If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass,\r\n  What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more,\r\n  She most, and in her look summs all Delight.\r\n  Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold\r\n  This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of EVE\r\n  Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav'nly forme\r\n  Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine,\r\n  Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire\r\n  Of gesture or lest action overawd\r\n  His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav'd\r\n  His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought:\r\n  That space the Evil one abstracted stood\r\n  From his own evil, and for the time remaind\r\n  Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm'd,\r\n  Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge;\r\n  But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes,\r\n  Though in mid Heav'n, soon ended his delight,\r\n  And tortures him now more, the more he sees\r\n  Of pleasure not for him ordain'd: then soon\r\n  Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts\r\n  Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites.\r\n\r\n    Thoughts, whither have he led me, with what sweet\r\n  Compulsion thus transported to forget\r\n  What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope\r\n  Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste\r\n  Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy,\r\n  Save what is in destroying, other joy\r\n  To me is lost.  Then let me not let pass\r\n  Occasion which now smiles, behold alone\r\n  The Woman, opportune to all attempts,\r\n  Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh,\r\n  Whose higher intellectual more I shun,\r\n  And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb\r\n  Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould,\r\n  Foe not informidable, exempt from wound,\r\n  I not; so much hath Hell debas'd, and paine\r\n  Infeebl'd me, to what I was in Heav'n.\r\n  Shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods,\r\n  Not terrible, though terrour be in Love\r\n  And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate,\r\n  Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feign'd,\r\n  The way which to her ruin now I tend.\r\n\r\n    So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos'd\r\n  In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward EVE\r\n  Address'd his way, not with indented wave,\r\n  Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare,\r\n  Circular base of rising foulds, that tour'd\r\n  Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head\r\n  Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes;\r\n  With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect\r\n  Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass\r\n  Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape,\r\n  And lovely, never since of Serpent kind\r\n  Lovelier, not those that in ILLYRIA chang'd\r\n  HERMIONE and CADMUS, or the God\r\n  In EPIDAURUS; nor to which transformd\r\n  AMMONIAN JOVE, or CAPITOLINE was seen,\r\n  Hee with OLYMPIAS, this with her who bore\r\n  SCIPIO the highth of ROME.  With tract oblique\r\n  At first, as one who sought access, but feard\r\n  To interrupt, side-long he works his way.\r\n  As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought\r\n  Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind\r\n  Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile;\r\n  So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine\r\n  Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of EVE,\r\n  To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound\r\n  Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us'd\r\n  To such disport before her through the Field,\r\n  From every Beast, more duteous at her call,\r\n  Then at CIRCEAN call the Herd disguis'd.\r\n  Hee boulder now, uncall'd before her stood;\r\n  But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd\r\n  His turret Crest, and sleek enamel'd Neck,\r\n  Fawning, and lick'd the ground whereon she trod.\r\n  His gentle dumb expression turnd at length\r\n  The Eye of EVE to mark his play; he glad\r\n  Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue\r\n  Organic, or impulse of vocal Air,\r\n  His fraudulent temptation thus began.\r\n\r\n    Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps\r\n  Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm\r\n  Thy looks, the Heav'n of mildness, with disdain,\r\n  Displeas'd that I approach thee thus, and gaze\r\n  Insatiate, I thus single; nor have feard\r\n  Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir'd.\r\n  Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire,\r\n  Thee all living things gaze on, all things thine\r\n  By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore\r\n  With ravishment beheld, there best beheld\r\n  Where universally admir'd; but here\r\n  In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among,\r\n  Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne\r\n  Half what in thee is fair, one man except,\r\n  Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen\r\n  A Goddess among Gods, ador'd and serv'd\r\n  By Angels numberless, thy daily Train.\r\n\r\n    So gloz'd the Tempter, and his Proem tun'd;\r\n  Into the Heart of EVE his words made way,\r\n  Though at the voice much marveling; at length\r\n  Not unamaz'd she thus in answer spake.\r\n  What may this mean?  Language of Man pronounc't\r\n  By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest?\r\n  The first at lest of these I thought deni'd\r\n  To Beasts, whom God on their Creation-Day\r\n  Created mute to all articulat sound;\r\n  The latter I demurre, for in thir looks\r\n  Much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers.\r\n  Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field\r\n  I knew, but not with human voice endu'd;\r\n  Redouble then this miracle, and say,\r\n  How cam'st thou speakable of mute, and how\r\n  To me so friendly grown above the rest\r\n  Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight?\r\n  Say, for such wonder claims attention due.\r\n\r\n    To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply'd.\r\n  Empress of this fair World, resplendent EVE,\r\n  Easie to mee it is to tell thee all\r\n  What thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd:\r\n  I was at first as other Beasts that graze\r\n  The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low,\r\n  As was my food, nor aught but food discern'd\r\n  Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high:\r\n  Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc'd\r\n  A goodly Tree farr distant to behold\r\n  Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt,\r\n  Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze;\r\n  When from the boughes a savorie odour blow'n,\r\n  Grateful to appetite, more pleas'd my sense\r\n  Then smell of sweetest Fenel, or the Teats\r\n  Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn,\r\n  Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play.\r\n  To satisfie the sharp desire I had\r\n  Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv'd\r\n  Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once,\r\n  Powerful perswaders, quick'nd at the scent\r\n  Of that alluring fruit, urg'd me so keene.\r\n  About the Mossie Trunk I wound me soon,\r\n  For high from ground the branches would require\r\n  Thy utmost reach or ADAMS: Round the Tree\r\n  All other Beasts that saw, with like desire\r\n  Longing and envying stood, but could not reach.\r\n  Amid the Tree now got, where plentie hung\r\n  Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill\r\n  I spar'd not, for such pleasure till that hour\r\n  At Feed or Fountain never had I found.\r\n  Sated at length, ere long I might perceave\r\n  Strange alteration in me, to degree\r\n  Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech\r\n  Wanted not long, though to this shape retaind.\r\n  Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep\r\n  I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind\r\n  Considerd all things visible in Heav'n,\r\n  Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good;\r\n  But all that fair and good in thy Divine\r\n  Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav'nly Ray\r\n  United I beheld; no Fair to thine\r\n  Equivalent or second, which compel'd\r\n  Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come\r\n  And gaze, and worship thee of right declar'd\r\n  Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame.\r\n\r\n    So talk'd the spirited sly Snake; and EVE\r\n  Yet more amaz'd unwarie thus reply'd.\r\n\r\n    Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt\r\n  The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov'd:\r\n  But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far?\r\n  For many are the Trees of God that grow\r\n  In Paradise, and various, yet unknown\r\n  To us, in such abundance lies our choice,\r\n  As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht,\r\n  Still hanging incorruptible, till men\r\n  Grow up to thir provision, and more hands\r\n  Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth.\r\n\r\n    To whom the wilie Adder, blithe and glad.\r\n  Empress, the way is readie, and not long,\r\n  Beyond a row of Myrtles, on a Flat,\r\n  Fast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past\r\n  Of blowing Myrrh and Balme; if thou accept\r\n  My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon.\r\n\r\n    Lead then, said EVE.  Hee leading swiftly rowld\r\n  In tangles, and make intricate seem strait,\r\n  To mischief swift.  Hope elevates, and joy\r\n  Bright'ns his Crest, as when a wandring Fire\r\n  Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night\r\n  Condenses, and the cold invirons round,\r\n  Kindl'd through agitation to a Flame,\r\n  Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends,\r\n  Hovering and blazing with delusive Light,\r\n  Misleads th' amaz'd Night-wanderer from his way\r\n  To Boggs and Mires, & oft through Pond or Poole,\r\n  There swallow'd up and lost, from succour farr.\r\n  So glister'd the dire Snake and into fraud\r\n  Led EVE our credulous Mother, to the Tree\r\n  Of prohibition, root of all our woe;\r\n  Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake.\r\n\r\n    Serpent, we might have spar'd our coming hither,\r\n  Fruitless to me, though Fruit be here to excess,\r\n  The credit of whose vertue rest with thee,\r\n  Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects.\r\n  But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch;\r\n  God so commanded, and left that Command\r\n  Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live\r\n  Law to our selves, our Reason is our Law.\r\n\r\n    To whom the Tempter guilefully repli'd.\r\n  Indeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit\r\n  Of all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate,\r\n  Yet Lords declar'd of all in Earth or Aire?\r\n\r\n    To whom thus EVE yet sinless.  Of the Fruit\r\n  Of each Tree in the Garden we may eate,\r\n  But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst\r\n  The Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate\r\n  Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die.\r\n\r\n    She scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold\r\n  The Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love\r\n  To Man, and indignation at his wrong,\r\n  New part puts on, and as to passion mov'd,\r\n  Fluctuats disturbd, yet comely, and in act\r\n  Rais'd, as of som great matter to begin.\r\n  As when of old som Orator renound\r\n  In ATHENS or free ROME, where Eloquence\r\n  Flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest,\r\n  Stood in himself collected, while each part,\r\n  Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue,\r\n  Somtimes in highth began, as no delay\r\n  Of Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right.\r\n  So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown\r\n  The Tempter all impassiond thus began.\r\n\r\n    O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant,\r\n  Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power\r\n  Within me cleere, not onely to discerne\r\n  Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes\r\n  Of highest Agents, deemd however wise.\r\n  Queen of this Universe, doe not believe\r\n  Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die:\r\n  How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life\r\n  To Knowledge?  By the Threatner, look on mee,\r\n  Mee who have touch'd and tasted, yet both live,\r\n  And life more perfet have attaind then Fate\r\n  Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot.\r\n  Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast\r\n  Is open? or will God incense his ire\r\n  For such a pretty Trespass, and not praise\r\n  Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain\r\n  Of Death denounc't, whatever thing Death be,\r\n  Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade\r\n  To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil;\r\n  Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil\r\n  Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd?\r\n  God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just;\r\n  Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeid:\r\n  Your feare it self of Death removes the feare.\r\n  Why then was this forbid?  Why but to awe,\r\n  Why but to keep ye low and ignorant,\r\n  His worshippers; he knows that in the day\r\n  Ye Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere,\r\n  Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then\r\n  Op'nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods,\r\n  Knowing both Good and Evil as they know.\r\n  That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man,\r\n  Internal Man, is but proportion meet,\r\n  I of brute human, yee of human Gods.\r\n  So ye shalt die perhaps, by putting off\r\n  Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht,\r\n  Though threat'nd, which no worse then this can bring\r\n  And what are Gods that Man may not become\r\n  As they, participating God-like food?\r\n  The Gods are first, and that advantage use\r\n  On our belief, that all from them proceeds,\r\n  I question it, for this fair Earth I see,\r\n  Warm'd by the Sun, producing every kind,\r\n  Them nothing: If they all things, who enclos'd\r\n  Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree,\r\n  That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains\r\n  Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies\r\n  Th' offence, that Man should thus attain to know?\r\n  What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree\r\n  Impart against his will if all be his?\r\n  Or is it envie, and can envie dwell\r\n  In heav'nly brests? these, these and many more\r\n  Causes import your need of this fair Fruit.\r\n  Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste.\r\n\r\n    He ended, and his words replete with guile\r\n  Into her heart too easie entrance won:\r\n  Fixt on the Fruit she gaz'd, which to behold\r\n  Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound\r\n  Yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn'd\r\n  With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth;\r\n  Meanwhile the hour of Noon drew on, and wak'd\r\n  An eager appetite, rais'd by the smell\r\n  So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire,\r\n  Inclinable now grown to touch or taste,\r\n  Sollicited her longing eye; yet first\r\n  Pausing a while, thus to her self she mus'd.\r\n\r\n    Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits,\r\n  Though kept from Man, & worthy to be admir'd,\r\n  Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay\r\n  Gave elocution to the mute, and taught\r\n  The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise:\r\n  Thy praise hee also who forbids thy use,\r\n  Conceales not from us, naming thee the Tree\r\n  Of Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil;\r\n  Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding\r\n  Commends thee more, while it inferrs the good\r\n  By thee communicated, and our want:\r\n  For good unknown, sure is not had, or had\r\n  And yet unknown, is as not had at all.\r\n  In plain then, what forbids he but to know,\r\n  Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise?\r\n  Such prohibitions binde not.  But if Death\r\n  Bind us with after-bands, what profits then\r\n  Our inward freedom?  In the day we eate\r\n  Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die.\r\n  How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat'n and lives,\r\n  And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discernes,\r\n  Irrational till then.  For us alone\r\n  Was death invented? or to us deni'd\r\n  This intellectual food, for beasts reserv'd?\r\n  For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first\r\n  Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy\r\n  The good befall'n him, Author unsuspect,\r\n  Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile.\r\n  What fear I then, rather what know to feare\r\n  Under this ignorance of Good and Evil,\r\n  Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie?\r\n  Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine,\r\n  Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste,\r\n  Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then\r\n  To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind?\r\n\r\n    So saying, her rash hand in evil hour\r\n  Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck'd, she eat:\r\n  Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat\r\n  Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe,\r\n  That all was lost.  Back to the Thicket slunk\r\n  The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for EVE\r\n  Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else\r\n  Regarded, such delight till then, as seemd,\r\n  In Fruit she never tasted, whether true\r\n  Or fansied so, through expectation high\r\n  Of knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought.\r\n  Greedily she ingorg'd without restraint,\r\n  And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length,\r\n  And hight'nd as with Wine, jocond and boon,\r\n  Thus to her self she pleasingly began.\r\n\r\n    O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees\r\n  In Paradise, of operation blest\r\n  To Sapience, hitherto obscur'd, infam'd,\r\n  And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end\r\n  Created; but henceforth my early care,\r\n  Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise\r\n  Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease\r\n  Of thy full branches offer'd free to all;\r\n  Till dieted by thee I grow mature\r\n  In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know;\r\n  Though others envie what they cannot give;\r\n  For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here\r\n  Thus grown.  Experience, next to thee I owe,\r\n  Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind\r\n  In ignorance, thou op'nst Wisdoms way,\r\n  And giv'st access, though secret she retire.\r\n  And I perhaps am secret; Heav'n is high,\r\n  High and remote to see from thence distinct\r\n  Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps\r\n  May have diverted from continual watch\r\n  Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies\r\n  About him.  But to ADAM in what sort\r\n  Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known\r\n  As yet my change, and give him to partake\r\n  Full happiness with mee, or rather not,\r\n  But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power\r\n  Without Copartner? so to add what wants\r\n  In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love,\r\n  And render me more equal, and perhaps\r\n  A thing not undesireable, somtime\r\n  Superior; for inferior who is free?\r\n  This may be well: but what if God have seen,\r\n  And Death ensue? then I shall be no more,\r\n  And ADAM wedded to another EVE,\r\n  Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct;\r\n  A death to think.  Confirm'd then I resolve,\r\n  ADAM shall share with me in bliss or woe:\r\n  So dear I love him, that with him all deaths\r\n  I could endure; without him live no life.\r\n\r\n    So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd,\r\n  But first low Reverence don, as to the power\r\n  That dwelt within, whose presence had infus'd\r\n  Into the plant sciential sap, deriv'd\r\n  From Nectar, drink of Gods.  ADAM the while\r\n  Waiting desirous her return, had wove\r\n  Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne\r\n  Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown\r\n  As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen.\r\n  Great joy he promis'd to his thoughts, and new\r\n  Solace in her return, so long delay'd;\r\n  Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill,\r\n  Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt;\r\n  And forth to meet her went, the way she took\r\n  That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree\r\n  Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met,\r\n  Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand\r\n  A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil'd,\r\n  New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus'd.\r\n  To him she hasted, in her face excuse\r\n  Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt,\r\n  Which with bland words at will she thus addrest.\r\n\r\n    Hast thou not wonderd, ADAM, at my stay?\r\n  Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv'd\r\n  Thy presence, agonie of love till now\r\n  Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more\r\n  Mean I to trie, what rash untri'd I sought,\r\n  The paine of absence from thy sight.  But strange\r\n  Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare:\r\n  This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree\r\n  Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown\r\n  Op'ning the way, but of Divine effect\r\n  To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste;\r\n  And hath bin tasted such; the Serpent wise,\r\n  Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying,\r\n  Hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become,\r\n  Not dead, as we are threatn'd, but thenceforth\r\n  Endu'd with human voice and human sense,\r\n  Reasoning to admiration, and with mee\r\n  Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I\r\n  Have also tasted, and have also found\r\n  Th' effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes,\r\n  Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart,\r\n  And growing up to Godhead; which for thee\r\n  Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.\r\n  For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss,\r\n  Tedious, unshar'd with thee, and odious soon.\r\n  Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot\r\n  May joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love;\r\n  Least thou not tasting, different degree\r\n  Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce\r\n  Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit.\r\n\r\n    Thus EVE with Countnance blithe her storie told;\r\n  But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd.\r\n  On th' other side, ADAM, soon as he heard\r\n  The fatal Trespass don by EVE, amaz'd,\r\n  Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill\r\n  Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax'd;\r\n  From his slack hand the Garland wreath'd for EVE\r\n  Down drop'd, and all the faded Roses shed:\r\n  Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length\r\n  First to himself he inward silence broke.\r\n\r\n    O fairest of Creation, last and best\r\n  Of all Gods Works, Creature in whom excell'd\r\n  Whatever can to fight or thought be found,\r\n  Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!\r\n  How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost,\r\n  Defac't, deflourd, and now to Death devote?\r\n  Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress\r\n  The strict forbiddance, how to violate\r\n  The sacred Fruit forbidd'n! som cursed fraud\r\n  Of Enemie hath beguil'd thee, yet unknown,\r\n  And mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee\r\n  Certain my resolution is to Die;\r\n  How can I live without thee, how forgoe\r\n  Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn'd,\r\n  To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn?\r\n  Should God create another EVE, and I\r\n  Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee\r\n  Would never from my heart; no no, I feel\r\n  The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh,\r\n  Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State\r\n  Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe.\r\n\r\n    So having said, as one from sad dismay\r\n  Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd\r\n  Submitting to what seemd remediless,\r\n  Thus in calme mood his Words to EVE he turnd.\r\n\r\n    Bold deed thou hast presum'd, adventrous EVE,\r\n  And peril great provok't, who thus hast dar'd\r\n  Had it bin onely coveting to Eye\r\n  That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence,\r\n  Much more to taste it under banne to touch.\r\n  But past who can recall, or don undoe?\r\n  Not God omnipotent, for Fate, yet so\r\n  Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact\r\n  Is not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit,\r\n  Profan'd first by the Serpent, by him first\r\n  Made common and unhallowd: ere one tastes;\r\n  Nor yet on him found deadly; he yet lives,\r\n  Lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man\r\n  Higher degree of Life, inducement strong\r\n  To us, as likely tasting to attaine\r\n  Proportional ascent, which cannot be\r\n  But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods.\r\n  Nor can I think that God, Creator wise,\r\n  Though threatning, will in earnest so destroy\r\n  Us his prime Creatures, dignifi'd so high,\r\n  Set over all his Works, which in our Fall,\r\n  For us created, needs with us must faile,\r\n  Dependent made; so God shall uncreate,\r\n  Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose,\r\n  Not well conceav'd of God, who though his Power\r\n  Creation could repeate, yet would be loath\r\n  Us to abolish, least the Adversary\r\n  Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God\r\n  Most Favors, who can please him long?  Mee first\r\n  He ruind, now Mankind; whom will he next?\r\n  Matter of scorne, not to be given the Foe.\r\n  However I with thee have fixt my Lot,\r\n  Certain to undergoe like doom, if Death\r\n  Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life;\r\n  So forcible within my heart I feel\r\n  The Bond of Nature draw me to my owne,\r\n  My own in thee, for what thou art is mine;\r\n  Our State cannot be severd, we are one,\r\n  One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self.\r\n\r\n    So ADAM, and thus EVE to him repli'd.\r\n  O glorious trial of exceeding Love,\r\n  Illustrious evidence, example high!\r\n  Ingaging me to emulate, but short\r\n  Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine,\r\n  ADAM, from whose deare side I boast me sprung,\r\n  And gladly of our Union heare thee speak,\r\n  One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff\r\n  This day affords, declaring thee resolvd,\r\n  Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread\r\n  Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare,\r\n  To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime,\r\n  If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit,\r\n  Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds,\r\n  Direct, or by occasion hath presented\r\n  This happie trial of thy Love, which else\r\n  So eminently never had bin known.\r\n  Were it I thought Death menac't would ensue\r\n  This my attempt, I would sustain alone\r\n  The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die\r\n  Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact\r\n  Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur'd\r\n  Remarkably so late of thy so true,\r\n  So faithful Love unequald; but I feel\r\n  Farr otherwise th' event, not Death, but Life\r\n  Augmented, op'nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes,\r\n  Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before\r\n  Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh.\r\n  On my experience, ADAM, freely taste,\r\n  And fear of Death deliver to the Windes.\r\n\r\n    So saying, she embrac'd him, and for joy\r\n  Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love\r\n  Had so enobl'd, as of choice to incurr\r\n  Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death.\r\n  In recompence (for such compliance bad\r\n  Such recompence best merits) from the bough\r\n  She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit\r\n  With liberal hand: he scrupl'd not to eat\r\n  Against his better knowledge, not deceav'd,\r\n  But fondly overcome with Femal charm.\r\n  Earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again\r\n  In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan,\r\n  Skie lowr'd, and muttering Thunder, som sad drops\r\n  Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin\r\n  Original; while ADAM took no thought,\r\n  Eating his fill, nor EVE to iterate\r\n  Her former trespass fear'd, the more to soothe\r\n  Him with her lov'd societie, that now\r\n  As with new Wine intoxicated both\r\n  They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel\r\n  Divinitie within them breeding wings\r\n  Wherewith to scorn the Earth: but that false Fruit\r\n  Farr other operation first displaid,\r\n  Carnal desire enflaming, hee on EVE\r\n  Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him\r\n  As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne:\r\n  Till ADAM thus 'gan EVE to dalliance move.\r\n\r\n    EVE, now I see thou art exact of taste,\r\n  And elegant, of Sapience no small part,\r\n  Since to each meaning savour we apply,\r\n  And Palate call judicious; I the praise\r\n  Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey'd.\r\n  Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain'd\r\n  From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now\r\n  True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be\r\n  In things to us forbidden, it might be wish'd,\r\n  For this one Tree had bin forbidden ten.\r\n  But come, so well refresh't, now let us play,\r\n  As meet is, after such delicious Fare;\r\n  For never did thy Beautie since the day\r\n  I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn'd\r\n  With all perfections, so enflame my sense\r\n  With ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now\r\n  Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree.\r\n\r\n    So said he, and forbore not glance or toy\r\n  Of amorous intent, well understood\r\n  Of EVE, whose Eye darted contagious Fire.\r\n  Her hand he seis'd, and to a shadie bank,\r\n  Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr'd\r\n  He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch,\r\n  Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel,\r\n  And Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap.\r\n  There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport\r\n  Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale,\r\n  The solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep\r\n  Oppress'd them, wearied with thir amorous play.\r\n  Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit,\r\n  That with exhilerating vapour bland\r\n  About thir spirits had plaid, and inmost powers\r\n  Made erre, was now exhal'd, and grosser sleep\r\n  Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams\r\n  Encumberd, now had left them, up they rose\r\n  As from unrest, and each the other viewing,\r\n  Soon found thir Eyes how op'nd, and thir minds\r\n  How dark'nd; innocence, that as a veile\r\n  Had shadow'd them from knowing ill, was gon,\r\n  Just confidence, and native righteousness,\r\n  And honour from about them, naked left\r\n  To guiltie shame hee cover'd, but his Robe\r\n  Uncover'd more.  So rose the DANITE strong\r\n  HERCULEAN SAMSON from the Harlot-lap\r\n  Of PHILISTEAN DALILAH, and wak'd\r\n  Shorn of his strength, They destitute and bare\r\n  Of all thir vertue: silent, and in face\r\n  Confounded long they sate, as struck'n mute,\r\n  Till ADAM, though not less then EVE abasht,\r\n  At length gave utterance to these words constraind.\r\n\r\n    O EVE, in evil hour thou didst give care\r\n  To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught\r\n  To counterfet Mans voice, true in our Fall,\r\n  False in our promis'd Rising; since our Eyes\r\n  Op'nd we find indeed, and find we know\r\n  Both Good and Evil, Good lost and Evil got,\r\n  Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know,\r\n  Which leaves us naked thus, of Honour void,\r\n  Of Innocence, of Faith, of Puritie,\r\n  Our wonted Ornaments now soild and staind,\r\n  And in our Faces evident the signes\r\n  Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store;\r\n  Even shame, the last of evils; of the first\r\n  Be sure then.  How shall I behold the face\r\n  Henceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy\r\n  And rapture so oft beheld? those heav'nly shapes\r\n  Will dazle now this earthly, with thir blaze\r\n  Insufferably bright.  O might I here\r\n  In solitude live savage, in some glad\r\n  Obscur'd, where highest Woods impenetrable\r\n  To Starr or Sun-light, spread thir umbrage broad,\r\n  And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines,\r\n  Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs\r\n  Hide me, where I may never see them more.\r\n  But let us now, as in bad plight, devise\r\n  What best may for the present serve to hide\r\n  The Parts of each from other, that seem most\r\n  To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen,\r\n  Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd,\r\n  And girded on our loyns, may cover round\r\n  Those middle parts, that this new commer, Shame,\r\n  There sit not, and reproach us as unclean.\r\n\r\n    So counsel'd hee, and both together went\r\n  Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose\r\n  The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renown'd,\r\n  But such as at this day to INDIANS known\r\n  In MALABAR or DECAN spreds her Armes\r\n  Braunching so broad and long, that in the ground\r\n  The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow\r\n  About the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade\r\n  High overarch't, and echoing Walks between;\r\n  There oft the INDIAN Herdsman shunning heate\r\n  Shelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds\r\n  At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves\r\n  They gatherd, broad as AMAZONIAN Targe,\r\n  And with what skill they had, together sowd,\r\n  To gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide\r\n  Thir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike\r\n  To that first naked Glorie.  Such of late\r\n  COLUMBUS found th' AMERICAN to girt\r\n  With featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde\r\n  Among the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores.\r\n  Thus fenc't, and as they thought, thir shame in part\r\n  Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind,\r\n  They sate them down to weep, nor onely Teares\r\n  Raind at thir Eyes, but high Winds worse within\r\n  Began to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate,\r\n  Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore\r\n  Thir inward State of Mind, calme Region once\r\n  And full of Peace, now tost and turbulent:\r\n  For Understanding rul'd not, and the Will\r\n  Heard not her lore, both in subjection now\r\n  To sensual Appetite, who from beneathe\r\n  Usurping over sovran Reason claimd\r\n  Superior sway: From thus distemperd brest,\r\n  ADAM, estrang'd in look and alterd stile,\r\n  Speech intermitted thus to EVE renewd.\r\n\r\n    Would thou hadst heark'nd to my words, & stai'd\r\n  With me, as I besought thee, when that strange\r\n  Desire of wandring this unhappie Morn,\r\n  I know not whence possessd thee; we had then\r\n  Remaind still happie, not as now, despoild\r\n  Of all our good, sham'd, naked, miserable.\r\n  Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve\r\n  The Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek\r\n  Such proof, conclude, they then begin to faile.\r\n\r\n    To whom soon mov'd with touch of blame thus EVE.\r\n  What words have past thy Lips, ADAM severe,\r\n  Imput'st thou that to my default, or will\r\n  Of wandering, as thou call'st it, which who knows\r\n  But might as ill have happ'nd thou being by,\r\n  Or to thy self perhaps: hadst thou bin there,\r\n  Or bere th' attempt, thou couldst not have discernd\r\n  Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake;\r\n  No ground of enmitie between us known,\r\n  Why hee should mean me ill, or seek to harme.\r\n  Was I to have never parted from thy side?\r\n  As good have grown there still a liveless Rib.\r\n  Being as I am, why didst not thou the Head\r\n  Command me absolutely not to go,\r\n  Going into such danger as thou saidst?\r\n  Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay,\r\n  Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss.\r\n  Hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent,\r\n  Neither had I transgress'd, nor thou with mee.\r\n\r\n    To whom then first incenst ADAM repli'd.\r\n  Is this the Love, is the recompence\r\n  Of mine to thee, ingrateful EVE, exprest\r\n  Immutable when thou wert lost, not I,\r\n  Who might have liv'd and joyd immortal bliss,\r\n  Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee:\r\n  And am I now upbraided, as the cause\r\n  Of thy transgressing? not enough severe,\r\n  It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more?\r\n  I warn'd thee, I admonish'd thee, foretold\r\n  The danger, and the lurking Enemie\r\n  That lay in wait; beyond this had bin force,\r\n  And force upon free Will hath here no place.\r\n  But confidence then bore thee on, secure\r\n  Either to meet no danger, or to finde\r\n  Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps\r\n  I also err'd in overmuch admiring\r\n  What seemd in thee so perfet, that I thought\r\n  No evil durst attempt thee, but I rue\r\n  That errour now, which is become my crime,\r\n  And thou th' accuser.  Thus it shall befall\r\n  Him who to worth in Women overtrusting\r\n  Lets her Will rule; restraint she will not brook,\r\n  And left to her self, if evil thence ensue,\r\n  Shee first his weak indulgence will accuse.\r\n\r\n    Thus they in mutual accusation spent\r\n  The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning\r\n  And of thir vain contest appeer'd no end.\r\n\r\n       THE END OF THE EIGHTH BOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PARADISE LOST\r\n\r\n  BOOK IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Meanwhile the hainous and despightfull act\r\n  Of SATAN done in Paradise, and how\r\n  Hee in the Serpent had perverted EVE,\r\n  Her Husband shee, to taste the fatall fruit,\r\n  Was known in Heav'n; for what can scape the Eye\r\n  Of God All-seeing, or deceave his Heart\r\n  Omniscient, who in all things wise and just,\r\n  Hinder'd not SATAN to attempt the minde\r\n  Of Man, with strength entire, and free Will arm'd,\r\n  Complete to have discover'd and repulst\r\n  Whatever wiles of Foe or seeming Friend.\r\n  For still they knew, and ought to have still remember'd\r\n  The high Injunction not to taste that Fruit,\r\n  Whoever tempted; which they not obeying,\r\n  Incurr'd, what could they less, the penaltie,\r\n  And manifold in sin, deserv'd to fall.\r\n  Up into Heav'n from Paradise in hast\r\n  Th' Angelic Guards ascended, mute and sad\r\n  For Man, for of his state by this they knew,\r\n  Much wondring how the suttle Fiend had stoln\r\n  Entrance unseen.  Soon as th' unwelcome news\r\n  From Earth arriv'd at Heaven Gate, displeas'd\r\n  All were who heard, dim sadness did not spare\r\n  That time Celestial visages, yet mixt\r\n  With pitie, violated not thir bliss.\r\n  About the new-arriv'd, in multitudes\r\n  Th' ethereal People ran, to hear and know\r\n  How all befell: they towards the Throne Supream\r\n  Accountable made haste to make appear\r\n  With righteous plea, thir utmost vigilance,\r\n  And easily approv'd; when the most High\r\n  Eternal Father from his secret Cloud,\r\n  Amidst in Thunder utter'd thus his voice.\r\n\r\n    Assembl'd Angels, and ye Powers return'd\r\n  From unsuccessful charge, be not dismaid,\r\n  Nor troubl'd at these tidings from the Earth,\r\n  Which your sincerest care could not prevent,\r\n  Foretold so lately what would come to pass,\r\n  When first this Tempter cross'd the Gulf from Hell.\r\n  I told ye then he should prevail and speed\r\n  On his bad Errand, Man should be seduc't\r\n  And flatter'd out of all, believing lies\r\n  Against his Maker; no Decree of mine\r\n  Concurring to necessitate his Fall,\r\n  Or touch with lightest moment of impulse\r\n  His free Will, to her own inclining left\r\n  In eevn scale.  But fall'n he is, and now\r\n  What rests, but that the mortal Sentence pass\r\n  On his transgression, Death denounc't that day,\r\n  Which he presumes already vain and void,\r\n  Because not yet inflicted, as he fear'd,\r\n  By some immediate stroak; but soon shall find\r\n  Forbearance no acquittance ere day end.\r\n  Justice shall not return as bountie scorn'd.\r\n  But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee\r\n  Vicegerent Son, to thee I have transferr'd\r\n  All Judgement, whether in Heav'n, or Earth; or Hell.\r\n  Easie it may be seen that I intend\r\n  Mercie collegue with Justice, sending thee\r\n  Mans Friend, his Mediator, his design'd\r\n  Both Ransom and Redeemer voluntarie,\r\n  And destin'd Man himself to judge Man fall'n.\r\n\r\n    So spake the Father, and unfoulding bright\r\n  Toward the right hand his Glorie, on the Son\r\n  Blaz'd forth unclouded Deitie; he full\r\n  Resplendent all his Father manifest\r\n  Express'd, and thus divinely answer'd milde.\r\n\r\n    Father Eternal, thine is to decree,\r\n  Mine both in Heav'n and Earth to do thy will\r\n  Supream, that thou in mee thy Son belov'd\r\n  Mayst ever rest well pleas'd.  I go to judge\r\n  On Earth these thy transgressors, but thou knowst,\r\n  Whoever judg'd, the worst on mee must light,\r\n  When time shall be, for so I undertook\r\n  Before thee; and not repenting, this obtaine\r\n  Of right, that I may mitigate thir doom\r\n  On me deriv'd, yet I shall temper so\r\n  Justice with Mercie, as may illustrate most\r\n  Them fully satisfied, and thee appease.\r\n  Attendance none shall need, nor Train, where none\r\n  Are to behold the Judgement, but the judg'd,\r\n  Those two; the third best absent is condemn'd,\r\n  Convict by flight, and Rebel to all Law\r\n  Conviction to the Serpent none belongs.\r\n\r\n    Thus saying, from his radiant Seat he rose\r\n  Of high collateral glorie: him Thrones and Powers,\r\n  Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant\r\n  Accompanied to Heaven Gate, from whence\r\n  EDEN and all the Coast in prospect lay.\r\n  Down he descended strait; the speed of Gods\r\n  Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes wing'd.\r\n  Now was the Sun in Western cadence low\r\n  From Noon, and gentle Aires due at thir hour\r\n  To fan the Earth now wak'd, and usher in\r\n  The Eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole\r\n  Came the mild Judge and Intercessor both\r\n  To sentence Man: the voice of God they heard\r\n  Now walking in the Garden, by soft windes\r\n  Brought to thir Ears, while day declin'd, they heard\r\n  And from his presence hid themselves among\r\n  The thickest Trees, both Man and Wife, till God\r\n  Approaching, thus to ADAM call'd aloud.\r\n\r\n    Where art thou ADAM, wont with joy to meet\r\n  My coming seen far off?  I miss thee here,\r\n  Not pleas'd, thus entertaind with solitude,\r\n  Where obvious dutie erewhile appear'd unsaught:\r\n  Or come I less conspicuous, or what change\r\n  Absents thee, or what chance detains?  Come forth.\r\n  He came, and with him EVE, more loth, though first\r\n  To offend, discount'nanc't both, and discompos'd;\r\n  Love was not in thir looks, either to God\r\n  Or to each other, but apparent guilt,\r\n  And shame, and perturbation, and despaire,\r\n  Anger, and obstinacie, and hate, and guile.\r\n  Whence ADAM faultring long, thus answer'd brief.\r\n\r\n    I heard thee in the Garden, and of thy voice\r\n  Affraid, being naked, hid my self.  To whom\r\n  The gracious Judge without revile repli'd.\r\n\r\n    My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not fear'd,\r\n  But still rejoyc't, how is it now become\r\n  So dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, who\r\n  Hath told thee? hast thou eaten of the Tree\r\n  Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?\r\n\r\n    To whom thus ADAM sore beset repli'd.\r\n  O Heav'n! in evil strait this day I stand\r\n  Before my Judge, either to undergoe\r\n  My self the total Crime, or to accuse\r\n  My other self, the partner of my life;\r\n  Whose failing, while her Faith to me remaines,\r\n  I should conceal, and not expose to blame\r\n  By my complaint; but strict necessitie\r\n  Subdues me, and calamitous constraint,\r\n  Least on my head both sin and punishment,\r\n  However insupportable, be all\r\n  Devolv'd; though should I hold my peace, yet thou\r\n  Wouldst easily detect what I conceale.\r\n  This Woman whom thou mad'st to be my help,\r\n  And gav'st me as thy perfet gift, so good,\r\n  So fit, so acceptable, so Divine,\r\n  That from her hand I could suspect no ill,\r\n  And what she did, whatever in it self,\r\n  Her doing seem'd to justifie the deed;\r\n  Shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate.\r\n\r\n    To whom the sovran Presence thus repli'd.\r\n  Was shee thy God, that her thou didst obey\r\n  Before his voice, or was shee made thy guide,\r\n  Superior, or but equal, that to her\r\n  Thou did'st resigne thy Manhood, and the Place\r\n  Wherein God set thee above her made of thee,\r\n  And for thee, whose perfection farr excell'd\r\n  Hers in all real dignitie: Adornd\r\n  She was indeed, and lovely to attract\r\n  Thy Love, not thy Subjection, and her Gifts\r\n  Were such as under Government well seem'd,\r\n  Unseemly to beare rule, which was thy part\r\n  And person, had'st thou known thy self aright.\r\n\r\n    So having said, he thus to EVE in few:\r\n  Say Woman, what is this which thou hast done?\r\n\r\n    To whom sad EVE with shame nigh overwhelm'd,\r\n  Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge\r\n  Bold or loquacious, thus abasht repli'd.\r\n\r\n    The Serpent me beguil'd and I did eate.\r\n\r\n    Which when the Lord God heard, without delay\r\n  To Judgement he proceeded on th' accus'd\r\n  Serpent though brute, unable to transferre\r\n  The Guilt on him who made him instrument\r\n  Of mischief, and polluted from the end\r\n  Of his Creation; justly then accurst,\r\n  As vitiated in Nature: more to know\r\n  Concern'd not Man (since he no further knew)\r\n  Nor alter'd his offence; yet God at last\r\n  To Satan first in sin his doom apply'd,\r\n  Though in mysterious terms, judg'd as then best:\r\n  And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall.\r\n\r\n    Because thou hast done this, thou art accurst\r\n  Above all Cattel, each Beast of the Field;\r\n  Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe,\r\n  And dust shalt eat all the days of thy Life.\r\n  Between Thee and the Woman I will put\r\n  Enmitie, and between thine and her Seed;\r\n  Her Seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel.\r\n\r\n    So spake this Oracle, then verifi'd\r\n  When JESUS son of MARY second EVE,\r\n  Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav'n,\r\n  Prince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave\r\n  Spoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht\r\n  In open shew, and with ascention bright\r\n  Captivity led captive through the Aire,\r\n  The Realme it self of Satan long usurpt,\r\n  Whom he shall tread at last under our feet;\r\n  Eevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise,\r\n  And to the Woman thus his Sentence turn'd.\r\n\r\n    Thy sorrow I will greatly multiplie\r\n  By thy Conception; Children thou shalt bring\r\n  In sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands will\r\n  Thine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule.\r\n\r\n    On ADAM last thus judgement he pronounc'd.\r\n  Because thou hast heark'nd to the voice of thy Wife,\r\n  And eaten of the Tree concerning which\r\n  I charg'd thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof,\r\n  Curs'd is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow\r\n  Shalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life;\r\n  Thornes also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth\r\n  Unbid, and thou shalt eate th' Herb of th' Field,\r\n  In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eate Bread,\r\n  Till thou return unto the ground, for thou\r\n  Out of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth,\r\n  For dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne.\r\n\r\n     So judg'd he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent,\r\n  And th' instant stroke of Death denounc't that day\r\n  Remov'd farr off; then pittying how they stood\r\n  Before him naked to the aire, that now\r\n  Must suffer change, disdain'd not to begin\r\n  Thenceforth the forme of servant to assume,\r\n  As when he wash'd his servants feet, so now\r\n  As Father of his Familie he clad\r\n  Thir nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain,\r\n  Or as the Snake with youthful Coate repaid;\r\n  And thought not much to cloath his Enemies:\r\n  Nor hee thir outward onely with the Skins\r\n  Of Beasts, but inward nakedness, much more\r\n  Opprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness,\r\n  Araying cover'd from his Fathers sight.\r\n  To him with swift ascent he up returnd,\r\n  Into his blissful bosom reassum'd\r\n  In glory as of old, to him appeas'd\r\n  All, though all-knowing, what had past with Man\r\n  Recounted, mixing intercession sweet.\r\n  Meanwhile ere thus was sin'd and judg'd on Earth,\r\n  Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death,\r\n  In counterview within the Gates, that now\r\n  Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame\r\n  Farr into CHAOS, since the Fiend pass'd through,\r\n  Sin opening, who thus now to Death began.\r\n\r\n    O Son, why sit we here each other viewing\r\n  Idlely, while Satan our great Author thrives\r\n  In other Worlds, and happier Seat provides\r\n  For us his ofspring deare?  It cannot be\r\n  But that success attends him; if mishap,\r\n  Ere this he had return'd, with fury driv'n\r\n  By his Avenger, since no place like this\r\n  Can fit his punishment, or their revenge.\r\n  Methinks I feel new strength within me rise,\r\n  Wings growing, and Dominion giv'n me large\r\n  Beyond this Deep; whatever drawes me on,\r\n  Or sympathie, or som connatural force\r\n  Powerful at greatest distance to unite\r\n  With secret amity things of like kinde\r\n  By secretest conveyance.  Thou my Shade\r\n  Inseparable must with mee along:\r\n  For Death from Sin no power can separate.\r\n  But least the difficultie of passing back\r\n  Stay his returne perhaps over this Gulfe\r\n  Impassable, impervious, let us try\r\n  Adventrous work, yet to thy power and mine\r\n  Not unagreeable, to found a path\r\n  Over this Maine from Hell to that new World\r\n  Where Satan now prevailes, a Monument\r\n  Of merit high to all th' infernal Host,\r\n  Easing thir passage hence, for intercourse,\r\n  Or transmigration, as thir lot shall lead.\r\n  Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn\r\n  By this new felt attraction and instinct.\r\n\r\n    Whom thus the meager Shadow answerd soon.\r\n  Goe whither Fate and inclination strong\r\n  Leads thee, I shall not lag behinde, nor erre\r\n  The way, thou leading, such a sent I draw\r\n  Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste\r\n  The savour of Death from all things there that live:\r\n  Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest\r\n  Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid.\r\n\r\n    So saying, with delight he snuff'd the smell\r\n  Of mortal change on Earth.  As when a flock\r\n  Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote,\r\n  Against the day of Battel, to a Field,\r\n  Where Armies lie encampt, come flying, lur'd\r\n  With sent of living Carcasses design'd\r\n  For death, the following day, in bloodie fight.\r\n  So sented the grim Feature, and upturn'd\r\n  His Nostril wide into the murkie Air,\r\n  Sagacious of his Quarrey from so farr.\r\n  Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste\r\n  Wide Anarchie of CHAOS damp and dark\r\n  Flew divers, & with Power (thir Power was great)\r\n  Hovering upon the Waters; what they met\r\n  Solid or slimie, as in raging Sea\r\n  Tost up and down, together crowded drove\r\n  From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell.\r\n  As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse\r\n  Upon the CRONIAN Sea, together drive\r\n  Mountains of Ice, that stop th' imagin'd way\r\n  Beyond PETSORA Eastward, to the rich\r\n  CATHAIAN Coast.  The aggregated Soyle\r\n  Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry,\r\n  As with a Trident smote, and fix't as firm\r\n  As DELOS floating once; the rest his look\r\n  Bound with GORGONIAN rigor not to move,\r\n  And with ASPHALTIC slime; broad as the Gate,\r\n  Deep to the Roots of Hell the gather'd beach\r\n  They fasten'd, and the Mole immense wraught on\r\n  Over the foaming deep high Archt, a Bridge\r\n  Of length prodigious joyning to the Wall\r\n  Immoveable of this now fenceless world\r\n  Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad,\r\n  Smooth, easie, inoffensive down to Hell.\r\n  So, if great things to small may be compar'd,\r\n  XERXES, the Libertie of GREECE to yoke,\r\n  From SUSA his MEMNONIAN Palace high\r\n  Came to the Sea, and over HELLESPONT\r\n  Bridging his way, EUROPE with ASIA joyn'd,\r\n  And scourg'd with many a stroak th' indignant waves.\r\n  Now had they brought the work by wondrous Art\r\n  Pontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock\r\n  Over the vext Abyss, following the track\r\n  Of SATAN, to the selfsame place where hee\r\n  First lighted from his Wing, and landed safe\r\n  From out of CHAOS to the outside bare\r\n  Of this round World: with Pinns of Adamant\r\n  And Chains they made all fast, too fast they made\r\n  And durable; and now in little space\r\n  The Confines met of Empyrean Heav'n\r\n  And of this World, and on the left hand Hell\r\n  With long reach interpos'd; three sev'ral wayes\r\n  In sight, to each of these three places led.\r\n  And now thir way to Earth they had descri'd,\r\n  To Paradise first tending, when behold\r\n  SATAN in likeness of an Angel bright\r\n  Betwixt the CENTAURE and the SCORPION stearing\r\n  His ZENITH, while the Sun in ARIES rose:\r\n  Disguis'd he came, but those his Children dear\r\n  Thir Parent soon discern'd, though in disguise.\r\n  Hee, after EVE seduc't, unminded slunk\r\n  Into the Wood fast by, and changing shape\r\n  To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act\r\n  By EVE, though all unweeting, seconded\r\n  Upon her Husband, saw thir shame that sought\r\n  Vain covertures; but when he saw descend\r\n  The Son of God to judge them, terrifi'd\r\n  Hee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun\r\n  The present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth\r\n  Might suddenly inflict; that past, return'd\r\n  By Night, and listning where the hapless Paire\r\n  Sate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint,\r\n  Thence gatherd his own doom, which understood\r\n  Not instant, but of future time.  With joy\r\n  And tidings fraught, to Hell he now return'd,\r\n  And at the brink of CHAOS, neer the foot\r\n  Of this new wondrous Pontifice, unhop't\r\n  Met who to meet him came, his Ofspring dear.\r\n  Great joy was at thir meeting, and at sight\r\n  Of that stupendious Bridge his joy encreas'd.\r\n  Long hee admiring stood, till Sin, his faire\r\n  Inchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke.\r\n\r\n    O Parent, these are thy magnific deeds,\r\n  Thy Trophies, which thou view'st as not thine own,\r\n  Thou art thir Author and prime Architect:\r\n  For I no sooner in my Heart divin'd,\r\n  My Heart, which by a secret harmonie\r\n  Still moves with thine, joyn'd in connexion sweet,\r\n  That thou on Earth hadst prosper'd, which thy looks\r\n  Now also evidence, but straight I felt\r\n  Though distant from thee Worlds between, yet felt\r\n  That I must after thee with this thy Son;\r\n  Such fatal consequence unites us three:\r\n  Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds,\r\n  Nor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure\r\n  Detain from following thy illustrious track.\r\n  Thou hast atchiev'd our libertie, confin'd\r\n  Within Hell Gates till now, thou us impow'rd\r\n  To fortifie thus farr, and overlay\r\n  With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss.\r\n  Thine now is all this World, thy vertue hath won\r\n  What thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gain'd\r\n  With odds what Warr hath lost, and fully aveng'd\r\n  Our foile in Heav'n; here thou shalt Monarch reign,\r\n  There didst not; there let him still Victor sway,\r\n  As Battel hath adjudg'd, from this new World\r\n  Retiring, by his own doom alienated,\r\n  And henceforth Monarchie with thee divide\r\n  Of all things, parted by th' Empyreal bounds,\r\n  His Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World,\r\n  Or trie thee now more dang'rous to his Throne.\r\n\r\n    Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answerd glad.\r\n  Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both,\r\n  High proof ye now have giv'n to be the Race\r\n  Of SATAN (for I glorie in the name,\r\n  Antagonist of Heav'ns Almightie King)\r\n  Amply have merited of me, of all\r\n  Th' Infernal Empire, that so neer Heav'ns dore\r\n  Triumphal with triumphal act have met,\r\n  Mine with this glorious Work, & made one Realm\r\n  Hell and this World, one Realm, one Continent\r\n  Of easie thorough-fare.  Therefore while I\r\n  Descend through Darkness, on your Rode with ease\r\n  To my associate Powers, them to acquaint\r\n  With these successes, and with them rejoyce,\r\n  You two this way, among those numerous Orbs\r\n  All yours, right down to Paradise descend;\r\n  There dwell & Reign in bliss, thence on the Earth\r\n  Dominion exercise and in the Aire,\r\n  Chiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declar'd,\r\n  Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill.\r\n  My Substitutes I send ye, and Create\r\n  Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might\r\n  Issuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now\r\n  My hold of this new Kingdom all depends,\r\n  Through Sin to Death expos'd by my exploit.\r\n  If your joynt power prevaile, th' affaires of Hell\r\n  No detriment need feare, goe and be strong.\r\n\r\n    So saying he dismiss'd them, they with speed\r\n  Thir course through thickest Constellations held\r\n  Spreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan,\r\n  And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips\r\n  Then sufferd.  Th' other way SATAN went down\r\n  The Causey to Hell Gate; on either side\r\n  Disparted CHAOS over built exclaimd,\r\n  And with rebounding surge the barrs assaild,\r\n  That scorn'd his indignation: through the Gate,\r\n  Wide open and unguarded, SATAN pass'd,\r\n  And all about found desolate; for those\r\n  Appointed to sit there, had left thir charge,\r\n  Flown to the upper World; the rest were all\r\n  Farr to the inland retir'd, about the walls\r\n  Of PANDEMONIUM, Citie and proud seate\r\n  Of LUCIFER, so by allusion calld,\r\n  Of that bright Starr to SATAN paragond.\r\n  There kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand\r\n  In Council sate, sollicitous what chance\r\n  Might intercept thir Emperour sent, so hee\r\n  Departing gave command, and they observ'd.\r\n  As when the TARTAR from his RUSSIAN Foe\r\n  By ASTRACAN over the Snowie Plaines\r\n  Retires, or BACTRIAN Sophi from the hornes\r\n  Of TURKISH Crescent, leaves all waste beyond\r\n  The Realme of ALADULE, in his retreate\r\n  To TAURIS or CASBEEN.  So these the late\r\n  Heav'n-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell\r\n  Many a dark League, reduc't in careful Watch\r\n  Round thir Metropolis, and now expecting\r\n  Each hour their great adventurer from the search\r\n  Of Forrein Worlds: he through the midst unmarkt,\r\n  In shew plebeian Angel militant\r\n  Of lowest order, past; and from the dore\r\n  Of that PLUTONIAN Hall, invisible\r\n  Ascended his high Throne, which under state\r\n  Of richest texture spred, at th' upper end\r\n  Was plac't in regal lustre.  Down a while\r\n  He sate, and round about him saw unseen:\r\n  At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head\r\n  And shape Starr bright appeer'd, or brighter, clad\r\n  With what permissive glory since his fall\r\n  Was left him, or false glitter: All amaz'd\r\n  At that so sudden blaze the STYGIAN throng\r\n  Bent thir aspect, and whom they wish'd beheld,\r\n  Thir mighty Chief returnd: loud was th' acclaime:\r\n  Forth rush'd in haste the great consulting Peers,\r\n  Rais'd from thir dark DIVAN, and with like joy\r\n  Congratulant approach'd him, who with hand\r\n  Silence, and with these words attention won.\r\n\r\n    Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,\r\n  For in possession such, not onely of right,\r\n  I call ye and declare ye now, returnd\r\n  Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth\r\n  Triumphant out of this infernal Pit\r\n  Abominable, accurst, the house of woe,\r\n  And Dungeon of our Tyrant: Now possess,\r\n  As Lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven\r\n  Little inferiour, by my adventure hard\r\n  With peril great atchiev'd.  Long were to tell\r\n  What I have don, what sufferd, with what paine\r\n  Voyag'd the unreal, vast, unbounded deep\r\n  Of horrible confusion, over which\r\n  By Sin and Death a broad way now is pav'd\r\n  To expedite your glorious march; but I\r\n  Toild out my uncouth passage, forc't to ride\r\n  Th' untractable Abysse, plung'd in the womb\r\n  Of unoriginal NIGHT and CHAOS wilde,\r\n  That jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos'd\r\n  My journey strange, with clamorous uproare\r\n  Protesting Fate supreame; thence how I found\r\n  The new created World, which fame in Heav'n\r\n  Long had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful\r\n  Of absolute perfection, therein Man\r\n  Plac't in a Paradise, by our exile\r\n  Made happie: Him by fraud I have seduc'd\r\n  From his Creator, and the more to increase\r\n  Your wonder, with an Apple; he thereat\r\n  Offended, worth your laughter, hath giv'n up\r\n  Both his beloved Man and all his World,\r\n  To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us,\r\n  Without our hazard, labour or allarme,\r\n  To range in, and to dwell, and over Man\r\n  To rule, as over all he should have rul'd.\r\n  True is, mee also he hath judg'd, or rather\r\n  Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape\r\n  Man I deceav'd: that which to mee belongs,\r\n  Is enmity, which he will put between\r\n  Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel;\r\n  His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head:\r\n  A World who would not purchase with a bruise,\r\n  Or much more grievous pain?  Ye have th' account\r\n  Of my performance: What remaines, ye Gods,\r\n  But up and enter now into full bliss.\r\n\r\n    So having said, a while he stood, expecting\r\n  Thir universal shout and high applause\r\n  To fill his eare, when contrary he hears\r\n  On all sides, from innumerable tongues\r\n  A dismal universal hiss, the sound\r\n  Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long\r\n  Had leasure, wondring at himself now more;\r\n  His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare,\r\n  His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining\r\n  Each other, till supplanted down he fell\r\n  A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone,\r\n  Reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power\r\n  Now rul'd him, punisht in the shape he sin'd,\r\n  According to his doom: he would have spoke,\r\n  But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue\r\n  To forked tongue, for now were all transform'd\r\n  Alike, to Serpents all as accessories\r\n  To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din\r\n  Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now\r\n  With complicated monsters, head and taile,\r\n  Scorpion and Asp, and AMPHISBAENA dire,\r\n  CERASTES hornd, HYDRUS, and ELLOPS drear,\r\n  And DIPSAS (Not so thick swarm'd once the Soil\r\n  Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle\r\n  OPHIUSA) but still greatest hee the midst,\r\n  Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun\r\n  Ingenderd in the PYTHIAN Vale on slime,\r\n  Huge PYTHON, and his Power no less he seem'd\r\n  Above the rest still to retain; they all\r\n  Him follow'd issuing forth to th' open Field,\r\n  Where all yet left of that revolted Rout\r\n  Heav'n-fall'n, in station stood or just array,\r\n  Sublime with expectation when to see\r\n  In Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief;\r\n  They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd\r\n  Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell,\r\n  And horrid sympathie; for what they saw,\r\n  They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms,\r\n  Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast,\r\n  And the dire hiss renew'd, and the dire form\r\n  Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment,\r\n  As in thir crime.  Thus was th' applause they meant,\r\n  Turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame\r\n  Cast on themselves from thir own mouths.  There stood\r\n  A Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change,\r\n  His will who reigns above, to aggravate\r\n  Thir penance, laden with fair Fruit, like that\r\n  VVhich grew in Paradise, the bait of EVE\r\n  Us'd by the Tempter: on that prospect strange\r\n  Thir earnest eyes they fix'd, imagining\r\n  For one forbidden Tree a multitude\r\n  Now ris'n, to work them furder woe or shame;\r\n  Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce,\r\n  Though to delude them sent, could not abstain,\r\n  But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees\r\n  Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks\r\n  That curld MEGAERA: greedily they pluck'd\r\n  The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew\r\n  Neer that bituminous Lake where SODOM flam'd;\r\n  This more delusive, not the touch, but taste\r\n  Deceav'd; they fondly thinking to allay\r\n  Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit\r\n  Chewd bitter Ashes, which th' offended taste\r\n  VVith spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd,\r\n  Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft,\r\n  VVith hatefullest disrelish writh'd thir jaws\r\n  VVith foot and cinders fill'd; so oft they fell\r\n  Into the same illusion, not as Man\r\n  Whom they triumph'd once lapst.  Thus were they plagu'd\r\n  And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss,\r\n  Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum'd,\r\n  Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo\r\n  This annual humbling certain number'd days,\r\n  To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc't.\r\n  However some tradition they dispers'd\r\n  Among the Heathen of thir purchase got,\r\n  And Fabl'd how the Serpent, whom they calld\r\n  OPHION with EURYNOME, the wide-\r\n  Encroaching EVE perhaps, had first the rule\r\n  Of high OLYMPUS, thence by SATURN driv'n\r\n  And OPS, ere yet DICTAEAN JOVE was born.\r\n  Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair\r\n  Too soon arriv'd, SIN there in power before,\r\n  Once actual, now in body, and to dwell\r\n  Habitual habitant; behind her DEATH\r\n  Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet\r\n  On his pale Horse: to whom SIN thus began.\r\n\r\n    Second of SATAN sprung, all conquering Death,\r\n  What thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd\r\n  With travail difficult, not better farr\r\n  Then stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch,\r\n  Unnam'd, undreaded, and thy self half starv'd?\r\n\r\n    Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answerd soon.\r\n  To mee, who with eternal Famin pine,\r\n  Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven,\r\n  There best, where most with ravin I may meet;\r\n  Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems\r\n  To stuff this Maw, this vast unhide-bound Corps.\r\n\r\n    To whom th' incestuous Mother thus repli'd.\r\n  Thou therefore on these Herbs, and Fruits, & Flours\r\n  Feed first, on each Beast next, and Fish, and Fowle,\r\n  No homely morsels, and whatever thing\r\n  The Sithe of Time mowes down, devour unspar'd,\r\n  Till I in Man residing through the Race,\r\n  His thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect,\r\n  And season him thy last and sweetest prey.\r\n\r\n    This said, they both betook them several wayes,\r\n  Both to destroy, or unimmortal make\r\n  All kinds, and for destruction to mature\r\n  Sooner or later; which th' Almightie seeing,\r\n  From his transcendent Seat the Saints among,\r\n  To those bright Orders utterd thus his voice.\r\n\r\n    See with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance\r\n  To waste and havoc yonder VVorld, which I\r\n  So fair and good created, and had still\r\n  Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man\r\n  Let in these wastful Furies, who impute\r\n  Folly to mee, so doth the Prince of Hell\r\n  And his Adherents, that with so much ease\r\n  I suffer them to enter and possess\r\n  A place so heav'nly, and conniving seem\r\n  To gratifie my scornful Enemies,\r\n  That laugh, as if transported with some fit\r\n  Of Passion, I to them had quitted all,\r\n  At random yeilded up to their misrule;\r\n  And know not that I call'd and drew them thither\r\n  My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth\r\n  Which mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed\r\n  On what was pure, till cramm'd and gorg'd, nigh burst\r\n  With suckt and glutted offal, at one fling\r\n  Of thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son,\r\n  Both SIN, and DEATH, and yawning GRAVE at last\r\n  Through CHAOS hurld, obstruct the mouth of Hell\r\n  For ever, and seal up his ravenous Jawes.\r\n  Then Heav'n and Earth renewd shall be made pure\r\n  To sanctitie that shall receive no staine:\r\n  Till then the Curse pronounc't on both precedes.\r\n\r\n    Hee ended, and the heav'nly Audience loud\r\n  Sung HALLELUIA, as the sound of Seas,\r\n  Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways,\r\n  Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works;\r\n  Who can extenuate thee?  Next, to the Son,\r\n  Destin'd restorer of Mankind, by whom\r\n  New Heav'n and Earth shall to the Ages rise,\r\n  Or down from Heav'n descend.  Such was thir song,\r\n  While the Creator calling forth by name\r\n  His mightie Angels gave them several charge,\r\n  As sorted best with present things.  The Sun\r\n  Had first his precept so to move, so shine,\r\n  As might affect the Earth with cold and heat\r\n  Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call\r\n  Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring\r\n  Solstitial summers heat.  To the blanc Moone\r\n  Her office they prescrib'd, to th' other five\r\n  Thir planetarie motions and aspects\r\n  In SEXTILE, SQUARE, and TRINE, and OPPOSITE,\r\n  Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne\r\n  In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt\r\n  Thir influence malignant when to showre,\r\n  Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling,\r\n  Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set\r\n  Thir corners, when with bluster to confound\r\n  Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle\r\n  With terror through the dark Aereal Hall.\r\n  Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse\r\n  The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more\r\n  From the Suns Axle; they with labour push'd\r\n  Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun\r\n  Was bid turn Reines from th' Equinoctial Rode\r\n  Like distant breadth to TAURUS with the Seav'n\r\n  ATLANTICK Sisters, and the SPARTAN Twins\r\n  Up to the TROPIC Crab; thence down amaine\r\n  By LEO and the VIRGIN and the SCALES,\r\n  As deep as CAPRICORNE, to bring in change\r\n  Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring\r\n  Perpetual smil'd on Earth with vernant Flours,\r\n  Equal in Days and Nights, except to those\r\n  Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day\r\n  Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun\r\n  To recompence his distance, in thir sight\r\n  Had rounded still th' HORIZON, and not known\r\n  Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow\r\n  From cold ESTOTILAND, and South as farr\r\n  Beneath MAGELLAN.  At that tasted Fruit\r\n  The Sun, as from THYESTEAN Banquet, turn'd\r\n  His course intended; else how had the World\r\n  Inhabited, though sinless, more then now,\r\n  Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate?\r\n  These changes in the Heav'ns, though slow, produc'd\r\n  Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast,\r\n  Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot,\r\n  Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North\r\n  Of NORUMBEGA, and the SAMOED shoar\r\n  Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice\r\n  And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw,\r\n  BOREAS and CAECIAS and ARGESTES loud\r\n  And THRASCIAS rend the Woods and Seas upturn;\r\n  With adverse blast up-turns them from the South\r\n  NOTUS and AFER black with thundrous Clouds\r\n  From SERRALIONA; thwart of these as fierce\r\n  Forth rush the LEVANT and the PONENT VVindes\r\n  EURUS and ZEPHIR with thir lateral noise,\r\n  SIROCCO, and LIBECCHIO.  Thus began\r\n  Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first\r\n  Daughter of Sin, among th' irrational,\r\n  Death introduc'd through fierce antipathie:\r\n  Beast now with Beast gan war, & Fowle with Fowle,\r\n  And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving,\r\n  Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe\r\n  Of Man, but fled him, or with count'nance grim\r\n  Glar'd on him passing: these were from without\r\n  The growing miseries, which ADAM saw\r\n  Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade,\r\n  To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within,\r\n  And in a troubl'd Sea of passion tost,\r\n  Thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint.\r\n\r\n    O miserable of happie! is this the end\r\n  Of this new glorious World, and mee so late\r\n  The Glory of that Glory, who now becom\r\n  Accurst of blessed, hide me from the face\r\n  Of God, whom to behold was then my highth\r\n  Of happiness: yet well, if here would end\r\n  The miserie, I deserv'd it, and would beare\r\n  My own deservings; but this will not serve;\r\n  All that I eate or drink, or shall beget,\r\n  Is propagated curse.  O voice once heard\r\n  Delightfully, ENCREASE AND MULTIPLY,\r\n  Now death to heare! for what can I encrease\r\n  Or multiplie, but curses on my head?\r\n  Who of all Ages to succeed, but feeling\r\n  The evil on him brought by me, will curse\r\n  My Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure,\r\n  For this we may thank ADAM; but his thanks\r\n  Shall be the execration; so besides\r\n  Mine own that bide upon me, all from mee\r\n  Shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound,\r\n  On mee as on thir natural center light\r\n  Heavie, though in thir place.  O fleeting joyes\r\n  Of Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes!\r\n  Did I request thee, Maker, from my Clay\r\n  To mould me Man, did I sollicite thee\r\n  From darkness to promote me, or here place\r\n  In this delicious Garden? as my Will\r\n  Concurd not to my being, it were but right\r\n  And equal to reduce me to my dust,\r\n  Desirous to resigne, and render back\r\n  All I receav'd, unable to performe\r\n  Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold\r\n  The good I sought not.  To the loss of that,\r\n  Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added\r\n  The sense of endless woes? inexplicable\r\n  Thy Justice seems; yet to say truth, too late,\r\n  I thus contest; then should have been refusd\r\n  Those terms whatever, when they were propos'd:\r\n  Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good,\r\n  Then cavil the conditions? and though God\r\n  Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son\r\n  Prove disobedient, and reprov'd, retort,\r\n  Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not:\r\n  Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee\r\n  That proud excuse? yet him not thy election,\r\n  But Natural necessity begot.\r\n  God made thee of choice his own, and of his own\r\n  To serve him, thy reward was of his grace,\r\n  Thy punishment then justly is at his Will.\r\n  Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair,\r\n  That dust I am, and shall to dust returne:\r\n  O welcom hour whenever! why delayes\r\n  His hand to execute what his Decree\r\n  Fixd on this day? why do I overlive,\r\n  Why am I mockt with death, and length'nd out\r\n  To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet\r\n  Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth\r\n  Insensible, how glad would lay me down\r\n  As in my Mothers lap? there I should rest\r\n  And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more\r\n  Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse\r\n  To mee and to my ofspring would torment me\r\n  With cruel expectation.  Yet one doubt\r\n  Pursues me still, least all I cannot die,\r\n  Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man\r\n  Which God inspir'd, cannot together perish\r\n  With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave,\r\n  Or in some other dismal place, who knows\r\n  But I shall die a living Death?  O thought\r\n  Horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath\r\n  Of Life that sinn'd; what dies but what had life\r\n  And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither.\r\n  All of me then shall die: let this appease\r\n  The doubt, since humane reach no further knows.\r\n  For though the Lord of all be infinite,\r\n  Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so,\r\n  But mortal doom'd.  How can he exercise\r\n  Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end?\r\n  Can he make deathless Death? that were to make\r\n  Strange contradiction, which to God himself\r\n  Impossible is held, as Argument\r\n  Of weakness, not of Power.  Will he, draw out,\r\n  For angers sake, finite to infinite\r\n  In punisht man, to satisfie his rigour\r\n  Satisfi'd never; that were to extend\r\n  His Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law,\r\n  By which all Causes else according still\r\n  To the reception of thir matter act,\r\n  Not to th' extent of thir own Spheare.  But say\r\n  That Death be not one stroak, as I suppos'd,\r\n  Bereaving sense, but endless miserie\r\n  From this day onward, which I feel begun\r\n  Both in me, and without me, and so last\r\n  To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear\r\n  Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution\r\n  On my defensless head; both Death and I\r\n  Am found Eternal, and incorporate both,\r\n  Nor I on my part single, in mee all\r\n  Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie\r\n  That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able\r\n  To waste it all my self, and leave ye none!\r\n  So disinherited how would ye bless\r\n  Me now your Curse!  Ah, why should all mankind\r\n  For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn'd,\r\n  If guiltless?  But from mee what can proceed,\r\n  But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav'd,\r\n  Not to do onely, but to will the same\r\n  With me? how can they acquitted stand\r\n  In sight of God?  Him after all Disputes\r\n  Forc't I absolve: all my evasions vain\r\n  And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still\r\n  But to my own conviction: first and last\r\n  On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring\r\n  Of all corruption, all the blame lights due;\r\n  So might the wrauth, Fond wish! couldst thou support\r\n  That burden heavier then the Earth to bear,\r\n  Then all the world much heavier, though divided\r\n  With that bad Woman?  Thus what thou desir'st,\r\n  And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope\r\n  Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable\r\n  Beyond all past example and future,\r\n  To SATAN onely like both crime and doom.\r\n  O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears\r\n  And horrors hast thou driv'n me; out of which\r\n  I find no way, from deep to deeper plung'd!\r\n\r\n    Thus ADAM to himself lamented loud\r\n  Through the still Night, now now, as ere man fell,\r\n  Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air\r\n  Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom,\r\n  Which to his evil Conscience represented\r\n  All things with double terror: On the ground\r\n  Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft\r\n  Curs'd his Creation, Death as oft accus'd\r\n  Of tardie execution, since denounc't\r\n  The day of his offence.  Why comes not Death,\r\n  Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke\r\n  To end me?  Shall Truth fail to keep her word,\r\n  Justice Divine not hast'n to be just?\r\n  But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine\r\n  Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries.\r\n  O Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowrs,\r\n  VVith other echo farr I taught your Shades\r\n  To answer, and resound farr other Song.\r\n  VVhom thus afflicted when sad EVE beheld,\r\n  Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh,\r\n  Soft words to his fierce passion she assay'd:\r\n  But her with stern regard he thus repell'd.\r\n\r\n    Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best\r\n  Befits thee with him leagu'd, thy self as false\r\n  And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape,\r\n  Like his, and colour Serpentine may shew\r\n  Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee\r\n  Henceforth; least that too heav'nly form, pretended\r\n  To hellish falshood, snare them.  But for thee\r\n  I had persisted happie, had not thy pride\r\n  And wandring vanitie, when lest was safe,\r\n  Rejected my forewarning, and disdain'd\r\n  Not to be trusted, longing to be seen\r\n  Though by the Devil himself, him overweening\r\n  To over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting\r\n  Fool'd and beguil'd, by him thou, I by thee,\r\n  To trust thee from my side, imagin'd wise,\r\n  Constant, mature, proof against all assaults,\r\n  And understood not all was but a shew\r\n  Rather then solid vertu, all but a Rib\r\n  Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears,\r\n  More to the part sinister from me drawn,\r\n  Well if thrown out, as supernumerarie\r\n  To my just number found.  O why did God,\r\n  Creator wise, that peopl'd highest Heav'n\r\n  With Spirits Masculine, create at last\r\n  This noveltie on Earth, this fair defect\r\n  Of Nature, and not fill the World at once\r\n  With Men as Angels without Feminine,\r\n  Or find some other way to generate\r\n  Mankind? this mischief had not then befall'n,\r\n  And more that shall befall, innumerable\r\n  Disturbances on Earth through Femal snares,\r\n  And straight conjunction with this Sex: for either\r\n  He never shall find out fit Mate, but such\r\n  As some misfortune brings him, or mistake,\r\n  Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain\r\n  Through her perverseness, but shall see her gaind\r\n  By a farr worse, or if she love, withheld\r\n  By Parents, or his happiest choice too late\r\n  Shall meet, alreadie linkt and Wedlock-bound\r\n  To a fell Adversarie, his hate or shame:\r\n  Which infinite calamitie shall cause\r\n  To humane life, and houshold peace confound.\r\n\r\n    He added not, and from her turn'd, but EVE\r\n  Not so repulst, with Tears that ceas'd not flowing,\r\n  And tresses all disorderd, at his feet\r\n  Fell humble, and imbracing them, besaught\r\n  His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint.\r\n\r\n    Forsake me not thus, ADAM, witness Heav'n\r\n  What love sincere, and reverence in my heart\r\n  I beare thee, and unweeting have offended,\r\n  Unhappilie deceav'd; thy suppliant\r\n  I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not,\r\n  Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid,\r\n  Thy counsel in this uttermost distress,\r\n  My onely strength and stay: forlorn of thee,\r\n  Whither shall I betake me, where subsist?\r\n  While yet we live, scarse one short hour perhaps,\r\n  Between us two let there be peace, both joyning,\r\n  As joyn'd in injuries, one enmitie\r\n  Against a Foe by doom express assign'd us,\r\n  That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not\r\n  Thy hatred for this miserie befall'n,\r\n  On me already lost, mee then thy self\r\n  More miserable; both have sin'd, but thou\r\n  Against God onely, I against God and thee,\r\n  And to the place of judgement will return,\r\n  There with my cries importune Heaven, that all\r\n  The sentence from thy head remov'd may light\r\n  On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe,\r\n  Mee mee onely just object of his ire.\r\n\r\n    She ended weeping, and her lowlie plight,\r\n  Immoveable till peace obtain'd from fault\r\n  Acknowledg'd and deplor'd, in ADAM wraught\r\n  Commiseration; soon his heart relented\r\n  Towards her, his life so late and sole delight,\r\n  Now at his feet submissive in distress,\r\n  Creature so faire his reconcilement seeking,\r\n  His counsel whom she had displeas'd, his aide;\r\n  As one disarm'd, his anger all he lost,\r\n  And thus with peaceful words uprais'd her soon.\r\n\r\n    Unwarie, and too desirous, as before,\r\n  So now of what thou knowst not, who desir'st\r\n  The punishment all on thy self; alas,\r\n  Beare thine own first, ill able to sustaine\r\n  His full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part,\r\n  And my displeasure bearst so ill.  If Prayers\r\n  Could alter high Decrees, I to that place\r\n  Would speed before thee, and be louder heard,\r\n  That on my head all might be visited,\r\n  Thy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgiv'n,\r\n  To me committed and by me expos'd.\r\n  But rise, let us no more contend, nor blame\r\n  Each other, blam'd enough elsewhere, but strive\r\n  In offices of Love, how we may light'n\r\n  Each others burden in our share of woe;\r\n  Since this days Death denounc't, if ought I see,\r\n  Will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac't evill,\r\n  A long days dying to augment our paine,\r\n  And to our Seed (O hapless Seed!) deriv'd.\r\n\r\n    To whom thus EVE, recovering heart, repli'd.\r\n  ADAM, by sad experiment I know\r\n  How little weight my words with thee can finde,\r\n  Found so erroneous, thence by just event\r\n  Found so unfortunate; nevertheless,\r\n  Restor'd by thee, vile as I am, to place\r\n  Of new acceptance, hopeful to regaine\r\n  Thy Love, the sole contentment of my heart,\r\n  Living or dying from thee I will not hide\r\n  What thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris'n,\r\n  Tending to som relief of our extremes,\r\n  Or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable,\r\n  As in our evils, and of easier choice.\r\n  If care of our descent perplex us most,\r\n  Which must be born to certain woe, devourd\r\n  By Death at last, and miserable it is\r\n  To be to others cause of misery,\r\n  Our own begotten, and of our Loines to bring\r\n  Into this cursed World a woful Race,\r\n  That after wretched Life must be at last\r\n  Food for so foule a Monster, in thy power\r\n  It lies, yet ere Conception to prevent\r\n  The Race unblest, to being yet unbegot.\r\n  Childless thou art, Childless remaine:\r\n  So Death shall be deceav'd his glut, and with us two\r\n  Be forc'd to satisfie his Rav'nous Maw.\r\n  But if thou judge it hard and difficult,\r\n  Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain\r\n  From Loves due Rites, Nuptial embraces sweet,\r\n  And with desire to languish without hope,\r\n  Before the present object languishing\r\n  With like desire, which would be miserie\r\n  And torment less then none of what we dread,\r\n  Then both our selves and Seed at once to free\r\n  From what we fear for both, let us make short,\r\n  Let us seek Death, or hee not found, supply\r\n  With our own hands his Office on our selves;\r\n  Why stand we longer shivering under feares,\r\n  That shew no end but Death, and have the power,\r\n  Of many wayes to die the shortest choosing,\r\n  Destruction with destruction to destroy.\r\n\r\n    She ended heer, or vehement despaire\r\n  Broke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts\r\n  Had entertaind, as di'd her Cheeks with pale.\r\n  But ADAM with such counsel nothing sway'd,\r\n  To better hopes his more attentive minde\r\n  Labouring had rais'd, and thus to EVE repli'd.\r\n\r\n    EVE, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems\r\n  To argue in thee somthing more sublime\r\n  And excellent then what thy minde contemnes;\r\n  But self-destruction therefore saught, refutes\r\n  That excellence thought in thee, and implies,\r\n  Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret\r\n  For loss of life and pleasure overlov'd.\r\n  Or if thou covet death, as utmost end\r\n  Of miserie, so thinking to evade\r\n  The penaltie pronounc't, doubt not but God\r\n  Hath wiselier arm'd his vengeful ire then so\r\n  To be forestall'd; much more I fear least Death\r\n  So snatcht will not exempt us from the paine\r\n  We are by doom to pay; rather such acts\r\n  Of contumacie will provoke the highest\r\n  To make death in us live: Then let us seek\r\n  Som safer resolution, which methinks\r\n  I have in view, calling to minde with heed\r\n  Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise\r\n  The Serpents head; piteous amends, unless\r\n  Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe\r\n  SATAN, who in the Serpent hath contriv'd\r\n  Against us this deceit: to crush his head\r\n  Would be revenge indeed; which will be lost\r\n  By death brought on our selves, or childless days\r\n  Resolv'd, as thou proposest; so our Foe\r\n  Shall scape his punishment ordain'd, and wee\r\n  Instead shall double ours upon our heads.\r\n  No more be mention'd then of violence\r\n  Against our selves, and wilful barrenness,\r\n  That cuts us off from hope, and savours onely\r\n  Rancor and pride, impatience and despite,\r\n  Reluctance against God and his just yoke\r\n  Laid on our Necks.  Remember with what mild\r\n  And gracious temper he both heard and judg'd\r\n  Without wrauth or reviling; wee expected\r\n  Immediate dissolution, which we thought\r\n  Was meant by Death that day, when lo, to thee\r\n  Pains onely in Child-bearing were foretold,\r\n  And bringing forth, soon recompenc't with joy,\r\n  Fruit of thy Womb: On mee the Curse aslope\r\n  Glanc'd on the ground, with labour I must earne\r\n  My bread; what harm?  Idleness had bin worse;\r\n  My labour will sustain me; and least Cold\r\n  Or Heat should injure us, his timely care\r\n  Hath unbesaught provided, and his hands\r\n  Cloath'd us unworthie, pitying while he judg'd;\r\n  How much more, if we pray him, will his ear\r\n  Be open, and his heart to pitie incline,\r\n  And teach us further by what means to shun\r\n  Th' inclement Seasons, Rain, Ice, Hail and Snow,\r\n  Which now the Skie with various Face begins\r\n  To shew us in this Mountain, while the Winds\r\n  Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks\r\n  Of these fair spreading Trees; which bids us seek\r\n  Som better shroud, som better warmth to cherish\r\n  Our Limbs benumm'd, ere this diurnal Starr\r\n  Leave cold the Night, how we his gather'd beams\r\n  Reflected, may with matter sere foment,\r\n  Or by collision of two bodies grinde\r\n  The Air attrite to Fire, as late the Clouds\r\n  Justling or pusht with Winds rude in thir shock\r\n  Tine the slant Lightning, whose thwart flame driv'n down\r\n  Kindles the gummie bark of Firr or Pine,\r\n  And sends a comfortable heat from farr,\r\n  Which might supplie the Sun: such Fire to use,\r\n  And what may else be remedie or cure\r\n  To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought,\r\n  Hee will instruct us praying, and of Grace\r\n  Beseeching him, so as we need not fear\r\n  To pass commodiously this life, sustain'd\r\n  By him with many comforts, till we end\r\n  In dust, our final rest and native home.\r\n  What better can we do, then to the place\r\n  Repairing where he judg'd us, prostrate fall\r\n  Before him reverent, and there confess\r\n  Humbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears\r\n  VVatering the ground, and with our sighs the Air\r\n  Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign\r\n  Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek.\r\n  Undoubtedly he will relent and turn\r\n  From his displeasure; in whose look serene,\r\n  VVhen angry most he seem'd and most severe,\r\n  VVhat else but favor, grace, and mercie shon?\r\n\r\n    So spake our Father penitent, nor EVE\r\n  Felt less remorse: they forthwith to the place\r\n  Repairing where he judg'd them prostrate fell\r\n  Before him reverent, and both confess'd\r\n  Humbly thir faults, and pardon beg'd, with tears\r\n  VVatering the ground, and with thir sighs the Air\r\n  Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign\r\n  Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek.\r\n\r\n       THE END OF THE NINTH BOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PARADISE LOST.\r\n\r\n  BOOK X.\r\n\r\n  Thus they in lowliest plight repentant stood\r\n  Praying, for from the Mercie-seat above\r\n  Prevenient Grace descending had remov'd\r\n  The stonie from thir hearts, and made new flesh\r\n  Regenerat grow instead, that sighs now breath'd\r\n  Unutterable, which the Spirit of prayer\r\n  Inspir'd, and wing'd for Heav'n with speedier flight\r\n  Then loudest Oratorie: yet thir port\r\n  Not of mean suiters, nor important less\r\n  Seem'd thir Petition, then when th' ancient Pair\r\n  In Fables old, less ancient yet then these,\r\n  DEUCALION and chaste PYRRHA to restore\r\n  The Race of Mankind drownd, before the Shrine\r\n  Of THEMIS stood devout.  To Heav'n thir prayers\r\n  Flew up, nor missed the way, by envious windes\r\n  Blow'n vagabond or frustrate: in they passd\r\n  Dimentionless through Heav'nly dores; then clad\r\n  With incense, where the Golden Altar fum'd,\r\n  By thir great Intercessor, came in sight\r\n  Before the Fathers Throne: Them the glad Son\r\n  Presenting, thus to intercede began.\r\n\r\n    See Father, what first fruits on Earth are sprung\r\n  From thy implanted Grace in Man, these Sighs\r\n  And Prayers, which in this Golden Censer, mixt\r\n  With Incense, I thy Priest before thee bring,\r\n  Fruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed\r\n  Sow'n with contrition in his heart, then those\r\n  Which his own hand manuring all the Trees\r\n  Of Paradise could have produc't, ere fall'n\r\n  From innocence.  Now therefore bend thine eare\r\n  To supplication, heare his sighs though mute;\r\n  Unskilful with what words to pray, let mee\r\n  Interpret for him, mee his Advocate\r\n  And propitiation, all his works on mee\r\n  Good or not good ingraft, my Merit those\r\n  Shall perfet, and for these my Death shall pay.\r\n  Accept me, and in mee from these receave\r\n  The smell of peace toward Mankinde, let him live\r\n  Before thee reconcil'd, at least his days\r\n  Numberd, though sad, till Death, his doom (which I\r\n  To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse)\r\n  To better life shall yeeld him, where with mee\r\n  All my redeemd may dwell in joy and bliss,\r\n  Made one with me as I with thee am one.\r\n\r\n    To whom the Father, without Cloud, serene.\r\n  All thy request for Man, accepted Son,\r\n  Obtain, all thy request was my Decree:\r\n  But longer in that Paradise to dwell,\r\n  The Law I gave to Nature him forbids:\r\n  Those pure immortal Elements that know\r\n  No gross, no unharmoneous mixture foule,\r\n  Eject him tainted now, and purge him off\r\n  As a distemper, gross to aire as gross,\r\n  And mortal food, as may dispose him best\r\n  For dissolution wrought by Sin, that first\r\n  Distemperd all things, and of incorrupt\r\n  Corrupted.  I at first with two fair gifts\r\n  Created him endowd, with Happiness\r\n  And Immortalitie: that fondly lost,\r\n  This other serv'd but to eternize woe;\r\n  Till I provided Death; so Death becomes\r\n  His final remedie, and after Life\r\n  Tri'd in sharp tribulation, and refin'd\r\n  By Faith and faithful works, to second Life,\r\n  Wak't in the renovation of the just,\r\n  Resignes him up with Heav'n and Earth renewd.\r\n  But let us call to Synod all the Blest\r\n  Through Heav'ns wide bounds; from them I will not hide\r\n  My judgments, how with Mankind I proceed,\r\n  As how with peccant Angels late they saw;\r\n  And in thir state, though firm, stood more confirmd.\r\n\r\n    He ended, and the Son gave signal high\r\n  To the bright Minister that watchd, hee blew\r\n  His Trumpet, heard in OREB since perhaps\r\n  When God descended, and perhaps once more\r\n  To sound at general Doom.  Th' Angelic blast\r\n  Filld all the Regions: from thir blissful Bowrs\r\n  Of AMARANTIN Shade, Fountain or Spring,\r\n  By the waters of Life, where ere they sate\r\n  In fellowships of joy: the Sons of Light\r\n  Hasted, resorting to the Summons high,\r\n  And took thir Seats; till from his Throne supream\r\n  Th' Almighty thus pronounced his sovran Will.\r\n\r\n    O Sons, like one of us Man is become\r\n  To know both Good and Evil, since his taste\r\n  Of that defended Fruit; but let him boast\r\n  His knowledge of Good lost, and Evil got,\r\n  Happier, had it suffic'd him to have known\r\n  Good by it self, and Evil not at all.\r\n  He sorrows now, repents, and prayes contrite,\r\n  My motions in him, longer then they move,\r\n  His heart I know, how variable and vain\r\n  Self-left.  Least therefore his now bolder hand\r\n  Reach also of the Tree of Life, and eat,\r\n  And live for ever, dream at least to live\r\n  Forever, to remove him I decree,\r\n  And send him from the Garden forth to Till\r\n  The Ground whence he was taken, fitter soile.\r\n\r\n    MICHAEL, this my behest have thou in charge,\r\n  Take to thee from among the Cherubim\r\n  Thy choice of flaming Warriours, least the Fiend\r\n  Or in behalf of Man, or to invade\r\n  Vacant possession som new trouble raise:\r\n  Hast thee, and from the Paradise of God\r\n  Without remorse drive out the sinful Pair,\r\n  From hallowd ground th' unholie, and denounce\r\n  To them and to thir Progenie from thence\r\n  Perpetual banishment.  Yet least they faint\r\n  At the sad Sentence rigorously urg'd,\r\n  For I behold them soft'nd and with tears\r\n  Bewailing thir excess, all terror hide.\r\n  If patiently thy bidding they obey,\r\n  Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveale\r\n  To ADAM what shall come in future dayes,\r\n  As I shall thee enlighten, intermix\r\n  My Cov'nant in the Womans seed renewd;\r\n  So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace:\r\n  And on the East side of the Garden place,\r\n  Where entrance up from EDEN easiest climbes,\r\n  Cherubic watch, and of a Sword the flame\r\n  Wide waving, all approach farr off to fright,\r\n  And guard all passage to the Tree of Life:\r\n  Least Paradise a receptacle prove\r\n  To Spirits foule, and all my Trees thir prey,\r\n  With whose stol'n Fruit Man once more to delude.\r\n\r\n    He ceas'd; and th' Archangelic Power prepar'd\r\n  For swift descent, with him the Cohort bright\r\n  Of watchful Cherubim; four faces each\r\n  Had, like a double JANUS, all thir shape\r\n  Spangl'd with eyes more numerous then those\r\n  Of ARGUS, and more wakeful then to drouze,\r\n  Charm'd with ARCADIAN Pipe, the Pastoral Reed\r\n  Of HERMES, or his opiate Rod.  Meanwhile\r\n  To resalute the World with sacred Light\r\n  LEUCOTHEA wak'd, and with fresh dews imbalmd\r\n  The Earth, when ADAM and first Matron EVE\r\n  Had ended now thir Orisons, and found,\r\n  Strength added from above, new hope to spring\r\n  Out of despaire, joy, but with fear yet linkt;\r\n  Which thus to EVE his welcome words renewd.\r\n\r\n    EVE, easily may Faith admit, that all\r\n  The good which we enjoy, from Heav'n descends\r\n  But that from us ought should ascend to Heav'n\r\n  So prevalent as to concerne the mind\r\n  Of God high blest, or to incline his will,\r\n  Hard to belief may seem; yet this will Prayer,\r\n  Or one short sigh of humane breath, up-borne\r\n  Ev'n to the Seat of God.  For since I saught\r\n  By Prayer th' offended Deitie to appease,\r\n  Kneel'd and before him humbl'd all my heart,\r\n  Methought I saw him placable and mild,\r\n  Bending his eare; perswasion in me grew\r\n  That I was heard with favour; peace returnd\r\n  Home to my brest, and to my memorie\r\n  His promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe;\r\n  Which then not minded in dismay, yet now\r\n  Assures me that the bitterness of death\r\n  Is past, and we shall live.  Whence Haile to thee,\r\n  EVE rightly call'd, Mother of all Mankind,\r\n  Mother of all things living, since by thee\r\n  Man is to live, and all things live for Man.\r\n\r\n    To whom thus EVE with sad demeanour meek.\r\n  Ill worthie I such title should belong\r\n  To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind\r\n  A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach\r\n  Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise:\r\n  But infinite in pardon was my Judge,\r\n  That I who first brought Death on all, am grac't\r\n  The sourse of life; next favourable thou,\r\n  Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf't,\r\n  Farr other name deserving.  But the Field\r\n  To labour calls us now with sweat impos'd,\r\n  Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn,\r\n  All unconcern'd with our unrest, begins\r\n  Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth,\r\n  I never from thy side henceforth to stray,\r\n  Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind\r\n  Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell,\r\n  What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes?\r\n  Here let us live, though in fall'n state, content.\r\n\r\n    So spake, so wish'd much-humbl'd EVE, but Fate\r\n  Subscrib'd not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest\r\n  On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips'd\r\n  After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight\r\n  The Bird of JOVE, stoopt from his aerie tour,\r\n  Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove:\r\n  Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods,\r\n  First Hunter then, pursu'd a gentle brace,\r\n  Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde;\r\n  Direct to th' Eastern Gate was bent thir flight.\r\n  ADAM observ'd, and with his Eye the chase\r\n  Pursuing, not unmov'd to EVE thus spake.\r\n\r\n    O EVE, some furder change awaits us nigh,\r\n  Which Heav'n by these mute signs in Nature shews\r\n  Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn\r\n  Us haply too secure of our discharge\r\n  From penaltie, because from death releast\r\n  Some days; how long, and what till then our life,\r\n  Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust,\r\n  And thither must return and be no more.\r\n  VVhy else this double object in our sight\r\n  Of flight pursu'd in th' Air and ore the ground\r\n  One way the self-same hour? why in the East\r\n  Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light\r\n  More orient in yon VVestern Cloud that draws\r\n  O're the blew Firmament a radiant white,\r\n  And slow descends, with somthing heav'nly fraught.\r\n\r\n    He err'd not, for by this the heav'nly Bands\r\n  Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now\r\n  In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt,\r\n  A glorious Apparition, had not doubt\r\n  And carnal fear that day dimm'd ADAMS eye.\r\n  Not that more glorious, when the Angels met\r\n  JACOB in MAHANAIM, where he saw\r\n  The field Pavilion'd with his Guardians bright;\r\n  Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd\r\n  In DOTHAN, cover'd with a Camp of Fire,\r\n  Against the SYRIAN King, who to surprize\r\n  One man, Assassin-like had levied Warr,\r\n  Warr unproclam'd.  The Princely Hierarch\r\n  In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise\r\n  Possession of the Garden; hee alone,\r\n  To finde where ADAM shelterd, took his way,\r\n  Not unperceav'd of ADAM, who to EVE,\r\n  While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake.\r\n\r\n    EVE, now expect great tidings, which perhaps\r\n  Of us will soon determin, or impose\r\n  New Laws to be observ'd; for I descrie\r\n  From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill\r\n  One of the heav'nly Host, and by his Gate\r\n  None of the meanest, some great Potentate\r\n  Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie\r\n  Invests him coming; yet not terrible,\r\n  That I should fear, nor sociably mild,\r\n  As RAPHAEL, that I should much confide,\r\n  But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend,\r\n  With reverence I must meet, and thou retire.\r\n  He ended; and th' Arch-Angel soon drew nigh,\r\n  Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man\r\n  Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes\r\n  A militarie Vest of purple flowd\r\n  Livelier then MELIBOEAN, or the graine\r\n  Of SARRA, worn by Kings and Hero's old\r\n  In time of Truce; IRIS had dipt the wooff;\r\n  His starrie Helme unbuckl'd shew'd him prime\r\n  In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side\r\n  As in a glistering ZODIAC hung the Sword,\r\n  Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear.\r\n  ADAM bowd low, hee Kingly from his State\r\n  Inclin'd not, but his coming thus declar'd.\r\n\r\n    ADAM, Heav'ns high behest no Preface needs:\r\n  Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death,\r\n  Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress,\r\n  Defeated of his seisure many dayes\r\n  Giv'n thee of Grace, wherein thou may'st repent,\r\n  And one bad act with many deeds well done\r\n  Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas'd\r\n  Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claimes;\r\n  But longer in this Paradise to dwell\r\n  Permits not; to remove thee I am come,\r\n  And send thee from the Garden forth to till\r\n  The ground whence thou wast tak'n, fitter Soile.\r\n\r\n    He added not, for ADAM at the newes\r\n  Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,\r\n  That all his senses bound; EVE, who unseen\r\n  Yet all had heard, with audible lament\r\n  Discover'd soon the place of her retire.\r\n\r\n    O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death!\r\n  Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave\r\n  Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades,\r\n  Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend,\r\n  Quiet though sad, the respit of that day\r\n  That must be mortal to us both.  O flours,\r\n  That never will in other Climate grow,\r\n  My early visitation, and my last\r\n  At Eev'n, which I bred up with tender hand\r\n  From the first op'ning bud, and gave ye Names,\r\n  Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke\r\n  Your Tribes, and water from th' ambrosial Fount?\r\n  Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd\r\n  With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee\r\n  How shall I part, and whither wander down\r\n  Into a lower World, to this obscure\r\n  And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire\r\n  Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits?\r\n\r\n    Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde.\r\n  Lament not EVE, but patiently resigne\r\n  What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart,\r\n  Thus over fond, on that which is not thine;\r\n  Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes\r\n  Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound;\r\n  Where he abides, think there thy native soile.\r\n\r\n    ADAM by this from the cold sudden damp\r\n  Recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd,\r\n  To MICHAEL thus his humble words addressd.\r\n\r\n    Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or nam'd\r\n  Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem\r\n  Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould\r\n  Thy message, which might else in telling wound,\r\n  And in performing end us; what besides\r\n  Of sorrow and dejection and despair\r\n  Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring,\r\n  Departure from this happy place, our sweet\r\n  Recess, and onely consolation left\r\n  Familiar to our eyes, all places else\r\n  Inhospitable appeer and desolate,\r\n  Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer\r\n  Incessant I could hope to change the will\r\n  Of him who all things can, I would not cease\r\n  To wearie him with my assiduous cries:\r\n  But prayer against his absolute Decree\r\n  No more availes then breath against the winde,\r\n  Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth:\r\n  Therefore to his great bidding I submit.\r\n  This most afflicts me, that departing hence,\r\n  As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd\r\n  His blessed count'nance; here I could frequent,\r\n  With worship, place by place where he voutsaf'd\r\n  Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate;\r\n  On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree\r\n  Stood visible, among these Pines his voice\r\n  I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk'd:\r\n  So many grateful Altars I would reare\r\n  Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone\r\n  Of lustre from the brook, in memorie,\r\n  Or monument to Ages, and thereon\r\n  Offer sweet smelling Gumms & Fruits and Flours:\r\n  In yonder nether World where shall I seek\r\n  His bright appearances, or footstep trace?\r\n  For though I fled him angrie, yet recall'd\r\n  To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now\r\n  Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts\r\n  Of glory, and farr off his steps adore.\r\n\r\n    To whom thus MICHAEL with regard benigne.\r\n  ADAM, thou know'st Heav'n his, and all the Earth\r\n  Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills\r\n  Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives,\r\n  Fomented by his virtual power and warmd:\r\n  All th' Earth he gave thee to possess and rule,\r\n  No despicable gift; surmise not then\r\n  His presence to these narrow bounds confin'd\r\n  Of Paradise or EDEN: this had been\r\n  Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred\r\n  All generations, and had hither come\r\n  From all the ends of th' Earth, to celebrate\r\n  And reverence thee thir great Progenitor.\r\n  But this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down\r\n  To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons:\r\n  Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine\r\n  God is as here, and will be found alike\r\n  Present, and of his presence many a signe\r\n  Still following thee, still compassing thee round\r\n  With goodness and paternal Love, his Face\r\n  Express, and of his steps the track Divine.\r\n  Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd,\r\n  Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent\r\n  To shew thee what shall come in future dayes\r\n  To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad\r\n  Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending\r\n  With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn\r\n  True patience, and to temper joy with fear\r\n  And pious sorrow, equally enur'd\r\n  By moderation either state to beare,\r\n  Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead\r\n  Safest thy life, and best prepar'd endure\r\n  Thy mortal passage when it comes.  Ascend\r\n  This Hill; let EVE (for I have drencht her eyes)\r\n  Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st,\r\n  As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd.\r\n\r\n    To whom thus ADAM gratefully repli'd.\r\n  Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path\r\n  Thou lead'st me, and to the hand of Heav'n submit,\r\n  However chast'ning, to the evil turne\r\n  My obvious breast, arming to overcom\r\n  By suffering, and earne rest from labour won,\r\n  If so I may attain.  So both ascend\r\n  In the Visions of God:  It was a Hill\r\n  Of Paradise the highest, from whose top\r\n  The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken\r\n  Stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay.\r\n  Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round,\r\n  Whereon for different cause the Tempter set\r\n  Our second ADAM in the Wilderness,\r\n  To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory.\r\n  His Eye might there command wherever stood\r\n  City of old or modern Fame, the Seat\r\n  Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls\r\n  Of CAMBALU, seat of CATHAIAN CAN\r\n  And SAMARCHAND by OXUS, TEMIRS Throne,\r\n  To PAQUIN of SINAEAN Kings, and thence\r\n  To AGRA and LAHOR of great MOGUL\r\n  Down to the golden CHERSONESE, or where\r\n  The PERSIAN in ECBATAN sate, or since\r\n  In HISPAHAN, or where the RUSSIAN KSAR\r\n  In MOSCO, or the Sultan in BIZANCE,\r\n  TURCHESTAN-born; nor could his eye not ken\r\n  Th' Empire of NEGUS to his utmost Port\r\n  ERCOCO and the less Maritine Kings\r\n  MOMBAZA, and QUILOA, and MELIND,\r\n  And SOFALA thought OPHIR, to the Realme\r\n  Of CONGO, and ANGOLA fardest South;\r\n  Or thence from NIGER Flood to ATLAS Mount\r\n  The Kingdoms of ALMANSOR, FEZ, and SUS,\r\n  MAROCCO and ALGIERS, and TREMISEN;\r\n  On EUROPE thence, and where ROME was to sway\r\n  The VVorld: in Spirit perhaps he also saw\r\n  Rich MEXICO the seat of MOTEZUME,\r\n  And CUSCO in PERU, the richer seat\r\n  Of ATABALIPA, and yet unspoil'd\r\n  GUIANA, whose great Citie GERYONS Sons\r\n  Call EL DORADO: but to nobler sights\r\n  MICHAEL from ADAMS eyes the Filme remov'd\r\n  VVhich that false Fruit that promis'd clearer sight\r\n  Had bred; then purg'd with Euphrasie and Rue\r\n  The visual Nerve, for he had much to see;\r\n  And from the VVell of Life three drops instill'd.\r\n  So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc'd,\r\n  Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight,\r\n  That ADAM now enforc't to close his eyes,\r\n  Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst:\r\n  But him the gentle Angel by the hand\r\n  Soon rais'd, and his attention thus recall'd.\r\n\r\n    ADAM, now ope thine eyes, and first behold\r\n  Th' effects which thy original crime hath wrought\r\n  In some to spring from thee, who never touch'd\r\n  Th' excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir'd,\r\n  Nor sinn'd thy sin, yet from that sin derive\r\n  Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds.\r\n\r\n    His eyes he op'nd, and beheld a field,\r\n  Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves\r\n  New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds;\r\n  Ith' midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood\r\n  Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon\r\n  A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought\r\n  First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf,\r\n  Uncull'd, as came to hand; a Shepherd next\r\n  More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock\r\n  Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid\r\n  The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew'd,\r\n  On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform'd.\r\n  His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav'n\r\n  Consum'd with nimble glance, and grateful steame;\r\n  The others not, for his was not sincere;\r\n  Whereat hee inlie rag'd, and as they talk'd,\r\n  Smote him into the Midriff with a stone\r\n  That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale\r\n  Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus'd.\r\n  Much at that sight was ADAM in his heart\r\n  Dismai'd, and thus in haste to th' Angel cri'd.\r\n\r\n    O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall'n\r\n  To that meek man, who well had sacrific'd;\r\n  Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid?\r\n\r\n    T' whom MICHAEL thus, hee also mov'd, repli'd.\r\n  These two are Brethren, ADAM, and to come\r\n  Out of thy loyns; th' unjust the just hath slain,\r\n  For envie that his Brothers Offering found\r\n  From Heav'n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact\r\n  Will be aveng'd, and th' others Faith approv'd\r\n  Loose no reward, though here thou see him die,\r\n  Rowling in dust and gore.  To which our Sire.\r\n\r\n    Alas, both for the deed and for the cause!\r\n  But have I now seen Death?  Is this the way\r\n  I must return to native dust?  O sight\r\n  Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold,\r\n  Horrid to think, how horrible to feel!\r\n\r\n    To whom thus MICHAEL.  Death thou hast seen\r\n  In his first shape on man; but many shapes\r\n  Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead\r\n  To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense\r\n  More terrible at th' entrance then within.\r\n  Some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die,\r\n  By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more\r\n  In Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring\r\n  Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew\r\n  Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know\r\n  What miserie th' inabstinence of EVE\r\n  Shall bring on men.  Immediately a place\r\n  Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark,\r\n  A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid\r\n  Numbers of all diseas'd, all maladies\r\n  Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes\r\n  Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds,\r\n  Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs,\r\n  Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs,\r\n  Dropsies, and Asthma's, and Joint-racking Rheums.\r\n  Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair\r\n  Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch;\r\n  And over them triumphant Death his Dart\r\n  Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok't\r\n  With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope.\r\n  Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long\r\n  Drie-ey'd behold?  ADAM could not, but wept,\r\n  Though not of Woman born; compassion quell'd\r\n  His best of Man, and gave him up to tears\r\n  A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess,\r\n  And scarce recovering words his plaint renew'd.\r\n\r\n    O miserable Mankind, to what fall\r\n  Degraded, to what wretched state reserv'd?\r\n  Better end heer unborn.  Why is life giv'n\r\n  To be thus wrested from us? rather why\r\n  Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew\r\n  What we receive, would either not accept\r\n  Life offer'd, or soon beg to lay it down,\r\n  Glad to be so dismist in peace.  Can thus\r\n  Th' Image of God in man created once\r\n  So goodly and erect, though faultie since,\r\n  To such unsightly sufferings be debas't\r\n  Under inhuman pains?  Why should not Man,\r\n  Retaining still Divine similitude\r\n  In part, from such deformities be free,\r\n  And for his Makers Image sake exempt?\r\n\r\n    Thir Makers Image, answerd MICHAEL, then\r\n  Forsook them, when themselves they villifi'd\r\n  To serve ungovern'd appetite, and took\r\n  His Image whom they serv'd, a brutish vice,\r\n  Inductive mainly to the sin of EVE.\r\n  Therefore so abject is thir punishment,\r\n  Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own,\r\n  Or if his likeness, by themselves defac't\r\n  While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules\r\n  To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they\r\n  Gods Image did not reverence in themselves.\r\n\r\n    I yeild it just, said ADAM, and submit.\r\n  But is there yet no other way, besides\r\n  These painful passages, how we may come\r\n  To Death, and mix with our connatural dust?\r\n\r\n    There is, said MICHAEL, if thou well observe\r\n  The rule of not too much, by temperance taught\r\n  In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence\r\n  Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight,\r\n  Till many years over thy head return:\r\n  So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop\r\n  Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease\r\n  Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature:\r\n  This is old age; but then thou must outlive\r\n  Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change\r\n  To witherd weak & gray; thy Senses then\r\n  Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe,\r\n  To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth\r\n  Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne\r\n  A melancholly damp of cold and dry\r\n  To waigh thy spirits down, and last consume\r\n  The Balme of Life.  To whom our Ancestor.\r\n\r\n    Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong\r\n  Life much, bent rather how I may be quit\r\n  Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge,\r\n  Which I must keep till my appointed day\r\n  Of rendring up.  MICHAEL to him repli'd.\r\n\r\n    Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst\r\n  Live well, how long or short permit to Heav'n:\r\n  And now prepare thee for another sight.\r\n\r\n    He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon\r\n  Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds\r\n  Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound\r\n  Of Instruments that made melodious chime\r\n  Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd\r\n  Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch\r\n  Instinct through all proportions low and high\r\n  Fled and pursu'd transverse the resonant fugue.\r\n  In other part stood one who at the Forge\r\n  Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass\r\n  Had melted (whether found where casual fire\r\n  Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale,\r\n  Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot\r\n  To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream\r\n  From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind\r\n  Into fit moulds prepar'd; from which he formd\r\n  First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought\r\n  Fulfil or grav'n in mettle.  After these,\r\n  But on the hether side a different sort\r\n  From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat,\r\n  Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise\r\n  Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent\r\n  To worship God aright, and know his works\r\n  Not hid, nor those things lost which might preserve\r\n  Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain\r\n  Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold\r\n  A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay\r\n  In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung\r\n  Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on:\r\n  The Men though grave, ey'd them, and let thir eyes\r\n  Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net\r\n  Fast caught, they lik'd, and each his liking chose;\r\n  And now of love they treat till th' Eevning Star\r\n  Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat\r\n  They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke\r\n  Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok't;\r\n  With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound.\r\n  Such happy interview and fair event\r\n  Of love & youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours,\r\n  And charming Symphonies attach'd the heart\r\n  Of ADAM, soon enclin'd to admit delight,\r\n  The bent of Nature; which he thus express'd.\r\n\r\n    True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest,\r\n  Much better seems this Vision, and more hope\r\n  Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past;\r\n  Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse,\r\n  Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends.\r\n\r\n    To whom thus MICHAEL.  Judg not what is best\r\n  By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet,\r\n  Created, as thou art, to nobler end\r\n  Holie and pure, conformitie divine.\r\n  Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents\r\n  Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race\r\n  Who slew his Brother; studious they appere\r\n  Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare,\r\n  Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit\r\n  Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd none.\r\n  Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget;\r\n  For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd\r\n  Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay,\r\n  Yet empty of all good wherein consists\r\n  Womans domestic honour and chief praise;\r\n  Bred onely and completed to the taste\r\n  Of lustful apperence, to sing, to dance,\r\n  To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye.\r\n  To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives\r\n  Religious titl'd them the Sons of God,\r\n  Shall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame\r\n  Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles\r\n  Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy,\r\n  (Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which\r\n  The world erelong a world of tears must weepe.\r\n\r\n    To whom thus ADAM of short joy bereft.\r\n  O pittie and shame, that they who to live well\r\n  Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread\r\n  Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint!\r\n  But still I see the tenor of Mans woe\r\n  Holds on the same, from Woman to begin.\r\n\r\n    From Mans effeminate slackness it begins,\r\n  Said th' Angel, who should better hold his place\r\n  By wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd.\r\n  But now prepare thee for another Scene.\r\n\r\n    He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred\r\n  Before him, Towns, and rural works between,\r\n  Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs,\r\n  Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr,\r\n  Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise;\r\n  Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed,\r\n  Single or in Array of Battel rang'd\r\n  Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood;\r\n  One way a Band select from forage drives\r\n  A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine\r\n  From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock,\r\n  Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine,\r\n  Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye,\r\n  But call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray;\r\n  With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine;\r\n  Where Cattel pastur'd late, now scatterd lies\r\n  With Carcasses and Arms th' ensanguind Field\r\n  Deserted: Others to a Citie strong\r\n  Lay Siege, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine,\r\n  Assaulting; others from the Wall defend\r\n  With Dart and Jav'lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire;\r\n  On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds.\r\n  In other part the scepter'd Haralds call\r\n  To Council in the Citie Gates: anon\r\n  Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt,\r\n  Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon\r\n  In factious opposition, till at last\r\n  Of middle Age one rising, eminent\r\n  In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong,\r\n  Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace,\r\n  And Judgement from above: him old and young\r\n  Exploded, and had seiz'd with violent hands,\r\n  Had not a Cloud descending snatch'd him thence\r\n  Unseen amid the throng: so violence\r\n  Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law\r\n  Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found.\r\n  ADAM was all in tears, and to his guide\r\n  Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these,\r\n  Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death\r\n  Inhumanly to men, and multiply\r\n  Ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew\r\n  His Brother; for of whom such massacher\r\n  Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men?\r\n  But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav'n\r\n  Rescu'd, had in his Righteousness bin lost?\r\n\r\n    To whom thus MICHAEL; These are the product\r\n  Of those ill-mated Marriages thou saw'st;\r\n  Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves\r\n  Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt,\r\n  Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind.\r\n  Such were these Giants, men of high renown;\r\n  For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir'd,\r\n  And Valour and Heroic Vertu call'd;\r\n  To overcome in Battel, and subdue\r\n  Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite\r\n  Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch\r\n  Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done\r\n  Of triumph, to be styl'd great Conquerours,\r\n  Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods,\r\n  Destroyers rightlier call'd and Plagues of men.\r\n  Thus Fame shall be achiev'd, renown on Earth,\r\n  And what most merits fame in silence hid.\r\n  But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst\r\n  The onely righteous in a World perverse,\r\n  And therefore hated, therefore so beset\r\n  With Foes for daring single to be just,\r\n  And utter odious Truth, that God would come\r\n  To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High\r\n  Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds\r\n  Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God\r\n  High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss,\r\n  Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward\r\n  Awaits the good, the rest what punishment;\r\n  Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold.\r\n\r\n    He look'd, & saw the face of things quite chang'd;\r\n  The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar,\r\n  All now was turn'd to jollitie and game,\r\n  To luxurie and riot, feast and dance,\r\n  Marrying or prostituting, as befell,\r\n  Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire\r\n  Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles.\r\n  At length a Reverend Sire among them came,\r\n  And of thir doings great dislike declar'd,\r\n  And testifi'd against thir wayes; hee oft\r\n  Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met,\r\n  Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd\r\n  Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls\r\n  In prison under Judgements imminent:\r\n  But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas'd\r\n  Contending, and remov'd his Tents farr off;\r\n  Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall,\r\n  Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk,\r\n  Measur'd by Cubit, length, & breadth, and highth,\r\n  Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore\r\n  Contriv'd, and of provisions laid in large\r\n  For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange!\r\n  Of everie Beast, and Bird, and Insect small\r\n  Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught\r\n  Thir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons\r\n  With thir four Wives, and God made fast the dore.\r\n  Meanwhile the Southwind rose, & with black wings\r\n  Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove\r\n  From under Heav'n; the Hills to their supplie\r\n  Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist,\r\n  Sent up amain; and now the thick'nd Skie\r\n  Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush'd the Rain\r\n  Impetuous, and continu'd till the Earth\r\n  No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum\r\n  Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow\r\n  Rode tilting o're the Waves, all dwellings else\r\n  Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp\r\n  Deep under water rould; Sea cover'd Sea,\r\n  Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces\r\n  Where luxurie late reign'd, Sea-monsters whelp'd\r\n  And stabl'd; of Mankind, so numerous late,\r\n  All left, in one small bottom swum imbark't.\r\n  How didst thou grieve then, ADAM, to behold\r\n  The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad,\r\n  Depopulation; thee another Floud,\r\n  Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown'd,\r\n  And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard\r\n  By th' Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last,\r\n  Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns\r\n  His Childern, all in view destroyd at once;\r\n  And scarce to th' Angel utterdst thus thy plaint.\r\n\r\n    O Visions ill foreseen! better had I\r\n  Liv'd ignorant of future, so had borne\r\n  My part of evil onely, each dayes lot\r\n  Anough to bear; those now, that were dispenst\r\n  The burd'n of many Ages, on me light\r\n  At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth\r\n  Abortive, to torment me ere thir being,\r\n  With thought that they must be.  Let no man seek\r\n  Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall\r\n  Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure,\r\n  Which neither his foreknowing can prevent,\r\n  And hee the future evil shall no less\r\n  In apprehension then in substance feel\r\n  Grievous to bear: but that care now is past,\r\n  Man is not whom to warne: those few escap't\r\n  Famin and anguish will at last consume\r\n  Wandring that watrie Desert: I had hope\r\n  When violence was ceas't, and Warr on Earth,\r\n  All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd\r\n  With length of happy days the race of man;\r\n  But I was farr deceav'd; for now I see\r\n  Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste.\r\n  How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide,\r\n  And whether here the Race of man will end.\r\n  To whom thus MICHAEL.  Those whom last thou sawst\r\n  In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they\r\n  First seen in acts of prowess eminent\r\n  And great exploits, but of true vertu void;\r\n  Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste\r\n  Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby\r\n  Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey,\r\n  Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth,\r\n  Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride\r\n  Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace.\r\n  The conquerd also, and enslav'd by Warr\r\n  Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose\r\n  And feare of God, from whom thir pietie feign'd\r\n  In sharp contest of Battel found no aide\r\n  Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale\r\n  Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure,\r\n  Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords\r\n  Shall leave them to enjoy; for th' Earth shall bear\r\n  More then anough, that temperance may be tri'd:\r\n  So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav'd,\r\n  Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot;\r\n  One Man except, the onely Son of light\r\n  In a dark Age, against example good,\r\n  Against allurement, custom, and a World\r\n  Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn,\r\n  Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes\r\n  Shall them admonish, and before them set\r\n  The paths of righteousness, how much more safe,\r\n  And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come\r\n  On thir impenitence; and shall returne\r\n  Of them derided, but of God observd\r\n  The one just Man alive; by his command\r\n  Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst,\r\n  To save himself and houshold from amidst\r\n  A World devote to universal rack.\r\n  No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast\r\n  Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg'd,\r\n  And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts\r\n  Of Heav'n set open on the Earth shall powre\r\n  Raine day and night, all fountaines of the Deep\r\n  Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp\r\n  Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise\r\n  Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount\r\n  Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd\r\n  Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud,\r\n  With all his verdure spoil'd, and Trees adrift\r\n  Down the great River to the op'ning Gulf,\r\n  And there take root an Iland salt and bare,\r\n  The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang.\r\n  To teach thee that God attributes to place\r\n  No sanctitie, if none be thither brought\r\n  By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell.\r\n  And now what further shall ensue, behold.\r\n\r\n    He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud,\r\n  Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled,\r\n  Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie\r\n  Wrinkl'd the face of Deluge, as decai'd;\r\n  And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass\r\n  Gaz'd hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew,\r\n  As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink\r\n  From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole\r\n  With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt\r\n  His Sluces, as the Heav'n his windows shut.\r\n  The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground\r\n  Fast on the top of som high mountain fixt.\r\n  And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer;\r\n  With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive\r\n  Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde.\r\n  Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies,\r\n  And after him, the surer messenger,\r\n  A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie\r\n  Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light;\r\n  The second time returning, in his Bill\r\n  An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe:\r\n  Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke\r\n  The ancient Sire descends with all his Train;\r\n  Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout,\r\n  Grateful to Heav'n, over his head beholds\r\n  A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow\r\n  Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay,\r\n  Betok'ning peace from God, and Cov'nant new.\r\n  Whereat the heart of ADAM erst so sad\r\n  Greatly rejoyc'd, and thus his joy broke forth.\r\n\r\n    O thou that future things canst represent\r\n  As present, Heav'nly instructer, I revive\r\n  At this last sight, assur'd that Man shall live\r\n  With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve.\r\n  Farr less I now lament for one whole World\r\n  Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce\r\n  For one Man found so perfet and so just,\r\n  That God voutsafes to raise another World\r\n  From him, and all his anger to forget.\r\n  But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn,\r\n  Distended as the Brow of God appeas'd,\r\n  Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde\r\n  The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud,\r\n  Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth?\r\n\r\n    To whom th' Archangel.  Dextrously thou aim'st;\r\n  So willingly doth God remit his Ire,\r\n  Though late repenting him of Man deprav'd,\r\n  Griev'd at his heart, when looking down he saw\r\n  The whole Earth fill'd with violence, and all flesh\r\n  Corrupting each thir way; yet those remoov'd,\r\n  Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight,\r\n  That he relents, not to blot out mankind,\r\n  And makes a Covenant never to destroy\r\n  The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea\r\n  Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World\r\n  With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings\r\n  Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set\r\n  His triple-colour'd Bow, whereon to look\r\n  And call to mind his Cov'nant: Day and Night,\r\n  Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost\r\n  Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new,\r\n  Both Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.\r\n  Thus thou hast seen one World begin and end;\r\n  And Man as from a second stock proceed.\r\n  Much thou hast yet to see, but I perceave\r\n  Thy mortal sight to faile; objects divine\r\n  Must needs impaire and wearie human sense:\r\n  Henceforth what is to com I will relate,\r\n  Thou therefore give due audience, and attend.\r\n  This second sours of Men, while yet but few,\r\n  And while the dread of judgement past remains\r\n  Fresh in thir mindes, fearing the Deitie,\r\n  With some regard to what is just and right\r\n  Shall lead thir lives, and multiplie apace,\r\n  Labouring the soile, and reaping plenteous crop,\r\n  Corn wine and oyle; and from the herd or flock,\r\n  Oft sacrificing Bullock, Lamb, or Kid,\r\n  With large Wine-offerings pour'd, and sacred Feast\r\n  Shal spend thir dayes in joy unblam'd, and dwell\r\n  Long time in peace by Families and Tribes\r\n  Under paternal rule; till one shall rise\r\n  Of proud ambitious heart, who not content\r\n  With fair equalitie, fraternal state,\r\n  Will arrogate Dominion undeserv'd\r\n  Over his brethren, and quite dispossess\r\n  Concord and law of Nature from the Earth;\r\n  Hunting (and Men not Beasts shall be his game)\r\n  With Warr and hostile snare such as refuse\r\n  Subjection to his Empire tyrannous:\r\n  A mightie Hunter thence he shall be styl'd\r\n  Before the Lord, as in despite of Heav'n,\r\n  Or from Heav'n claming second Sovrantie;\r\n  And from Rebellion shall derive his name,\r\n  Though of Rebellion others he accuse.\r\n  Hee with a crew, whom like Ambition joyns\r\n  With him or under him to tyrannize,\r\n  Marching from EDEN towards the West, shall finde\r\n  The Plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge\r\n  Boiles out from under ground, the mouth of Hell;\r\n  Of Brick, and of that stuff they cast to build\r\n  A Citie & Towre, whose top may reach to Heav'n;\r\n  And get themselves a name, least far disperst\r\n  In foraign Lands thir memorie be lost,\r\n  Regardless whether good or evil fame.\r\n  But God who oft descends to visit men\r\n  Unseen, and through thir habitations walks\r\n  To mark thir doings, them beholding soon,\r\n  Comes down to see thir Citie, ere the Tower\r\n  Obstruct Heav'n Towrs, and in derision sets\r\n  Upon thir Tongues a various Spirit to rase\r\n  Quite out thir Native Language, and instead\r\n  To sow a jangling noise of words unknown:\r\n  Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud\r\n  Among the Builders; each to other calls\r\n  Not understood, till hoarse, and all in rage,\r\n  As mockt they storm; great laughter was in Heav'n\r\n  And looking down, to see the hubbub strange\r\n  And hear the din; thus was the building left\r\n  Ridiculous, and the work Confusion nam'd.\r\n\r\n    Whereto thus ADAM fatherly displeas'd.\r\n  O execrable Son so to aspire\r\n  Above his Brethren, to himself affirming\r\n  Authoritie usurpt, from God not giv'n:\r\n  He gave us onely over Beast, Fish, Fowl\r\n  Dominion absolute; that right we hold\r\n  By his donation; but Man over men\r\n  He made not Lord; such title to himself\r\n  Reserving, human left from human free.\r\n  But this Usurper his encroachment proud\r\n  Stayes not on Man; to God his Tower intends\r\n  Siege and defiance: Wretched man! what food\r\n  Will he convey up thither to sustain\r\n  Himself and his rash Armie, where thin Aire\r\n  Above the Clouds will pine his entrails gross,\r\n  And famish him of Breath, if not of Bread?\r\n\r\n    To whom thus MICHAEL.  Justly thou abhorr'st\r\n  That Son, who on the quiet state of men\r\n  Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue\r\n  Rational Libertie; yet know withall,\r\n  Since thy original lapse, true Libertie\r\n  Is lost, which alwayes with right Reason dwells\r\n  Twinn'd, and from her hath no dividual being:\r\n  Reason in man obscur'd, or not obeyd,\r\n  Immediately inordinate desires\r\n  And upstart Passions catch the Government\r\n  From Reason, and to servitude reduce\r\n  Man till then free.  Therefore since hee permits\r\n  Within himself unworthie Powers to reign\r\n  Over free Reason, God in Judgement just\r\n  Subjects him from without to violent Lords;\r\n  Who oft as undeservedly enthrall\r\n  His outward freedom: Tyrannie must be,\r\n  Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse.\r\n  Yet somtimes Nations will decline so low\r\n  From vertue, which is reason, that no wrong,\r\n  But Justice, and some fatal curse annext\r\n  Deprives them of thir outward libertie,\r\n  Thir inward lost: Witness th' irreverent Son\r\n  Of him who built the Ark, who for the shame\r\n  Don to his Father, heard this heavie curse,\r\n  SERVANT OF SERVANTS, on his vitious Race.\r\n  Thus will this latter, as the former World,\r\n  Still tend from bad to worse, till God at last\r\n  Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw\r\n  His presence from among them, and avert\r\n  His holy Eyes; resolving from thenceforth\r\n  To leave them to thir own polluted wayes;\r\n  And one peculiar Nation to select\r\n  From all the rest, of whom to be invok'd,\r\n  A Nation from one faithful man to spring:\r\n  Him on this side EUPHRATES yet residing,\r\n  Bred up in Idol-worship; O that men\r\n  (Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown,\r\n  While yet the Patriark liv'd, who scap'd the Flood,\r\n  As to forsake the living God, and fall\r\n  To-worship thir own work in Wood and Stone\r\n  For Gods! yet him God the most High voutsafes\r\n  To call by Vision from his Fathers house,\r\n  His kindred and false Gods, into a Land\r\n  Which he will shew him, and from him will raise\r\n  A mightie Nation, and upon him showre\r\n  His benediction so, that in his Seed\r\n  All Nations shall be blest; hee straight obeys,\r\n  Not knowing to what Land, yet firm believes:\r\n  I see him, but thou canst not, with what Faith\r\n  He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soile\r\n  UR of CHALDAEA, passing now the Ford\r\n  To HARAN, after him a cumbrous Train\r\n  Of Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude;\r\n  Not wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth\r\n  With God, who call'd him, in a land unknown.\r\n  CANAAN he now attains, I see his Tents\r\n  Pitcht about SECHEM, and the neighbouring Plaine\r\n  Of MOREB; there by promise he receaves\r\n  Gift to his Progenie of all that Land;\r\n  From HAMATH Northward to the Desert South\r\n  (Things by thir names I call, though yet unnam'd)\r\n  From HERMON East to the great Western Sea,\r\n  Mount HERMON, yonder Sea, each place behold\r\n  In prospect, as I point them; on the shoare\r\n  Mount CARMEL; here the double-founted stream\r\n  JORDAN, true limit Eastward; but his Sons\r\n  Shall dwell to SENIR, that long ridge of Hills.\r\n  This ponder, that all Nations of the Earth\r\n  Shall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed\r\n  Is meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise\r\n  The Serpents head; whereof to thee anon\r\n  Plainlier shall be reveald.  This Patriarch blest,\r\n  Whom FAITHFUL ABRAHAM due time shall call,\r\n  A Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves,\r\n  Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown;\r\n  The Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast, departs\r\n  From CANAAN, to a Land hereafter call'd\r\n  EGYPT, divided by the River NILE;\r\n  See where it flows, disgorging at seaven mouthes\r\n  Into the Sea: to sojourn in that Land\r\n  He comes invited by a yonger Son\r\n  In time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds\r\n  Raise him to be the second in that Realme\r\n  Of PHARAO: there he dies, and leaves his Race\r\n  Growing into a Nation, and now grown\r\n  Suspected to a sequent King, who seeks\r\n  To stop thir overgrowth, as inmate guests\r\n  Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves\r\n  Inhospitably, and kills thir infant Males:\r\n  Till by two brethren (those two brethren call\r\n  MOSES and AARON) sent from God to claime\r\n  His people from enthralment, they return\r\n  With glory and spoile back to thir promis'd Land.\r\n  But first the lawless Tyrant, who denies\r\n  To know thir God, or message to regard,\r\n  Must be compelld by Signes and Judgements dire;\r\n  To blood unshed the Rivers must be turnd,\r\n  Frogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill\r\n  With loath'd intrusion, and fill all the land;\r\n  His Cattel must of Rot and Murren die,\r\n  Botches and blaines must all his flesh imboss,\r\n  And all his people; Thunder mixt with Haile,\r\n  Haile mixt with fire must rend th' EGYPTIAN Skie\r\n  And wheel on th' Earth, devouring where it rouls;\r\n  What it devours not, Herb, or Fruit, or Graine,\r\n  A darksom Cloud of Locusts swarming down\r\n  Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green:\r\n  Darkness must overshadow all his bounds,\r\n  Palpable darkness, and blot out three dayes;\r\n  Last with one midnight stroke all the first-born\r\n  Of EGYPT must lie dead.  Thus with ten wounds\r\n  This River-dragon tam'd at length submits\r\n  To let his sojourners depart, and oft\r\n  Humbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice\r\n  More hard'nd after thaw, till in his rage\r\n  Pursuing whom he late dismissd, the Sea\r\n  Swallows him with his Host, but them lets pass\r\n  As on drie land between two christal walls,\r\n  Aw'd by the rod of MOSES so to stand\r\n  Divided, till his rescu'd gain thir shoar:\r\n  Such wondrous power God to his Saint will lend,\r\n  Though present in his Angel, who shall goe\r\n  Before them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire,\r\n  To guide them in thir journey, and remove\r\n  Behinde them, while th' obdurat King pursues:\r\n  All night he will pursue, but his approach\r\n  Darkness defends between till morning Watch;\r\n  Then through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud\r\n  God looking forth will trouble all his Host\r\n  And craze thir Chariot wheels: when by command\r\n  MOSES once more his potent Rod extends\r\n  Over the Sea; the Sea his Rod obeys;\r\n  On thir imbattelld ranks the Waves return,\r\n  And overwhelm thir Warr: the Race elect\r\n  Safe towards CANAAN from the shoar advance\r\n  Through the wilde Desert, not the readiest way,\r\n  Least entring on the CANAANITE allarmd\r\n  Warr terrifie them inexpert, and feare\r\n  Return them back to EGYPT, choosing rather\r\n  Inglorious life with servitude; for life\r\n  To noble and ignoble is more sweet\r\n  Untraind in Armes, where rashness leads not on.\r\n  This also shall they gain by thir delay\r\n  In the wide Wilderness, there they shall found\r\n  Thir government, and thir great Senate choose\r\n  Through the twelve Tribes, to rule by Laws ordaind:\r\n  God from the Mount of SINAI, whose gray top\r\n  Shall tremble, he descending, will himself\r\n  In Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound\r\n  Ordaine them Lawes; part such as appertaine\r\n  To civil Justice, part religious Rites\r\n  Of sacrifice, informing them, by types\r\n  And shadowes, of that destind Seed to bruise\r\n  The Serpent, by what meanes he shall achieve\r\n  Mankinds deliverance.  But the voice of God\r\n  To mortal eare is dreadful; they beseech\r\n  That MOSES might report to them his will,\r\n  And terror cease; he grants them thir desire,\r\n  Instructed that to God is no access\r\n  Without Mediator, whose high Office now\r\n  MOSES in figure beares, to introduce\r\n  One greater, of whose day he shall foretell,\r\n  And all the Prophets in thir Age the times\r\n  Of great MESSIAH shall sing.  Thus Laws and Rites\r\n  Establisht, such delight hath God in Men\r\n  Obedient to his will, that he voutsafes\r\n  Among them to set up his Tabernacle,\r\n  The holy One with mortal Men to dwell:\r\n  By his prescript a Sanctuary is fram'd\r\n  Of Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein\r\n  An Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony,\r\n  The Records of his Cov'nant, over these\r\n  A Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings\r\n  Of two bright Cherubim, before him burn\r\n  Seaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing\r\n  The Heav'nly fires; over the Tent a Cloud\r\n  Shall rest by Day, a fierie gleame by Night,\r\n  Save when they journie, and at length they come,\r\n  Conducted by his Angel to the Land\r\n  Promisd to ABRAHAM and his Seed: the rest\r\n  Were long to tell, how many Battels fought,\r\n  How many Kings destroyd, and Kingdoms won,\r\n  Or how the Sun shall in mid Heav'n stand still\r\n  A day entire, and Nights due course adjourne,\r\n  Mans voice commanding, Sun in GIBEON stand,\r\n  And thou Moon in the vale of AIALON,\r\n  Till ISRAEL overcome; so call the third\r\n  From ABRAHAM, Son of ISAAC, and from him\r\n  His whole descent, who thus shall CANAAN win.\r\n\r\n    Here ADAM interpos'd.  O sent from Heav'n,\r\n  Enlightner of my darkness, gracious things\r\n  Thou hast reveald, those chiefly which concerne\r\n  Just ABRAHAM and his Seed: now first I finde\r\n  Mine eyes true op'ning, and my heart much eas'd,\r\n  Erwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom\r\n  Of mee and all Mankind; but now I see\r\n  His day, in whom all Nations shall be blest,\r\n  Favour unmerited by me, who sought\r\n  Forbidd'n knowledge by forbidd'n means.\r\n  This yet I apprehend not, why to those\r\n  Among whom God will deigne to dwell on Earth\r\n  So many and so various Laws are giv'n;\r\n  So many Laws argue so many sins\r\n  Among them; how can God with such reside?\r\n\r\n    To whom thus MICHAEL.  Doubt not but that sin\r\n  Will reign among them, as of thee begot;\r\n  And therefore was Law given them to evince\r\n  Thir natural pravitie, by stirring up\r\n  Sin against Law to fight; that when they see\r\n  Law can discover sin, but not remove,\r\n  Save by those shadowie expiations weak,\r\n  The bloud of Bulls and Goats, they may conclude\r\n  Some bloud more precious must be paid for Man,\r\n  Just for unjust, that in such righteousness\r\n  To them by Faith imputed, they may finde\r\n  Justification towards God, and peace\r\n  Of Conscience, which the Law by Ceremonies\r\n  Cannot appease, nor Man the moral part\r\n  Perform, and not performing cannot live.\r\n  So Law appears imperfet, and but giv'n\r\n  With purpose to resign them in full time\r\n  Up to a better Cov'nant, disciplin'd\r\n  From shadowie Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit,\r\n  From imposition of strict Laws, to free\r\n  Acceptance of large Grace, from servil fear\r\n  To filial, works of Law to works of Faith.\r\n  And therefore shall not MOSES, though of God\r\n  Highly belov'd, being but the Minister\r\n  Of Law, his people into CANAAN lead;\r\n  But JOSHUA whom the Gentiles JESUS call,\r\n  His Name and Office bearing, who shall quell\r\n  The adversarie Serpent, and bring back\r\n  Through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man\r\n  Safe to eternal Paradise of rest.\r\n  Meanwhile they in thir earthly CANAAN plac't\r\n  Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins\r\n  National interrupt thir public peace,\r\n  Provoking God to raise them enemies:\r\n  From whom as oft he saves them penitent\r\n  By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom\r\n  The second, both for pietie renownd\r\n  And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive\r\n  Irrevocable, that his Regal Throne\r\n  For ever shall endure; the like shall sing\r\n  All Prophecie, That of the Royal Stock\r\n  Of DAVID (so I name this King) shall rise\r\n  A Son, the Womans Seed to thee foretold,\r\n  Foretold to ABRAHAM, as in whom shall trust\r\n  All Nations, and to Kings foretold, of Kings\r\n  The last, for of his Reign shall be no end.\r\n  But first a long succession must ensue,\r\n  And his next Son for Wealth and Wisdom fam'd,\r\n  The clouded Ark of God till then in Tents\r\n  Wandring, shall in a glorious Temple enshrine.\r\n  Such follow him, as shall be registerd\r\n  Part good, part bad, of bad the longer scrowle,\r\n  Whose foul Idolatries, and other faults\r\n  Heapt to the popular summe, will so incense\r\n  God, as to leave them, and expose thir Land,\r\n  Thir Citie, his Temple, and his holy Ark\r\n  With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey\r\n  To that proud Citie, whose high Walls thou saw'st\r\n  Left in confusion, BABYLON thence call'd.\r\n  There in captivitie he lets them dwell\r\n  The space of seventie years, then brings them back,\r\n  Remembring mercie, and his Cov'nant sworn\r\n  To DAVID, stablisht as the dayes of Heav'n.\r\n  Returnd from BABYLON by leave of Kings\r\n  Thir Lords, whom God dispos'd, the house of God\r\n  They first re-edifie, and for a while\r\n  In mean estate live moderate, till grown\r\n  In wealth and multitude, factious they grow;\r\n  But first among the Priests dissension springs,\r\n  Men who attend the Altar, and should most\r\n  Endeavour Peace: thir strife pollution brings\r\n  Upon the Temple it self: at last they seise\r\n  The Scepter, and regard not DAVIDS Sons,\r\n  Then loose it to a stranger, that the true\r\n  Anointed King MESSIAH might be born\r\n  Barr'd of his right; yet at his Birth a Starr\r\n  Unseen before in Heav'n proclaims him com,\r\n  And guides the Eastern Sages, who enquire\r\n  His place, to offer Incense, Myrrh, and Gold;\r\n  His place of birth a solemn Angel tells\r\n  To simple Shepherds, keeping watch by night;\r\n  They gladly thither haste, and by a Quire\r\n  Of squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung.\r\n  A Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire\r\n  The Power of the most High; he shall ascend\r\n  The Throne hereditarie, and bound his Reign\r\n  With earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heav'ns.\r\n\r\n    He ceas'd, discerning ADAM with such joy\r\n  Surcharg'd, as had like grief bin dew'd in tears,\r\n  Without the vent of words, which these he breathd.\r\n\r\n    O Prophet of glad tidings, finisher\r\n  Of utmost hope! now clear I understand\r\n  What oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain,\r\n  Why our great expectation should be call'd\r\n  The seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, Haile,\r\n  High in the love of Heav'n, yet from my Loynes\r\n  Thou shalt proceed, and from thy Womb the Son\r\n  Of God most High; So God with man unites.\r\n  Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise\r\n  Expect with mortal paine: say where and when\r\n  Thir fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel.\r\n\r\n    To whom thus MICHAEL.  Dream not of thir fight,\r\n  As of a Duel, or the local wounds\r\n  Of head or heel: not therefore joynes the Son\r\n  Manhood to God-head, with more strength to foil\r\n  Thy enemie; nor so is overcome\r\n  SATAN, whose fall from Heav'n, a deadlier bruise,\r\n  Disabl'd not to give thee thy deaths wound:\r\n  Which hee, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure,\r\n  Not by destroying SATAN, but his works\r\n  In thee and in thy Seed: nor can this be,\r\n  But by fulfilling that which thou didst want,\r\n  Obedience to the Law of God, impos'd\r\n  On penaltie of death, and suffering death,\r\n  The penaltie to thy transgression due,\r\n  And due to theirs which out of thine will grow:\r\n  So onely can high Justice rest appaid.\r\n  The Law of God exact he shall fulfill\r\n  Both by obedience and by love, though love\r\n  Alone fulfill the Law; thy punishment\r\n  He shall endure by coming in the Flesh\r\n  To a reproachful life and cursed death,\r\n  Proclaiming Life to all who shall believe\r\n  In his redemption, and that his obedience\r\n  Imputed becomes theirs by Faith, his merits\r\n  To save them, not thir own, though legal works.\r\n  For this he shall live hated, be blasphem'd,\r\n  Seis'd on by force, judg'd, and to death condemnd\r\n  A shameful and accurst, naild to the Cross\r\n  By his own Nation, slaine for bringing Life;\r\n  But to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies,\r\n  The Law that is against thee, and the sins\r\n  Of all mankinde, with him there crucifi'd,\r\n  Never to hurt them more who rightly trust\r\n  In this his satisfaction; so he dies,\r\n  But soon revives, Death over him no power\r\n  Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light\r\n  Returne, the Starres of Morn shall see him rise\r\n  Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light,\r\n  Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems,\r\n  His death for Man, as many as offerd Life\r\n  Neglect not, and the benefit imbrace\r\n  By Faith not void of works: this God-like act\r\n  Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have dy'd,\r\n  In sin for ever lost from life; this act\r\n  Shall bruise the head of SATAN, crush his strength\r\n  Defeating Sin and Death, his two maine armes,\r\n  And fix farr deeper in his head thir stings\r\n  Then temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel,\r\n  Or theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep,\r\n  A gentle wafting to immortal Life.\r\n  Nor after resurrection shall he stay\r\n  Longer on Earth then certaine times to appeer\r\n  To his Disciples, Men who in his Life\r\n  Still follow'd him; to them shall leave in charge\r\n  To teach all nations what of him they learn'd\r\n  And his Salvation, them who shall beleeve\r\n  Baptizing in the profluent streame, the signe\r\n  Of washing them from guilt of sin to Life\r\n  Pure, and in mind prepar'd, if so befall,\r\n  For death, like that which the redeemer dy'd.\r\n  All Nations they shall teach; for from that day\r\n  Not onely to the Sons of ABRAHAMS Loines\r\n  Salvation shall be Preacht, but to the Sons\r\n  Of ABRAHAMS Faith wherever through the world;\r\n  So in his seed all Nations shall be blest.\r\n  Then to the Heav'n of Heav'ns he shall ascend\r\n  With victory, triumphing through the aire\r\n  Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise\r\n  The Serpent, Prince of aire, and drag in Chaines\r\n  Through all his realme, & there confounded leave;\r\n  Then enter into glory, and resume\r\n  His Seat at Gods right hand, exalted high\r\n  Above all names in Heav'n; and thence shall come,\r\n  When this worlds dissolution shall be ripe,\r\n  With glory and power to judge both quick & dead,\r\n  To judge th' unfaithful dead, but to reward\r\n  His faithful, and receave them into bliss,\r\n  Whether in Heav'n or Earth, for then the Earth\r\n  Shall all be Paradise, far happier place\r\n  Then this of EDEN, and far happier daies.\r\n\r\n    So spake th' Archangel MICHAEL, then paus'd,\r\n  As at the Worlds great period; and our Sire\r\n  Replete with joy and wonder thus repli'd.\r\n\r\n    O goodness infinite, goodness immense!\r\n  That all this good of evil shall produce,\r\n  And evil turn to good; more wonderful\r\n  Then that which by creation first brought forth\r\n  Light out of darkness! full of doubt I stand,\r\n  Whether I should repent me now of sin\r\n  By mee done and occasiond, or rejoyce\r\n  Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring,\r\n  To God more glory, more good will to Men\r\n  From God, and over wrauth grace shall abound.\r\n  But say, if our deliverer up to Heav'n\r\n  Must reascend, what will betide the few\r\n  His faithful, left among th' unfaithful herd,\r\n  The enemies of truth; who then shall guide\r\n  His people, who defend? will they not deale\r\n  Wors with his followers then with him they dealt?\r\n\r\n    Be sure they will, said th' Angel; but from Heav'n\r\n  Hee to his own a Comforter will send,\r\n  The promise of the Father, who shall dwell\r\n  His Spirit within them, and the Law of Faith\r\n  Working through love, upon thir hearts shall write,\r\n  To guide them in all truth, and also arme\r\n  With spiritual Armour, able to resist\r\n  SATANS assaults, and quench his fierie darts\r\n  What Man can do against them, not affraid,\r\n  Though to the death, against such cruelties\r\n  With inward consolations recompenc't,\r\n  And oft supported so as shall amaze\r\n  Thir proudest persecuters: for the Spirit\r\n  Powrd first on his Apostles, whom he sends\r\n  To evangelize the Nations, then on all\r\n  Baptiz'd, shall them with wondrous gifts endue\r\n  To speak all Tongues, and do all Miracles,\r\n  As did thir Lord before them.  Thus they win\r\n  Great numbers of each Nation to receave\r\n  With joy the tidings brought from Heav'n: at length\r\n  Thir Ministry perform'd, and race well run,\r\n  Thir doctrine and thir story written left,\r\n  They die; but in thir room, as they forewarne,\r\n  Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves,\r\n  Who all the sacred mysteries of Heav'n\r\n  To thir own vile advantages shall turne\r\n  Of lucre and ambition, and the truth\r\n  With superstitions and traditions taint,\r\n  Left onely in those written Records pure,\r\n  Though not but by the Spirit understood.\r\n  Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names,\r\n  Places and titles, and with these to joine\r\n  Secular power, though feigning still to act\r\n  By spiritual, to themselves appropriating\r\n  The Spirit of God, promisd alike and giv'n\r\n  To all Beleevers; and from that pretense,\r\n  Spiritual Lawes by carnal power shall force\r\n  On every conscience; Laws which none shall finde\r\n  Left them inrould, or what the Spirit within\r\n  Shall on the heart engrave.  What will they then\r\n  But force the Spirit of Grace it self, and binde\r\n  His consort Libertie; what, but unbuild\r\n  His living Temples, built by Faith to stand,\r\n  Thir own Faith not anothers: for on Earth\r\n  Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard\r\n  Infallible? yet many will presume:\r\n  Whence heavie persecution shall arise\r\n  On all who in the worship persevere\r\n  Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, farr greater part,\r\n  Will deem in outward Rites and specious formes\r\n  Religion satisfi'd; Truth shall retire\r\n  Bestuck with slandrous darts, and works of Faith\r\n  Rarely be found: so shall the World goe on,\r\n  To good malignant, to bad men benigne,\r\n  Under her own waight groaning, till the day\r\n  Appeer of respiration to the just,\r\n  And vengeance to the wicked, at return\r\n  Of him so lately promis'd to thy aid,\r\n  The Womans seed, obscurely then foretold,\r\n  Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord,\r\n  Last in the Clouds from Heav'n to be reveald\r\n  In glory of the Father, to dissolve\r\n  SATAN with his perverted World, then raise\r\n  From the conflagrant mass, purg'd and refin'd,\r\n  New Heav'ns, new Earth, Ages of endless date\r\n  Founded in righteousness and peace and love,\r\n  To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss.\r\n\r\n    He ended; and thus ADAM last reply'd.\r\n  How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest,\r\n  Measur'd this transient World, the Race of time,\r\n  Till time stand fixt: beyond is all abyss,\r\n  Eternitie, whose end no eye can reach.\r\n  Greatly instructed I shall hence depart,\r\n  Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill\r\n  Of knowledge, what this vessel can containe;\r\n  Beyond which was my folly to aspire.\r\n  Henceforth I learne, that to obey is best,\r\n  And love with feare the onely God, to walk\r\n  As in his presence, ever to observe\r\n  His providence, and on him sole depend,\r\n  Merciful over all his works, with good\r\n  Still overcoming evil, and by small\r\n  Accomplishing great things, by things deemd weak\r\n  Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise\r\n  By simply meek; that suffering for Truths sake\r\n  Is fortitude to highest victorie,\r\n  And to the faithful Death the Gate of Life;\r\n  Taught this by his example whom I now\r\n  Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.\r\n\r\n    To whom thus also th' Angel last repli'd:\r\n  This having learnt, thou hast attaind the summe\r\n  Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the Starrs\r\n  Thou knewst by name, and all th' ethereal Powers,\r\n  All secrets of the deep, all Natures works,\r\n  Or works of God in Heav'n, Air, Earth, or Sea,\r\n  And all the riches of this World enjoydst,\r\n  And all the rule, one Empire; onely add\r\n  Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith,\r\n  Add Vertue, Patience, Temperance, add Love,\r\n  By name to come call'd Charitie, the soul\r\n  Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath\r\n  To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess\r\n  A Paradise within thee, happier farr.\r\n  Let us descend now therefore from this top\r\n  Of Speculation; for the hour precise\r\n  Exacts our parting hence; and see the Guards,\r\n  By mee encampt on yonder Hill, expect\r\n  Thir motion, at whose Front a flaming Sword,\r\n  In signal of remove, waves fiercely round;\r\n  We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve;\r\n  Her also I with gentle Dreams have calm'd\r\n  Portending good, and all her spirits compos'd\r\n  To meek submission: thou at season fit\r\n  Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard,\r\n  Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know,\r\n  The great deliverance by her Seed to come\r\n  (For by the Womans Seed) on all Mankind.\r\n  That ye may live, which will be many dayes,\r\n  Both in one Faith unanimous though sad,\r\n  With cause for evils past, yet much more cheer'd\r\n  With meditation on the happie end.\r\n\r\n    He ended, and they both descend the Hill;\r\n  Descended, ADAM to the Bowre where EVE\r\n  Lay sleeping ran before, but found her wak't;\r\n  And thus with words not sad she him receav'd.\r\n\r\n    Whence thou returnst, & whither wentst, I know;\r\n  For God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise,\r\n  Which he hath sent propitious, some great good\r\n  Presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress\r\n  VVearied I fell asleep: but now lead on;\r\n  In mee is no delay; with thee to goe,\r\n  Is to stay here; without thee here to stay,\r\n  Is to go hence unwilling; thou to mee\r\n  Art all things under Heav'n, all places thou,\r\n  VVho for my wilful crime art banisht hence.\r\n  This further consolation yet secure\r\n  I carry hence; though all by mee is lost,\r\n  Such favour I unworthie am voutsaft,\r\n  By mee the Promis'd Seed shall all restore.\r\n\r\n    So spake our Mother EVE, and ADAM heard\r\n  VVell pleas'd, but answer'd not; for now too nigh\r\n  Th' Archangel stood, and from the other Hill\r\n  To thir fixt Station, all in bright array\r\n  The Cherubim descended; on the ground\r\n  Gliding meteorous, as Ev'ning Mist\r\n  Ris'n from a River o're the marish glides,\r\n  And gathers ground fast at the Labourers heel\r\n  Homeward returning.  High in Front advanc't,\r\n  The brandisht Sword of God before them blaz'd\r\n  Fierce as a Comet; which with torrid heat,\r\n  And vapour as the LIBYAN Air adust,\r\n  Began to parch that temperate Clime; whereat\r\n  In either hand the hastning Angel caught\r\n  Our lingring Parents, and to th' Eastern Gate\r\n  Let them direct, and down the Cliff as fast\r\n  To the subjected Plaine; then disappeer'd.\r\n  They looking back, all th' Eastern side beheld\r\n  Of Paradise, so late thir happie seat,\r\n  Wav'd over by that flaming Brand, the Gate\r\n  With dreadful Faces throng'd and fierie Armes:\r\n  Som natural tears they drop'd, but wip'd them soon;\r\n  The World was all before them, where to choose\r\n  Thir place of rest, and Providence thir guide:\r\n  They hand in hand with wandring steps and slow,\r\n  Through EDEN took thir solitarie way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}ded, it will be necessary to a just estimate of\r\nits force, first, to ascertain the real character of the government\r\nin question; secondly, to inquire how far the convention were\r\nauthorized to propose such a government; and thirdly, how far the\r\nduty they owed to their country could supply any defect of regular\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nFirst. In order to ascertain the real character of the\r\ngovernment, it may be considered in relation to the foundation on\r\nwhich it is to be established; to the sources from which its\r\nordinary powers are to be drawn; to the operation of those powers;\r\nto the extent of them; and to the authority by which future\r\nchanges in the government are to be introduced.\r\n\r\nOn examining the first relation, it appears, on one hand, that\r\nthe Constitution is to be founded on the assent and ratification of\r\nthe people of America, given by deputies elected for the special\r\npurpose; but, on the other, that this assent and ratification is to\r\nbe given by the people, not as individuals composing one entire\r\nnation, but as composing the distinct and independent States to\r\nwhich they respectively belong. It is to be the assent and\r\nratification of the several States, derived from the supreme\r\nauthority in each State, the authority of the people themselves.\r\nThe act, therefore, establishing the Constitution, will not be a\r\nNATIONAL, but a FEDERAL act.\r\n\r\nThat it will be a federal and not a national act, as these terms\r\nare understood by the objectors; the act of the people, as forming\r\nso many independent States, not as forming one aggregate nation, is\r\nobvious from this single consideration, that it is to result neither\r\nfrom the decision of a MAJORITY of the people of the Union, nor from\r\nthat of a MAJORITY of the States. It must result from the UNANIMOUS\r\nassent of the several States that are parties to it, differing no\r\notherwise from their ordinary assent than in its being expressed,\r\nnot by the legislative authority, but by that of the people\r\nthemselves. Were the people regarded in this transaction as forming\r\none nation, the will of the majority of the whole people of the\r\nUnited States would bind the minority, in the same manner as the\r\nmajority in each State must bind the minority; and the will of the\r\nmajority must be determined either by a comparison of the individual\r\nvotes, or by considering the will of the majority of the States as\r\nevidence of the will of a majority of the people of the United\r\nStates. Neither of these rules have been adopted. Each State, in\r\nratifying the Constitution, is considered as a sovereign body,\r\nindependent of all others, and only to be bound by its own voluntary\r\nact. In this relation, then, the new Constitution will, if\r\nestablished, be a FEDERAL, and not a NATIONAL constitution.\r\n\r\nThe next relation is, to the sources from which the ordinary\r\npowers of government are to be derived. The House of\r\nRepresentatives will derive its powers from the people of America;\r\nand the people will be represented in the same proportion, and on\r\nthe same principle, as they are in the legislature of a particular\r\nState. So far the government is NATIONAL, not FEDERAL. The Senate,\r\non the other hand, will derive its powers from the States, as\r\npolitical and coequal societies; and these will be represented on\r\nthe principle of equality in the Senate, as they now are in the\r\nexisting Congress. So far the government is FEDERAL, not NATIONAL.\r\nThe executive power will be derived from a very compound source.\r\nThe immediate election of the President is to be made by the States\r\nin their political characters. The votes allotted to them are in a\r\ncompound ratio, which considers them partly as distinct and coequal\r\nsocieties, partly as unequal members of the same society. The\r\neventual election, again, is to be made by that branch of the\r\nlegislature which consists of the national representatives; but in\r\nthis particular act they are to be thrown into the form of\r\nindividual delegations, from so many distinct and coequal bodies\r\npolitic. From this aspect of the government it appears to be of a\r\nmixed character, presenting at least as many FEDERAL as NATIONAL\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nThe difference between a federal and national government, as it\r\nrelates to the OPERATION OF THE GOVERNMENT, is supposed to consist\r\nin this, that in the former the powers operate on the political\r\nbodies composing the Confederacy, in their political capacities; in\r\nthe latter, on the individual citizens composing the nation, in\r\ntheir individual capacities. On trying the Constitution by this\r\ncriterion, it falls under the NATIONAL, not the FEDERAL character;\r\nthough perhaps not so completely as has been understood. In\r\nseveral cases, and particularly in the trial of controversies to\r\nwhich States may be parties, they must be viewed and proceeded\r\nagainst in their collective and political capacities only. So far\r\nthe national countenance of the government on this side seems to be\r\ndisfigured by a few federal features. But this blemish is perhaps\r\nunavoidable in any plan; and the operation of the government on the\r\npeople, in their individual capacities, in its ordinary and most\r\nessential proceedings, may, on the whole, designate it, in this\r\nrelation, a NATIONAL government.\r\n\r\nBut if the government be national with regard to the OPERATION\r\nof its powers, it changes its aspect again when we contemplate it in\r\nrelation to the EXTENT of its powers. The idea of a national\r\ngovernment involves in it, not only an authority over the individual\r\ncitizens, but an indefinite supremacy over all persons and things,\r\nso far as they are objects of lawful government. Among a people\r\nconsolidated into one nation, this supremacy is completely vested in\r\nthe national legislature. Among communities united for particular\r\npurposes, it is vested partly in the general and partly in the\r\nmunicipal legislatures. In the former case, all local authorities\r\nare subordinate to the supreme; and may be controlled, directed, or\r\nabolished by it at pleasure. In the latter, the local or municipal\r\nauthorities form distinct and independent portions of the supremacy,\r\nno more subject, within their respective spheres, to the general\r\nauthority, than the general authority is subject to them, within its\r\nown sphere. In this relation, then, the proposed government cannot\r\nbe deemed a NATIONAL one; since its jurisdiction extends to certain\r\nenumerated objects only, and leaves to the several States a\r\nresiduary and inviolable sovereignty over all other objects. It is\r\ntrue that in controversies relating to the boundary between the two\r\njurisdictions, the tribunal which is ultimately to decide, is to be\r\nestablished under the general government. But this does not change\r\nthe principle of the case. The decision is to be impartially made,\r\naccording to the rules of the Constitution; and all the usual and\r\nmost effectual precautions are taken to secure this impartiality.\r\nSome such tribunal is clearly essential to prevent an appeal to the\r\nsword and a dissolution of the compact; and that it ought to be\r\nestablished under the general rather than under the local\r\ngovernments, or, to speak more properly, that it could be safely\r\nestablished under the first alone, is a position not likely to be\r\ncombated.\r\n\r\nIf we try the Constitution by its last relation to the authority\r\nby which amendments are to be made, we find it neither wholly\r\nNATIONAL nor wholly FEDERAL. Were it wholly national, the supreme\r\nand ultimate authority would reside in the MAJORITY of the people of\r\nthe Union; and this authority would be competent at all times, like\r\nthat of a majority of every national society, to alter or abolish\r\nits established government. Were it wholly federal, on the other\r\nhand, the concurrence of each State in the Union would be essential\r\nto every alteration that would be binding on all. The mode provided\r\nby the plan of the convention is not founded on either of these\r\nprinciples. In requiring more than a majority, and principles. In\r\nrequiring more than a majority, and particularly in computing the\r\nproportion by STATES, not by CITIZENS, it departs from the NATIONAL\r\nand advances towards the FEDERAL character; in rendering the\r\nconcurrence of less than the whole number of States sufficient, it\r\nloses again the FEDERAL and partakes of the NATIONAL character.\r\n\r\nThe proposed Constitution, therefore, is, in strictness, neither\r\na national nor a federal Constitution, but a composition of both.\r\nIn its foundation it is federal, not national; in the sources from\r\nwhich the ordinary powers of the government are drawn, it is partly\r\nfederal and partly national; in the operation of these powers, it\r\nis national, not federal; in the extent of them, again, it is\r\nfederal, not national; and, finally, in the authoritative mode of\r\nintroducing amendments, it is neither wholly federal nor wholly\r\nnational.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 40\r\n\r\nThe Powers of the Convention to Form a Mixed Government Examined\r\n\r\nand Sustained\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nFriday, January 18, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADISON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND point to be examined is, whether the convention were\r\n\r\nauthorized to frame and propose this mixed Constitution. The\r\n\r\npowers of the convention ought, in strictness, to be determined\r\n\r\nby an inspection of the commissions given to the members by their\r\n\r\nrespective constituents. As all of these, however, had reference,\r\n\r\neither to the recommendation from the meeting at Annapolis, in\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1786, or to that from Congress, in February, 1787, it\r\n\r\nwill be sufficient to recur to these particular acts. The act\r\n\r\nfrom Annapolis recommends the \"appointment of commissioners to\r\n\r\ntake into consideration the situation of the United States; to\r\n\r\ndevise SUCH FURTHER PROVISIONS as shall appear to them necessary\r\n\r\nto render the Constitution of the federal government ADEQUATE TO\r\n\r\nTHE EXIGENCIES OF THE UNION; and to report such an act for that\r\n\r\npurpose, to the United States in Congress assembled, as when\r\n\r\nagreed to by them, and afterwards confirmed by the legislature of\r\n\r\nevery State, will effectually provide for the same. \"The\r\n\r\nrecommendatory act of Congress is in the words\r\n\r\nfollowing:\"WHEREAS, There is provision in the articles of\r\n\r\nConfederation and perpetual Union, for making alterations\r\n\r\ntherein, by the assent of a Congress of the United States, and of\r\n\r\nthe legislatures of the several States; and whereas experience\r\n\r\nhath evinced, that there are defects in the present\r\n\r\nConfederation; as a mean to remedy which, several of the States,\r\n\r\nand PARTICULARLY THE STATE OF NEW YORK, by express instructions\r\n\r\nto their delegates in Congress, have suggested a convention for\r\n\r\nthe purposes expressed in the following resolution; and such\r\n\r\nconvention appearing to be the most probable mean of establishing\r\n\r\nin these States A FIRM NATIONAL GOVERNMENT:\"Resolved, That in\r\n\r\nthe opinion of Congress it is expedient, that on the second\r\n\r\nMonday of May next a convention of delegates, who shall have been\r\n\r\nappointed by the several States, be held at Philadelphia, for the\r\n\r\nsole and express purpose OF REVISING THE ARTICLES OF\r\n\r\nCONFEDERATION, and reporting to Congress and the several\r\n\r\nlegislatures such ALTERATIONS AND PROVISIONS THEREIN, as shall,\r\n\r\nwhen agreed to in Congress, and confirmed by the States, render\r\n\r\nthe federal Constitution ADEQUATE TO THE EXIGENCIES OF GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nAND THE PRESERVATION OF THE UNION. \"From these two acts, it\r\n\r\nappears, 1st, that the object of the convention was to establish,\r\n\r\nin these States, A FIRM NATIONAL GOVERNMENT; 2d, that this\r\n\r\ngovernment was to be such as would be ADEQUATE TO THE EXIGENCIES\r\n\r\nOF GOVERNMENT and THE PRESERVATION OF THE UNION; 3d, that these\r\n\r\npurposes were to be effected by ALTERATIONS AND PROVISIONS IN THE\r\n\r\nARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION, as it is expressed in the act of\r\n\r\nCongress, or by SUCH FURTHER PROVISIONS AS SHOULD APPEAR\r\n\r\nNECESSARY, as it stands in the recommendatory act from Annapolis;\r\n\r\n4th, that the alterations and provisions were to be reported to\r\n\r\nCongress, and to the States, in order to be agreed to by the\r\n\r\nformer and confirmed by the latter. From a comparison and fair\r\n\r\nconstruction of these several modes of expression, is to be\r\n\r\ndeduced the authority under which the convention acted. They were\r\n\r\nto frame a NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, adequate to the EXIGENCIES OF\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT, and OF THE UNION; and to reduce the articles of\r\n\r\nConfederation into such form as to accomplish these purposes.\r\n\r\nThere are two rules of construction, dictated by plain reason, as\r\n\r\nwell as founded on legal axioms. The one is, that every part of\r\n\r\nthe expression ought, if possible, to be allowed some meaning,\r\n\r\nand be made to conspire to some common end. The other is, that\r\n\r\nwhere the several parts cannot be made to coincide, the less\r\n\r\nimportant should give way to the more important part; the means\r\n\r\nshould be sacrificed to the end, rather than the end to the\r\n\r\nmeans. Suppose, then, that the expressions defining the\r\n\r\nauthority of the convention were irreconcilably at variance with\r\n\r\neach other; that a NATIONAL and ADEQUATE GOVERNMENT could not\r\n\r\npossibly, in the judgment of the convention, be affected by\r\n\r\nALTERATIONS and PROVISIONS in the ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION;\r\n\r\nwhich part of the definition ought to have been embraced, and\r\n\r\nwhich rejected? Which was the more important, which the less\r\n\r\nimportant part? Which the end; which the means? Let the most\r\n\r\nscrupulous expositors of delegated powers; let the most\r\n\r\ninveterate objectors against those exercised by the convention,\r\n\r\nanswer these questions. Let them declare, whether it was of most\r\n\r\nimportance to the happiness of the people of America, that the\r\n\r\narticles of Confederation should be disregarded, and an adequate\r\n\r\ngovernment be provided, and the Union preserved; or that an\r\n\r\nadequate government should be omitted, and the articles of\r\n\r\nConfederation preserved. Let them declare, whether the\r\n\r\npreservation of these articles was the end, for securing which a\r\n\r\nreform of the government was to be introduced as the means; or\r\n\r\nwhether the establishment of a government, adequate to the\r\n\r\nnational happiness, was the end at which these articles\r\n\r\nthemselves originally aimed, and to which they ought, as\r\n\r\ninsufficient means, to have been sacrificed. But is it necessary\r\n\r\nto suppose that these expressions are absolutely irreconcilable\r\n\r\nto each other; that no ALTERATIONS or PROVISIONS in THE ARTICLES\r\n\r\nOF THE CONFEDERATION could possibly mould them into a national\r\n\r\nand adequate government; into such a government as has been\r\n\r\nproposed by the convention? No stress, it is presumed, will, in\r\n\r\nthis case, be laid on the TITLE; a change of that could never be\r\n\r\ndeemed an exercise of ungranted power. ALTERATIONS in the body of\r\n\r\nthe instrument are expressly authorized. NEW PROVISIONS therein\r\n\r\nare also expressly authorized. Here then is a power to change the\r\n\r\ntitle; to insert new articles; to alter old ones. Must it of\r\n\r\nnecessity be admitted that this power is infringed, so long as a\r\n\r\npart of the old articles remain? Those who maintain the\r\n\r\naffirmative ought at least to mark the boundary between\r\n\r\nauthorized and usurped innovations; between that degree of change\r\n\r\nwhich lies within the compass of ALTERATIONS AND FURTHER\r\n\r\nPROVISIONS, and that which amounts to a TRANSMUTATION of the\r\n\r\ngovernment. Will it be said that the alterations ought not to\r\n\r\nhave touched the substance of the Confederation? The States\r\n\r\nwould never have appointed a convention with so much solemnity,\r\n\r\nnor described its objects with so much latitude, if some\r\n\r\nSUBSTANTIAL reform had not been in contemplation. Will it be said\r\n\r\nthat the FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES of the Confederation were not\r\n\r\nwithin the purview of the convention, and ought not to have been\r\n\r\nvaried? I ask, What are these principles? Do they require that,\r\n\r\nin the establishment of the Constitution, the States should be\r\n\r\nregarded as distinct and independent sovereigns? They are so\r\n\r\nregarded by the Constitution proposed. Do they require that the\r\n\r\nmembers of the government should derive their appointment from\r\n\r\nthe legislatures, not from the people of the States? One branch\r\n\r\nof the new government is to be appointed by these legislatures;\r\n\r\nand under the Confederation, the delegates to Congress MAY ALL\r\n\r\nbe appointed immediately by the people, and in two States1 are\r\n\r\nactually so appointed. Do they require that the powers of the\r\n\r\ngovernment should act on the States, and not immediately on\r\n\r\nindividuals? In some instances, as has been shown, the powers of\r\n\r\nthe new government will act on the States in their collective\r\n\r\ncharacters. In some instances, also, those of the existing\r\n\r\ngovernment act immediately on individuals. In cases of capture;\r\n\r\nof piracy; of the post office; of coins, weights, and measures;\r\n\r\nof trade with the Indians; of claims under grants of land by\r\n\r\ndifferent States; and, above all, in the case of trials by\r\n\r\ncourts-marshal in the army and navy, by which death may be\r\n\r\ninflicted without the intervention of a jury, or even of a civil\r\n\r\nmagistrate; in all these cases the powers of the Confederation\r\n\r\noperate immediately on the persons and interests of individual\r\n\r\ncitizens. Do these fundamental principles require, particularly,\r\n\r\nthat no tax should be levied without the intermediate agency of\r\n\r\nthe States? The Confederation itself authorizes a direct tax, to\r\n\r\na certain extent, on the post office. The power of coinage has\r\n\r\nbeen so construed by Congress as to levy a tribute immediately\r\n\r\nfrom that source also. But pretermitting these instances, was it\r\n\r\nnot an acknowledged object of the convention and the universal\r\n\r\nexpectation of the people, that the regulation of trade should be\r\n\r\nsubmitted to the general government in such a form as would\r\n\r\nrender it an immediate source of general revenue? Had not\r\n\r\nCongress repeatedly recommended this measure as not inconsistent\r\n\r\nwith the fundamental principles of the Confederation? Had not\r\n\r\nevery State but one; had not New York herself, so far complied\r\n\r\nwith the plan of Congress as to recognize the PRINCIPLE of the\r\n\r\ninnovation? Do these principles, in fine, require that the\r\n\r\npowers of the general government should be limited, and that,\r\n\r\nbeyond this limit, the States should be left in possession of\r\n\r\ntheir sovereignty and independence? We have seen that in the new\r\n\r\ngovernment, as in the old, the general powers are limited; and\r\n\r\nthat the States, in all unenumerated cases, are left in the\r\n\r\nenjoyment of their sovereign and independent jurisdiction. The\r\n\r\ntruth is, that the great principles of the Constitution proposed\r\n\r\nby the convention may be considered less as absolutely new, than\r\n\r\nas the expansion of principles which are found in the articles of\r\n\r\nConfederation. The misfortune under the latter system has been,\r\n\r\nthat these principles are so feeble and confined as to justify\r\n\r\nall the charges of inefficiency which have been urged against it,\r\n\r\nand to require a degree of enlargement which gives to the new\r\n\r\nsystem the aspect of an entire transformation of the old. In one\r\n\r\nparticular it is admitted that the convention have departed from\r\n\r\nthe tenor of their commission. Instead of reporting a plan\r\n\r\nrequiring the confirmation OF THE LEGISLATURES OF ALL THE STATES,\r\n\r\nthey have reported a plan which is to be confirmed by the PEOPLE,\r\n\r\nand may be carried into effect by NINE STATES ONLY. It is worthy\r\n\r\nof remark that this objection, though the most plausible, has\r\n\r\nbeen the least urged in the publications which have swarmed\r\n\r\nagainst the convention. The forbearance can only have proceeded\r\n\r\nfrom an irresistible conviction of the absurdity of subjecting\r\n\r\nthe fate of twelve States to the perverseness or corruption of a\r\n\r\nthirteenth; from the example of inflexible opposition given by a\r\n\r\nMAJORITY of one sixtieth of the people of America to a measure\r\n\r\napproved and called for by the voice of twelve States, comprising\r\n\r\nfifty-nine sixtieths of the people an example still fresh in the\r\n\r\nmemory and indignation of every citizen who has felt for the\r\n\r\nwounded honor and prosperity of his country. As this objection,\r\n\r\ntherefore, has been in a manner waived by those who have\r\n\r\ncriticised the powers of the convention, I dismiss it without\r\n\r\nfurther observation. The THIRD point to be inquired into is, how\r\n\r\nfar considerations of duty arising out of the case itself could\r\n\r\nhave supplied any defect of regular authority. In the preceding\r\n\r\ninquiries the powers of the convention have been analyzed and\r\n\r\ntried with the same rigor, and by the same rules, as if they had\r\n\r\nbeen real and final powers for the establishment of a\r\n\r\nConstitution for the United States. We have seen in what manner\r\n\r\nthey have borne the trial even on that supposition. It is time\r\n\r\nnow to recollect that the powers were merely advisory and\r\n\r\nrecommendatory; that they were so meant by the States, and so\r\n\r\nunderstood by the convention; and that the latter have\r\n\r\naccordingly planned and proposed a Constitution which is to be of\r\n\r\nno more consequence than the paper on which it is written, unless\r\n\r\nit be stamped with the approbation of those to whom it is\r\n\r\naddressed. This reflection places the subject in a point of view\r\n\r\naltogether different, and will enable us to judge with propriety\r\n\r\nof the course taken by the convention. Let us view the ground on\r\n\r\nwhich the convention stood. It may be collected from their\r\n\r\nproceedings, that they were deeply and unanimously impressed with\r\n\r\nthe crisis, which had led their country almost with one voice to\r\n\r\nmake so singular and solemn an experiment for correcting the\r\n\r\nerrors of a system by which this crisis had been produced; that\r\n\r\nthey were no less deeply and unanimously convinced that such a\r\n\r\nreform as they have proposed was absolutely necessary to effect\r\n\r\nthe purposes of their appointment. It could not be unknown to\r\n\r\nthem that the hopes and expectations of the great body of\r\n\r\ncitizens, throughout this great empire, were turned with the\r\n\r\nkeenest anxiety to the event of their deliberations. They had\r\n\r\nevery reason to believe that the contrary sentiments agitated the\r\n\r\nminds and bosoms of every external and internal foe to the\r\n\r\nliberty and prosperity of the United States. They had seen in the\r\n\r\norigin and progress of the experiment, the alacrity with which\r\n\r\nthe PROPOSITION, made by a single State (Virginia), towards a\r\n\r\npartial amendment of the Confederation, had been attended to and\r\n\r\npromoted. They had seen the LIBERTY ASSUMED by a VERY FEW\r\n\r\ndeputies from a VERY FEW States, convened at Annapolis, of\r\n\r\nrecommending a great and critical object, wholly foreign to their\r\n\r\ncommission, not only justified by the public opinion, but\r\n\r\nactually carried into effect by twelve out of the thirteen\r\n\r\nStates. They had seen, in a variety of instances, assumptions by\r\n\r\nCongress, not only of recommendatory, but of operative, powers,\r\n\r\nwarranted, in the public estimation, by occasions and objects\r\n\r\ninfinitely less urgent than those by which their conduct was to\r\n\r\nbe governed. They must have reflected, that in all great changes\r\n\r\nof established governments, forms ought to give way to substance;\r\n\r\nthat a rigid adherence in such cases to the former, would render\r\n\r\nnominal and nugatory the transcendent and precious right of the\r\n\r\npeople to \"abolish or alter their governments as to them shall\r\n\r\nseem most likely to effect their safety and happiness,\"2 since\r\n\r\nit is impossible for the people spontaneously and universally to\r\n\r\nmove in concert towards their object; and it is therefore\r\n\r\nessential that such changes be instituted by some INFORMAL AND\r\n\r\nUNAUTHORIZED PROPOSITIONS, made by some patriotic and respectable\r\n\r\ncitizen or number of citizens. They must have recollected that it\r\n\r\nwas by this irregular and assumed privilege of proposing to the\r\n\r\npeople plans for their safety and happiness, that the States\r\n\r\nwere first united against the danger with which they were\r\n\r\nthreatened by their ancient government; that committees and\r\n\r\ncongresses were formed for concentrating their efforts and\r\n\r\ndefending their rights; and that CONVENTIONS were ELECTED in THE\r\n\r\nSEVERAL STATES for establishing the constitutions under which\r\n\r\nthey are now governed; nor could it have been forgotten that no\r\n\r\nlittle ill-timed scruples, no zeal for adhering to ordinary\r\n\r\nforms, were anywhere seen, except in those who wished to indulge,\r\n\r\nunder these masks, their secret enmity to the substance contended\r\n\r\nfor. They must have borne in mind, that as the plan to be framed\r\n\r\nand proposed was to be submitted TO THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES, the\r\n\r\ndisapprobation of this supreme authority would destroy it\r\n\r\nforever; its approbation blot out antecedent errors and\r\n\r\nirregularities. It might even have occurred to them, that where a\r\n\r\ndisposition to cavil prevailed, their neglect to execute the\r\n\r\ndegree of power vested in them, and still more their\r\n\r\nrecommendation of any measure whatever, not warranted by their\r\n\r\ncommission, would not less excite animadversion, than a\r\n\r\nrecommendation at once of a measure fully commensurate to the\r\n\r\nnational exigencies. Had the convention, under all these\r\n\r\nimpressions, and in the midst of all these considerations,\r\n\r\ninstead of exercising a manly confidence in their country, by\r\n\r\nwhose confidence they had been so peculiarly distinguished, and\r\n\r\nof pointing out a system capable, in their judgment, of securing\r\n\r\nits happiness, taken the cold and sullen resolution of\r\n\r\ndisappointing its ardent hopes, of sacrificing substance to\r\n\r\nforms, of committing the dearest interests of their country to\r\n\r\nthe uncertainties of delay and the hazard of events, let me ask\r\n\r\nthe man who can raise his mind to one elevated conception, who\r\n\r\ncan awaken in his bosom one patriotic emotion, what judgment\r\n\r\nought to have been pronounced by the impartial world, by the\r\n\r\nfriends of mankind, by every virtuous citizen, on the conduct and\r\n\r\ncharacter of this assembly? Or if there be a man whose\r\n\r\npropensity to condemn is susceptible of no control, let me then\r\n\r\nask what sentence he has in reserve for the twelve States who\r\n\r\nUSURPED THE POWER of sending deputies to the convention, a body\r\n\r\nutterly unknown to their constitutions; for Congress, who\r\n\r\nrecommended the appointment of this body, equally unknown to the\r\n\r\nConfederation; and for the State of New York, in particular,\r\n\r\nwhich first urged and then complied with this unauthorized\r\n\r\ninterposition? But that the objectors may be disarmed of every\r\n\r\npretext, it shall be granted for a moment that the convention\r\n\r\nwere neither authorized by their commission, nor justified by\r\n\r\ncircumstances in proposing a Constitution for their country: does\r\n\r\nit follow that the Constitution ought, for that reason alone, to\r\n\r\nbe rejected? If, according to the noble precept, it be lawful to\r\n\r\naccept good advice even from an enemy, shall we set the ignoble\r\n\r\nexample of refusing such advice even when it is offered by our\r\n\r\nfriends? The prudent inquiry, in all cases, ought surely to be,\r\n\r\nnot so much FROM WHOM the advice comes, as whether the advice be\r\n\r\nGOOD. The sum of what has been here advanced and proved is, that\r\n\r\nthe charge against the convention of exceeding their powers,\r\n\r\nexcept in one instance little urged by the objectors, has no\r\n\r\nfoundation to support it; that if they had exceeded their powers,\r\n\r\nthey were not only warranted, but required, as the confidential\r\n\r\nservants of their country, by the circumstances in which they\r\n\r\nwere placed, to exercise the liberty which they assume; and that\r\n\r\nfinally, if they had violated both their powers and their\r\n\r\nobligations, in proposing a Constitution, this ought nevertheless\r\n\r\nto be embraced, if it be calculated to accomplish the views and\r\n\r\nhappiness of the people of America. How far this character is due\r\n\r\nto the Constitution, is the subject under investigation. PUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConnecticut and Rhode Island. Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 41\r\n\r\nGeneral View of the Powers Conferred by The Constitution\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADISON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTHE Constitution proposed by the convention may be considered\r\n\r\nunder two general points of view. The FIRST relates to the sum or\r\n\r\nquantity of power which it vests in the government, including\r\n\r\nthe restraints imposed on the States. The SECOND, to the\r\n\r\nparticular structure of the government, and the distribution of\r\n\r\nthis power among its several branches. Under the FIRST view of\r\n\r\nthe subject, two important questions arise: 1. Whether any part\r\n\r\nof the powers transferred to the general government be\r\n\r\nunnecessary or improper? 2. Whether the entire mass of them be\r\n\r\ndangerous to the portion of jurisdiction left in the several\r\n\r\nStates? Is the aggregate power of the general government greater\r\n\r\nthan ought to have been vested in it? This is the FIRST\r\n\r\nquestion. It cannot have escaped those who have attended with\r\n\r\ncandor to the arguments employed against the extensive powers of\r\n\r\nthe government, that the authors of them have very little\r\n\r\nconsidered how far these powers were necessary means of attaining\r\n\r\na necessary end. They have chosen rather to dwell on the\r\n\r\ninconveniences which must be unavoidably blended with all\r\n\r\npolitical advantages; and on the possible abuses which must be\r\n\r\nincident to every power or trust, of which a beneficial use can\r\n\r\nbe made. This method of handling the subject cannot impose on the\r\n\r\ngood sense of the people of America. It may display the subtlety\r\n\r\nof the writer; it may open a boundless field for rhetoric and\r\n\r\ndeclamation; it may inflame the passions of the unthinking, and\r\n\r\nmay confirm the prejudices of the misthinking: but cool and\r\n\r\ncandid people will at once reflect, that the purest of human\r\n\r\nblessings must have a portion of alloy in them; that the choice\r\n\r\nmust always be made, if not of the lesser evil, at least of the\r\n\r\nGREATER, not the PERFECT, good; and that in every political\r\n\r\ninstitution, a power to advance the public happiness involves a\r\n\r\ndiscretion which may be misapplied and abused. They will see,\r\n\r\ntherefore, that in all cases where power is to be conferred, the\r\n\r\npoint first to be decided is, whether such a power be necessary\r\n\r\nto the public good; as the next will be, in case of an\r\n\r\naffirmative decision, to guard as effectually as possible\r\n\r\nagainst a perversion of the power to the public detriment. That\r\n\r\nwe may form a correct judgment on this subject, it will be proper\r\n\r\nto review the several powers conferred on the government of the\r\n\r\nUnion; and that this may be the more conveniently done they may\r\n\r\nbe reduced into different classes as they relate to the following\r\n\r\ndifferent objects: 1. Security against foreign danger; 2.\r\n\r\nRegulation of the intercourse with foreign nations; 3.\r\n\r\nMaintenance of harmony and proper intercourse among the States;\r\n\r\n4. Certain miscellaneous objects of general utility; 5.\r\n\r\nRestraint of the States from certain injurious acts; 6.\r\n\r\nProvisions for giving due efficacy to all these powers. The\r\n\r\npowers falling within the FIRST class are those of declaring war\r\n\r\nand granting letters of marque; of providing armies and fleets;\r\n\r\nof regulating and calling forth the militia; of levying and\r\n\r\nborrowing money. Security against foreign danger is one of the\r\n\r\nprimitive objects of civil society. It is an avowed and essential\r\n\r\nobject of the American Union. The powers requisite for attaining\r\n\r\nit must be effectually confided to the federal councils. Is the\r\n\r\npower of declaring war necessary? No man will answer this\r\n\r\nquestion in the negative. It would be superfluous, therefore, to\r\n\r\nenter into a proof of the affirmative. The existing Confederation\r\n\r\nestablishes this power in the most ample form. Is the power of\r\n\r\nraising armies and equipping fleets necessary? This is involved\r\n\r\nin the foregoing power. It is involved in the power of\r\n\r\nself-defense. But was it necessary to give an INDEFINITE POWER\r\n\r\nof raising TROOPS, as well as providing fleets; and of\r\n\r\nmaintaining both in PEACE, as well as in war? The answer to these\r\n\r\nquestions has been too far anticipated in another place to admit\r\n\r\nan extensive discussion of them in this place. The answer indeed\r\n\r\nseems to be so obvious and conclusive as scarcely to justify such\r\n\r\na discussion in any place. With what color of propriety could the\r\n\r\nforce necessary for defense be limited by those who cannot limit\r\n\r\nthe force of offense? If a federal Constitution could chain the\r\n\r\nambition or set bounds to the exertions of all other nations,\r\n\r\nthen indeed might it prudently chain the discretion of its own\r\n\r\ngovernment, and set bounds to the exertions for its own safety.\r\n\r\nHow could a readiness for war in time of peace be safely\r\n\r\nprohibited, unless we could prohibit, in like manner, the\r\n\r\npreparations and establishments of every hostile nation? The\r\n\r\nmeans of security can only be regulated by the means and the\r\n\r\ndanger of attack. They will, in fact, be ever determined by these\r\n\r\nrules, and by no others. It is in vain to oppose constitutional\r\n\r\nbarriers to the impulse of self-preservation. It is worse than in\r\n\r\nvain; because it plants in the Constitution itself necessary\r\n\r\nusurpations of power, every precedent of which is a germ of\r\n\r\nunnecessary and multiplied repetitions. If one nation maintains\r\n\r\nconstantly a disciplined army, ready for the service of ambition\r\n\r\nor revenge, it obliges the most pacific nations who may be within\r\n\r\nthe reach of its enterprises to take corresponding precautions.\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth century was the unhappy epoch of military\r\n\r\nestablishments in the time of peace. They were introduced by\r\n\r\nCharles VII. of France. All Europe has followed, or been forced\r\n\r\ninto, the example. Had the example not been followed by other\r\n\r\nnations, all Europe must long ago have worn the chains of a\r\n\r\nuniversal monarch. Were every nation except France now to disband\r\n\r\nits peace establishments, the same event might follow. The\r\n\r\nveteran legions of Rome were an overmatch for the undisciplined\r\n\r\nvalor of all other nations and rendered her the mistress of the\r\n\r\nworld. Not the less true is it, that the liberties of Rome\r\n\r\nproved the final victim to her military triumphs; and that the\r\n\r\nliberties of Europe, as far as they ever existed, have, with few\r\n\r\nexceptions, been the price of her military establishments. A\r\n\r\nstanding force, therefore, is a dangerous, at the same time that\r\n\r\nit may be a necessary, provision. On the smallest scale it has\r\n\r\nits inconveniences. On an extensive scale its consequences may be\r\n\r\nfatal. On any scale it is an object of laudable circumspection\r\n\r\nand precaution. A wise nation will combine all these\r\n\r\nconsiderations; and, whilst it does not rashly preclude itself\r\n\r\nfrom any resource which may become essential to its safety, will\r\n\r\nexert all its prudence in diminishing both the necessity and the\r\n\r\ndanger of resorting to one which may be inauspicious to its\r\n\r\nliberties. The clearest marks of this prudence are stamped on\r\n\r\nthe proposed Constitution. The Union itself, which it cements and\r\n\r\nsecures, destroys every pretext for a military establishment\r\n\r\nwhich could be dangerous. America united, with a handful of\r\n\r\ntroops, or without a single soldier, exhibits a more forbidding\r\n\r\nposture to foreign ambition than America disunited, with a\r\n\r\nhundred thousand veterans ready for combat. It was remarked, on a\r\n\r\nformer occasion, that the want of this pretext had saved the\r\n\r\nliberties of one nation in Europe. Being rendered by her insular\r\n\r\nsituation and her maritime resources impregnable to the armies of\r\n\r\nher neighbors, the rulers of Great Britain have never been able,\r\n\r\nby real or artificial dangers, to cheat the public into an\r\n\r\nextensive peace establishment. The distance of the United States\r\n\r\nfrom the powerful nations of the world gives them the same happy\r\n\r\nsecurity. A dangerous establishment can never be necessary or\r\n\r\nplausible, so long as they continue a united people. But let it\r\n\r\nnever, for a moment, be forgotten that they are indebted for this\r\n\r\nadvantage to the Union alone. The moment of its dissolution will\r\n\r\nbe the date of a new order of things. The fears of the weaker, or\r\n\r\nthe ambition of the stronger States, or Confederacies, will set\r\n\r\nthe same example in the New, as Charles VII. did in the Old\r\n\r\nWorld. The example will be followed here from the same motives\r\n\r\nwhich produced universal imitation there. Instead of deriving\r\n\r\nfrom our situation the precious advantage which Great Britain has\r\n\r\nderived from hers, the face of America will be but a copy of that\r\n\r\nof the continent of Europe. It will present liberty everywhere\r\n\r\ncrushed between standing armies and perpetual taxes. The fortunes\r\n\r\nof disunited America will be even more disastrous than those of\r\n\r\nEurope. The sources of evil in the latter are confined to her own\r\n\r\nlimits. No superior powers of another quarter of the globe\r\n\r\nintrigue among her rival nations, inflame their mutual\r\n\r\nanimosities, and render them the instruments of foreign ambition,\r\n\r\njealousy, and revenge. In America the miseries springing from her\r\n\r\ninternal jealousies, contentions, and wars, would form a part\r\n\r\nonly of her lot. A plentiful addition of evils would have their\r\n\r\nsource in that relation in which Europe stands to this quarter of\r\n\r\nthe earth, and which no other quarter of the earth bears to\r\n\r\nEurope. This picture of the consequences of disunion cannot be\r\n\r\ntoo highly colored, or too often exhibited. Every man who loves\r\n\r\npeace, every man who loves his country, every man who loves\r\n\r\nliberty, ought to have it ever before his eyes, that he may\r\n\r\ncherish in his heart a due attachment to the Union of America,\r\n\r\nand be able to set a due value on the means of preserving it.\r\n\r\nNext to the effectual establishment of the Union, the best\r\n\r\npossible precaution against danger from standing armies is a\r\n\r\nlimitation of the term for which revenue may be appropriated to\r\n\r\ntheir support. This precaution the Constitution has prudently\r\n\r\nadded. I will not repeat here the observations which I flatter\r\n\r\nmyself have placed this subject in a just and satisfactory\r\n\r\nlight. But it may not be improper to take notice of an argument\r\n\r\nagainst this part of the Constitution, which has been drawn from\r\n\r\nthe policy and practice of Great Britain. It is said that the\r\n\r\ncontinuance of an army in that kingdom requires an annual vote of\r\n\r\nthe legislature; whereas the American Constitution has lengthened\r\n\r\nthis critical period to two years. This is the form in which the\r\n\r\ncomparison is usually stated to the public: but is it a just\r\n\r\nform? Is it a fair comparison? Does the British Constitution\r\n\r\nrestrain the parliamentary discretion to one year? Does the\r\n\r\nAmerican impose on the Congress appropriations for two years? On\r\n\r\nthe contrary, it cannot be unknown to the authors of the fallacy\r\n\r\nthemselves, that the British Constitution fixes no limit whatever\r\n\r\nto the discretion of the legislature, and that the American ties\r\n\r\ndown the legislature to two years, as the longest admissible\r\n\r\nterm. Had the argument from the British example been truly\r\n\r\nstated, it would have stood thus: The term for which supplies\r\n\r\nmay be appropriated to the army establishment, though unlimited\r\n\r\nby the British Constitution, has nevertheless, in practice, been\r\n\r\nlimited by parliamentary discretion to a single year. Now, if in\r\n\r\nGreat Britain, where the House of Commons is elected for seven\r\n\r\nyears; where so great a proportion of the members are elected by\r\n\r\nso small a proportion of the people; where the electors are so\r\n\r\ncorrupted by the representatives, and the representatives so\r\n\r\ncorrupted by the Crown, the representative body can possess a\r\n\r\npower to make appropriations to the army for an indefinite term,\r\n\r\nwithout desiring, or without daring, to extend the term beyond a\r\n\r\nsingle year, ought not suspicion herself to blush, in pretending\r\n\r\nthat the representatives of the United States, elected FREELY by\r\n\r\nthe WHOLE BODY of the people, every SECOND YEAR, cannot be safely\r\n\r\nintrusted with the discretion over such appropriations, expressly\r\n\r\nlimited to the short period of TWO YEARS? A bad cause seldom\r\n\r\nfails to betray itself. Of this truth, the management of the\r\n\r\nopposition to the federal government is an unvaried\r\n\r\nexemplification. But among all the blunders which have been\r\n\r\ncommitted, none is more striking than the attempt to enlist on\r\n\r\nthat side the prudent jealousy entertained by the people, of\r\n\r\nstanding armies. The attempt has awakened fully the public\r\n\r\nattention to that important subject; and has led to\r\n\r\ninvestigations which must terminate in a thorough and universal\r\n\r\nconviction, not only that the constitution has provided the most\r\n\r\neffectual guards against danger from that quarter, but that\r\n\r\nnothing short of a Constitution fully adequate to the national\r\n\r\ndefense and the preservation of the Union, can save America from\r\n\r\nas many standing armies as it may be split into States or\r\n\r\nConfederacies, and from such a progressive augmentation, of these\r\n\r\nestablishments in each, as will render them as burdensome to the\r\n\r\nproperties and ominous to the liberties of the people, as any\r\n\r\nestablishment that can become necessary, under a united and\r\n\r\nefficient government, must be tolerable to the former and safe to\r\n\r\nthe latter. The palpable necessity of the power to provide and\r\n\r\nmaintain a navy has protected that part of the Constitution\r\n\r\nagainst a spirit of censure, which has spared few other parts. It\r\n\r\nmust, indeed, be numbered among the greatest blessings of\r\n\r\nAmerica, that as her Union will be the only source of her\r\n\r\nmaritime strength, so this will be a principal source of her\r\n\r\nsecurity against danger from abroad. In this respect our\r\n\r\nsituation bears another likeness to the insular advantage of\r\n\r\nGreat Britain. The batteries most capable of repelling foreign\r\n\r\nenterprises on our safety, are happily such as can never be\r\n\r\nturned by a perfidious government against our liberties. The\r\n\r\ninhabitants of the Atlantic frontier are all of them deeply\r\n\r\ninterested in this provision for naval protection, and if they\r\n\r\nhave hitherto been suffered to sleep quietly in their beds; if\r\n\r\ntheir property has remained safe against the predatory spirit of\r\n\r\nlicentious adventurers; if their maritime towns have not yet\r\n\r\nbeen compelled to ransom themselves from the terrors of a\r\n\r\nconflagration, by yielding to the exactions of daring and sudden\r\n\r\ninvaders, these instances of good fortune are not to be ascribed\r\n\r\nto the capacity of the existing government for the protection of\r\n\r\nthose from whom it claims allegiance, but to causes that are\r\n\r\nfugitive and fallacious. If we except perhaps Virginia and\r\n\r\nMaryland, which are peculiarly vulnerable on their eastern\r\n\r\nfrontiers, no part of the Union ought to feel more anxiety on\r\n\r\nthis subject than New York. Her seacoast is extensive. A very\r\n\r\nimportant district of the State is an island. The State itself is\r\n\r\npenetrated by a large navigable river for more than fifty\r\n\r\nleagues. The great emporium of its commerce, the great reservoir\r\n\r\nof its wealth, lies every moment at the mercy of events, and may\r\n\r\nalmost be regarded as a hostage for ignominious compliances with\r\n\r\nthe dictates of a foreign enemy, or even with the rapacious\r\n\r\ndemands of pirates and barbarians. Should a war be the result of\r\n\r\nthe precarious situation of European affairs, and all the unruly\r\n\r\npassions attending it be let loose on the ocean, our escape from\r\n\r\ninsults and depredations, not only on that element, but every\r\n\r\npart of the other bordering on it, will be truly miraculous. In\r\n\r\nthe present condition of America, the States more immediately\r\n\r\nexposed to these calamities have nothing to hope from the phantom\r\n\r\nof a general government which now exists; and if their single\r\n\r\nresources were equal to the task of fortifying themselves against\r\n\r\nthe danger, the object to be protected would be almost consumed\r\n\r\nby the means of protecting them. The power of regulating and\r\n\r\ncalling forth the militia has been already sufficiently\r\n\r\nvindicated and explained. The power of levying and borrowing\r\n\r\nmoney, being the sinew of that which is to be exerted in the\r\n\r\nnational defense, is properly thrown into the same class with\r\n\r\nit. This power, also, has been examined already with much\r\n\r\nattention, and has, I trust, been clearly shown to be necessary,\r\n\r\nboth in the extent and form given to it by the Constitution. I\r\n\r\nwill address one additional reflection only to those who contend\r\n\r\nthat the power ought to have been restrained to external\r\n\r\ntaxation by which they mean, taxes on articles imported from\r\n\r\nother countries. It cannot be doubted that this will always be a\r\n\r\nvaluable source of revenue; that for a considerable time it must\r\n\r\nbe a principal source; that at this moment it is an essential\r\n\r\none. But we may form very mistaken ideas on this subject, if we\r\n\r\ndo not call to mind in our calculations, that the extent of\r\n\r\nrevenue drawn from foreign commerce must vary with the\r\n\r\nvariations, both in the extent and the kind of imports; and that\r\n\r\nthese variations do not correspond with the progress of\r\n\r\npopulation, which must be the general measure of the public\r\n\r\nwants. As long as agriculture continues the sole field of labor,\r\n\r\nthe importation of manufactures must increase as the consumers\r\n\r\nmultiply. As soon as domestic manufactures are begun by the hands\r\n\r\nnot called for by agriculture, the imported manufactures will\r\n\r\ndecrease as the numbers of people increase. In a more remote\r\n\r\nstage, the imports may consist in a considerable part of raw\r\n\r\nmaterials, which will be wrought into articles for exportation,\r\n\r\nand will, therefore, require rather the encouragement of\r\n\r\nbounties, than to be loaded with discouraging duties. A system of\r\n\r\ngovernment, meant for duration, ought to contemplate these\r\n\r\nrevolutions, and be able to accommodate itself to them. Some,\r\n\r\nwho have not denied the necessity of the power of taxation, have\r\n\r\ngrounded a very fierce attack against the Constitution, on the\r\n\r\nlanguage in which it is defined. It has been urged and echoed,\r\n\r\nthat the power \"to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and\r\n\r\nexcises, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defense and\r\n\r\ngeneral welfare of the United States,\" amounts to an unlimited\r\n\r\ncommission to exercise every power which may be alleged to be\r\n\r\nnecessary for the common defense or general welfare. No stronger\r\n\r\nproof could be given of the distress under which these writers\r\n\r\nlabor for objections, than their stooping to such a\r\n\r\nmisconstruction. Had no other enumeration or definition of the\r\n\r\npowers of the Congress been found in the Constitution, than the\r\n\r\ngeneral expressions just cited, the authors of the objection\r\n\r\nmight have had some color for it; though it would have been\r\n\r\ndifficult to find a reason for so awkward a form of describing an\r\n\r\nauthority to legislate in all possible cases. A power to destroy\r\n\r\nthe freedom of the press, the trial by jury, or even to regulate\r\n\r\nthe course of descents, or the forms of conveyances, must be very\r\n\r\nsingularly expressed by the terms \"to raise money for the\r\n\r\ngeneral welfare. \"But what color can the objection have, when a\r\n\r\nspecification of the objects alluded to by these general terms\r\n\r\nimmediately follows, and is not even separated by a longer pause\r\n\r\nthan a semicolon? If the different parts of the same instrument\r\n\r\nought to be so expounded, as to give meaning to every part which\r\n\r\nwill bear it, shall one part of the same sentence be excluded\r\n\r\naltogether from a share in the meaning; and shall the more\r\n\r\ndoubtful and indefinite terms be retained in their full extent,\r\n\r\nand the clear and precise expressions be denied any signification\r\n\r\nwhatsoever? For what purpose could the enumeration of particular\r\n\r\npowers be inserted, if these and all others were meant to be\r\n\r\nincluded in the preceding general power? Nothing is more natural\r\n\r\nnor common than first to use a general phrase, and then to\r\n\r\nexplain and qualify it by a recital of particulars. But the idea\r\n\r\nof an enumeration of particulars which neither explain nor\r\n\r\nqualify the general meaning, and can have no other effect than to\r\n\r\nconfound and mislead, is an absurdity, which, as we are reduced\r\n\r\nto the dilemma of charging either on the authors of the objection\r\n\r\nor on the authors of the Constitution, we must take the liberty\r\n\r\nof supposing, had not its origin with the latter. The objection\r\n\r\nhere is the more extraordinary, as it appears that the language\r\n\r\nused by the convention is a copy from the articles of\r\n\r\nConfederation. The objects of the Union among the States, as\r\n\r\ndescribed in article third, are \"their common defense, security\r\n\r\nof their liberties, and mutual and general welfare. \" The terms\r\n\r\nof article eighth are still more identical: \"All charges of war\r\n\r\nand all other expenses that shall be incurred for the common\r\n\r\ndefense or general welfare, and allowed by the United States in\r\n\r\nCongress, shall be defrayed out of a common treasury,\" etc. A\r\n\r\nsimilar language again occurs in article ninth. Construe either\r\n\r\nof these articles by the rules which would justify the\r\n\r\nconstruction put on the new Constitution, and they vest in the\r\n\r\nexisting Congress a power to legislate in all cases whatsoever.\r\n\r\nBut what would have been thought of that assembly, if, attaching\r\n\r\nthemselves to these general expressions, and disregarding the\r\n\r\nspecifications which ascertain and limit their import, they had\r\n\r\nexercised an unlimited power of providing for the common defense\r\n\r\nand general welfare? I appeal to the objectors themselves,\r\n\r\nwhether they would in that case have employed the same reasoning\r\n\r\nin justification of Congress as they now make use of against the\r\n\r\nconvention. How difficult it is for error to escape its own\r\n\r\ncondemnation! PUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 42\r\n\r\nThe Powers Conferred by the Constitution Further Considered\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, January 22, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADISON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND class of powers, lodged in the general government,\r\n\r\nconsists of those which regulate the intercourse with foreign\r\n\r\nnations, to wit: to make treaties; to send and receive\r\n\r\nambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls; to define and\r\n\r\npunish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and\r\n\r\noffenses against the law of nations; to regulate foreign\r\n\r\ncommerce, including a power to prohibit, after the year 1808, the\r\n\r\nimportation of slaves, and to lay an intermediate duty of ten\r\n\r\ndollars per head, as a discouragement to such importations. This\r\n\r\nclass of powers forms an obvious and essential branch of the\r\n\r\nfederal administration. If we are to be one nation in any\r\n\r\nrespect, it clearly ought to be in respect to other nations. The\r\n\r\npowers to make treaties and to send and receive ambassadors,\r\n\r\nspeak their own propriety. Both of them are comprised in the\r\n\r\narticles of Confederation, with this difference only, that the\r\n\r\nformer is disembarrassed, by the plan of the convention, of an\r\n\r\nexception, under which treaties might be substantially frustrated\r\n\r\nby regulations of the States; and that a power of appointing and\r\n\r\nreceiving \"other public ministers and consuls,\" is expressly\r\n\r\nand very properly added to the former provision concerning\r\n\r\nambassadors. The term ambassador, if taken strictly, as seems to\r\n\r\nbe required by the second of the articles of Confederation,\r\n\r\ncomprehends the highest grade only of public ministers, and\r\n\r\nexcludes the grades which the United States will be most likely\r\n\r\nto prefer, where foreign embassies may be necessary. And under no\r\n\r\nlatitude of construction will the term comprehend consuls. Yet it\r\n\r\nhas been found expedient, and has been the practice of Congress,\r\n\r\nto employ the inferior grades of public ministers, and to send\r\n\r\nand receive consuls. It is true, that where treaties of commerce\r\n\r\nstipulate for the mutual appointment of consuls, whose functions\r\n\r\nare connected with commerce, the admission of foreign consuls may\r\n\r\nfall within the power of making commercial treaties; and that\r\n\r\nwhere no such treaties exist, the mission of American consuls\r\n\r\ninto foreign countries may PERHAPS be covered under the\r\n\r\nauthority, given by the ninth article of the Confederation, to\r\n\r\nappoint all such civil officers as may be necessary for managing\r\n\r\nthe general affairs of the United States. But the admission of\r\n\r\nconsuls into the United States, where no previous treaty has\r\n\r\nstipulated it, seems to have been nowhere provided for. A supply\r\n\r\nof the omission is one of the lesser instances in which the\r\n\r\nconvention have improved on the model before them. But the most\r\n\r\nminute provisions become important when they tend to obviate the\r\n\r\nnecessity or the pretext for gradual and unobserved usurpations\r\n\r\nof power. A list of the cases in which Congress have been\r\n\r\nbetrayed, or forced by the defects of the Confederation, into\r\n\r\nviolations of their chartered authorities, would not a little\r\n\r\nsurprise those who have paid no attention to the subject; and\r\n\r\nwould be no inconsiderable argument in favor of the new\r\n\r\nConstitution, which seems to have provided no less studiously for\r\n\r\nthe lesser, than the more obvious and striking defects of the\r\n\r\nold. The power to define and punish piracies and felonies\r\n\r\ncommitted on the high seas, and offenses against the law of\r\n\r\nnations, belongs with equal propriety to the general government,\r\n\r\nand is a still greater improvement on the articles of\r\n\r\nConfederation. These articles contain no provision for the case\r\n\r\nof offenses against the law of nations; and consequently leave\r\n\r\nit in the power of any indiscreet member to embroil the\r\n\r\nConfederacy with foreign nations. The provision of the federal\r\n\r\narticles on the subject of piracies and felonies extends no\r\n\r\nfurther than to the establishment of courts for the trial of\r\n\r\nthese offenses. The definition of piracies might, perhaps,\r\n\r\nwithout inconveniency, be left to the law of nations; though a\r\n\r\nlegislative definition of them is found in most municipal codes.\r\n\r\nA definition of felonies on the high seas is evidently\r\n\r\nrequisite. Felony is a term of loose signification, even in the\r\n\r\ncommon law of England; and of various import in the statute law\r\n\r\nof that kingdom. But neither the common nor the statute law of\r\n\r\nthat, or of any other nation, ought to be a standard for the\r\n\r\nproceedings of this, unless previously made its own by\r\n\r\nlegislative adoption. The meaning of the term, as defined in the\r\n\r\ncodes of the several States, would be as impracticable as the\r\n\r\nformer would be a dishonorable and illegitimate guide. It is not\r\n\r\nprecisely the same in any two of the States; and varies in each\r\n\r\nwith every revision of its criminal laws. For the sake of\r\n\r\ncertainty and uniformity, therefore, the power of defining\r\n\r\nfelonies in this case was in every respect necessary and proper.\r\n\r\nThe regulation of foreign commerce, having fallen within several\r\n\r\nviews which have been taken of this subject, has been too fully\r\n\r\ndiscussed to need additional proofs here of its being properly\r\n\r\nsubmitted to the federal administration. It were doubtless to be\r\n\r\nwished, that the power of prohibiting the importation of slaves\r\n\r\nhad not been postponed until the year 1808, or rather that it had\r\n\r\nbeen suffered to have immediate operation. But it is not\r\n\r\ndifficult to account, either for this restriction on the general\r\n\r\ngovernment, or for the manner in which the whole clause is\r\n\r\nexpressed. It ought to be considered as a great point gained in\r\n\r\nfavor of humanity, that a period of twenty years may terminate\r\n\r\nforever, within these States, a traffic which has so long and so\r\n\r\nloudly upbraided the barbarism of modern policy; that within that\r\n\r\nperiod, it will receive a considerable discouragement from the\r\n\r\nfederal government, and may be totally abolished, by a\r\n\r\nconcurrence of the few States which continue the unnatural\r\n\r\ntraffic, in the prohibitory example which has been given by so\r\n\r\ngreat a majority of the Union. Happy would it be for the\r\n\r\nunfortunate Africans, if an equal prospect lay before them of\r\n\r\nbeing redeemed from the oppressions of their European brethren!\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made to pervert this clause into an objection\r\n\r\nagainst the Constitution, by representing it on one side as a\r\n\r\ncriminal toleration of an illicit practice, and on another as\r\n\r\ncalculated to prevent voluntary and beneficial emigrations from\r\n\r\nEurope to America. I mention these misconstructions, not with a\r\n\r\nview to give them an answer, for they deserve none, but as\r\n\r\nspecimens of the manner and spirit in which some have thought fit\r\n\r\nto conduct their opposition to the proposed government. The\r\n\r\npowers included in the THIRD class are those which provide for\r\n\r\nthe harmony and proper intercourse among the States. Under this\r\n\r\nhead might be included the particular restraints imposed on the\r\n\r\nauthority of the States, and certain powers of the judicial\r\n\r\ndepartment; but the former are reserved for a distinct class, and\r\n\r\nthe latter will be particularly examined when we arrive at the\r\n\r\nstructure and organization of the government. I shall confine\r\n\r\nmyself to a cursory review of the remaining powers comprehended\r\n\r\nunder this third description, to wit: to regulate commerce among\r\n\r\nthe several States and the Indian tribes; to coin money, regulate\r\n\r\nthe value thereof, and of foreign coin; to provide for the\r\n\r\npunishment of counterfeiting the current coin and secureties of\r\n\r\nthe United States; to fix the standard of weights and measures;\r\n\r\nto establish a uniform rule of naturalization, and uniform laws\r\n\r\nof bankruptcy, to prescribe the manner in which the public acts,\r\n\r\nrecords, and judicial proceedings of each State shall be proved,\r\n\r\nand the effect they shall have in other States; and to establish\r\n\r\npost offices and post roads. The defect of power in the existing\r\n\r\nConfederacy to regulate the commerce between its several members,\r\n\r\nis in the number of those which have been clearly pointed out by\r\n\r\nexperience. To the proofs and remarks which former papers have\r\n\r\nbrought into view on this subject, it may be added that without\r\n\r\nthis supplemental provision, the great and essential power of\r\n\r\nregulating foreign commerce would have been incomplete and\r\n\r\nineffectual. A very material object of this power was the relief\r\n\r\nof the States which import and export through other States, from\r\n\r\nthe improper contributions levied on them by the latter. Were\r\n\r\nthese at liberty to regulate the trade between State and State,\r\n\r\nit must be foreseen that ways would be found out to load the\r\n\r\narticles of import and export, during the passage through their\r\n\r\njurisdiction, with duties which would fall on the makers of the\r\n\r\nlatter and the consumers of the former. We may be assured by past\r\n\r\nexperience, that such a practice would be introduced by future\r\n\r\ncontrivances; and both by that and a common knowledge of human\r\n\r\naffairs, that it would nourish unceasing animosities, and not\r\n\r\nimprobably terminate in serious interruptions of the public\r\n\r\ntranquillity. To those who do not view the question through the\r\n\r\nmedium of passion or of interest, the desire of the commercial\r\n\r\nStates to collect, in any form, an indirect revenue from their\r\n\r\nuncommercial neighbors, must appear not less impolitic than it is\r\n\r\nunfair; since it would stimulate the injured party, by resentment\r\n\r\nas well as interest, to resort to less convenient channels for\r\n\r\ntheir foreign trade. But the mild voice of reason, pleading the\r\n\r\ncause of an enlarged and permanent interest, is but too often\r\n\r\ndrowned, before public bodies as well as individuals, by the\r\n\r\nclamors of an impatient avidity for immediate and immoderate\r\n\r\ngain. The necessity of a superintending authority over the\r\n\r\nreciprocal trade of confederated States, has been illustrated by\r\n\r\nother examples as well as our own. In Switzerland, where the\r\n\r\nUnion is so very slight, each canton is obliged to allow to\r\n\r\nmerchandises a passage through its jurisdiction into other\r\n\r\ncantons, without an augmentation of the tolls. In Germany it is a\r\n\r\nlaw of the empire, that the princes and states shall not lay\r\n\r\ntolls or customs on bridges, rivers, or passages, without the\r\n\r\nconsent of the emperor and the diet; though it appears from a\r\n\r\nquotation in an antecedent paper, that the practice in this, as\r\n\r\nin many other instances in that confederacy, has not followed the\r\n\r\nlaw, and has produced there the mischiefs which have been\r\n\r\nforeseen here. Among the restraints imposed by the Union of the\r\n\r\nNetherlands on its members, one is, that they shall not establish\r\n\r\nimposts disadvantageous to their neighbors, without the general\r\n\r\npermission. The regulation of commerce with the Indian tribes is\r\n\r\nvery properly unfettered from two limitations in the articles of\r\n\r\nConfederation, which render the provision obscure and\r\n\r\ncontradictory. The power is there restrained to Indians, not\r\n\r\nmembers of any of the States, and is not to violate or infringe\r\n\r\nthe legislative right of any State within its own limits. What\r\n\r\ndescription of Indians are to be deemed members of a State, is\r\n\r\nnot yet settled, and has been a question of frequent perplexity\r\n\r\nand contention in the federal councils. And how the trade with\r\n\r\nIndians, though not members of a State, yet residing within its\r\n\r\nlegislative jurisdiction, can be regulated by an external\r\n\r\nauthority, without so far intruding on the internal rights of\r\n\r\nlegislation, is absolutely incomprehensible. This is not the only\r\n\r\ncase in which the articles of Confederation have inconsiderately\r\n\r\nendeavored to accomplish impossibilities; to reconcile a partial\r\n\r\nsovereignty in the Union, with complete sovereignty in the\r\n\r\nStates; to subvert a mathematical axiom, by taking away a part,\r\n\r\nand letting the whole remain. All that need be remarked on the\r\n\r\npower to coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign\r\n\r\ncoin, is, that by providing for this last case, the Constitution\r\n\r\nhas supplied a material omission in the articles of\r\n\r\nConfederation. The authority of the existing Congress is\r\n\r\nrestrained to the regulation of coin STRUCK by their own\r\n\r\nauthority, or that of the respective States. It must be seen at\r\n\r\nonce that the proposed uniformity in the VALUE of the current\r\n\r\ncoin might be destroyed by subjecting that of foreign coin to the\r\n\r\ndifferent regulations of the different States. The punishment of\r\n\r\ncounterfeiting the public securities, as well as the current\r\n\r\ncoin, is submitted of course to that authority which is to secure\r\n\r\nthe value of both. The regulation of weights and measures is\r\n\r\ntransferred from the articles of Confederation, and is founded on\r\n\r\nlike considerations with the preceding power of regulating coin.\r\n\r\nThe dissimilarity in the rules of naturalization has long been\r\n\r\nremarked as a fault in our system, and as laying a foundation for\r\n\r\nintricate and delicate questions. In the fourth article of the\r\n\r\nConfederation, it is declared \"that the FREE INHABITANTS of each\r\n\r\nof these States, paupers, vagabonds, and fugitives from justice,\r\n\r\nexcepted, shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of\r\n\r\nFREE CITIZENS in the several States; and THE PEOPLE of each State\r\n\r\nshall, in every other, enjoy all the privileges of trade and\r\n\r\ncommerce,\" etc. There is a confusion of language here, which is\r\n\r\nremarkable. Why the terms FREE INHABITANTS are used in one part\r\n\r\nof the article, FREE CITIZENS in another, and PEOPLE in another;\r\n\r\nor what was meant by superadding to \"all privileges and\r\n\r\nimmunities of free citizens,\" \"all the privileges of trade and\r\n\r\ncommerce,\"\r\n\r\ncannot easily be determined. It seems to be a construction\r\n\r\nscarcely avoidable, however, that those who come under the\r\n\r\ndenomination of FREE INHABITANTS of a State, although not\r\n\r\ncitizens of such State, are entitled, in every other State, to\r\n\r\nall the privileges of FREE CITIZENS of the latter; that is, to\r\n\r\ngreater privileges than they may be entitled to in their own\r\n\r\nState: so that it may be in the power of a particular State, or\r\n\r\nrather every State is laid under a necessity, not only to confer\r\n\r\nthe rights of citizenship in other States upon any whom it may\r\n\r\nadmit to such rights within itself, but upon any whom it may\r\n\r\nallow to become inhabitants within its jurisdiction. But were an\r\n\r\nexposition of the term \"inhabitants\" to be admitted which\r\n\r\nwould confine the stipulated privileges to citizens alone, the\r\n\r\ndifficulty is diminished only, not removed. The very improper\r\n\r\npower would still be retained by each State, of naturalizing\r\n\r\naliens in every other State. In one State, residence for a short\r\n\r\nterm confirms all the rights of citizenship: in another,\r\n\r\nqualifications of greater importance are required. An alien,\r\n\r\ntherefore, legally incapacitated for certain rights in the\r\n\r\nlatter, may, by previous residence only in the former, elude his\r\n\r\nincapacity; and thus the law of one State be preposterously\r\n\r\nrendered paramount to the law of another, within the jurisdiction\r\n\r\nof the other. We owe it to mere casualty, that very serious\r\n\r\nembarrassments on this subject have been hitherto escaped. By the\r\n\r\nlaws of several States, certain descriptions of aliens, who had\r\n\r\nrendered themselves obnoxious, were laid under interdicts\r\n\r\ninconsistent not only with the rights of citizenship but with the\r\n\r\nprivilege of residence. What would have been the consequence, if\r\n\r\nsuch persons, by residence or otherwise, had acquired the\r\n\r\ncharacter of citizens under the laws of another State, and then\r\n\r\nasserted their rights as such, both to residence and citizenship,\r\n\r\nwithin the State proscribing them? Whatever the legal\r\n\r\nconsequences might have been, other consequences would probably\r\n\r\nhave resulted, of too serious a nature not to be provided\r\n\r\nagainst. The new Constitution has accordingly, with great\r\n\r\npropriety, made provision against them, and all others proceeding\r\n\r\nfrom the defect of the Confederation on this head, by authorizing\r\n\r\nthe general government to establish a uniform rule of\r\n\r\nnaturalization throughout the United States. The power of\r\n\r\nestablishing uniform laws of bankruptcy is so intimately\r\n\r\nconnected with the regulation of commerce, and will prevent so\r\n\r\nmany frauds where the parties or their property may lie or be\r\n\r\nremoved into different States, that the expediency of it seems\r\n\r\nnot likely to be drawn into question. The power of prescribing\r\n\r\nby general laws, the manner in which the public acts, records and\r\n\r\njudicial proceedings of each State shall be proved, and the\r\n\r\neffect they shall have in other States, is an evident and\r\n\r\nvaluable improvement on the clause relating to this subject in\r\n\r\nthe articles of Confederation. The meaning of the latter is\r\n\r\nextremely indeterminate, and can be of little importance under\r\n\r\nany interpretation which it will bear. The power here established\r\n\r\nmay be rendered a very convenient instrument of justice, and be\r\n\r\nparticularly beneficial on the borders of contiguous States,\r\n\r\nwhere the effects liable to justice may be suddenly and secretly\r\n\r\ntranslated, in any stage of the process, within a foreign\r\n\r\njurisdiction. The power of establishing post roads must, in\r\n\r\nevery view, be a harmless power, and may, perhaps, by judicious\r\n\r\nmanagement, become productive of great public conveniency.\r\n\r\nNothing which tends to facilitate the intercourse between the\r\n\r\nStates can be deemed unworthy of the public care. PUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 43\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued (The Powers Conferred by the\r\n\r\nConstitution Further Considered)\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADISON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTH class comprises the following miscellaneous powers:1.\r\n\r\nA power \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by\r\n\r\nsecuring, for a limited time, to authors and inventors, the\r\n\r\nexclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.\r\n\r\n\"The utility of this power will scarcely be questioned. The\r\n\r\ncopyright of authors has been solemnly adjudged, in Great\r\n\r\nBritain, to be a right of common law. The right to useful\r\n\r\ninventions seems with equal reason to belong to the inventors.\r\n\r\nThe public good fully coincides in both cases with the claims of\r\n\r\nindividuals. The States cannot separately make effectual\r\n\r\nprovisions for either of the cases, and most of them have\r\n\r\nanticipated the decision of this point, by laws passed at the\r\n\r\ninstance of Congress. 2. \"To exercise exclusive legislation, in\r\n\r\nall cases whatsoever, over such district (not exceeding ten miles\r\n\r\nsquare) as may, by cession of particular States and the\r\n\r\nacceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the\r\n\r\nUnited States; and to exercise like authority over all places\r\n\r\npurchased by the consent of the legislatures of the States in\r\n\r\nwhich the same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines,\r\n\r\narsenals, dockyards, and other needful buildings. \"The\r\n\r\nindispensable necessity of complete authority at the seat of\r\n\r\ngovernment, carries its own evidence with it. It is a power\r\n\r\nexercised by every legislature of the Union, I might say of the\r\n\r\nworld, by virtue of its general supremacy. Without it, not only\r\n\r\nthe public authority might be insulted and its proceedings\r\n\r\ninterrupted with impunity; but a dependence of the members of the\r\n\r\ngeneral government on the State comprehending the seat of the\r\n\r\ngovernment, for protection in the exercise of their duty, might\r\n\r\nbring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence,\r\n\r\nequally dishonorable to the government and dissatisfactory to the\r\n\r\nother members of the Confederacy. This consideration has the more\r\n\r\nweight, as the gradual accumulation of public improvements at the\r\n\r\nstationary residence of the government would be both too great a\r\n\r\npublic pledge to be left in the hands of a single State, and\r\n\r\nwould create so many obstacles to a removal of the government, as\r\n\r\nstill further to abridge its necessary independence. The extent\r\n\r\nof this federal district is sufficiently circumscribed to satisfy\r\n\r\nevery jealousy of an opposite nature. And as it is to be\r\n\r\nappropriated to this use with the consent of the State ceding it;\r\n\r\nas the State will no doubt provide in the compact for the rights\r\n\r\nand the consent of the citizens inhabiting it; as the inhabitants\r\n\r\nwill find sufficient inducements of interest to become willing\r\n\r\nparties to the cession; as they will have had their voice in the\r\n\r\nelection of the government which is to exercise authority over\r\n\r\nthem; as a municipal legislature for local purposes, derived from\r\n\r\ntheir own suffrages, will of course be allowed them; and as the\r\n\r\nauthority of the legislature of the State, and of the inhabitants\r\n\r\nof the ceded part of it, to concur in the cession, will be\r\n\r\nderived from the whole people of the State in their adoption of\r\n\r\nthe Constitution, every imaginable objection seems to be\r\n\r\nobviated. The necessity of a like authority over forts,\r\n\r\nmagazines, etc., established by the general government, is not\r\n\r\nless evident. The public money expended on such places, and the\r\n\r\npublic property deposited in them, requires that they should be\r\n\r\nexempt from the authority of the particular State. Nor would it\r\n\r\nbe proper for the places on which the security of the entire\r\n\r\nUnion may depend, to be in any degree dependent on a particular\r\n\r\nmember of it. All objections and scruples are here also obviated,\r\n\r\nby requiring the concurrence of the States concerned, in every\r\n\r\nsuch establishment. 3. \"To declare the punishment of treason,\r\n\r\nbut no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or\r\n\r\nforfeiture, except during the life of the person attained. \"As\r\n\r\ntreason may be committed against the United States, the authority\r\n\r\nof the United States ought to be enabled to punish it. But as\r\n\r\nnew-fangled and artificial treasons have been the great engines\r\n\r\nby which violent factions, the natural offspring of free\r\n\r\ngovernment, have usually wreaked their alternate malignity on\r\n\r\neach other, the convention have, with great judgment, opposed a\r\n\r\nbarrier to this peculiar danger, by inserting a constitutional\r\n\r\ndefinition of the crime, fixing the proof necessary for\r\n\r\nconviction of it, and restraining the Congress, even in punishing\r\n\r\nit, from extending the consequences of guilt beyond the person of\r\n\r\nits author. 4. \"To admit new States into the Union; but no new\r\n\r\nState shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any\r\n\r\nother State; nor any State be formed by the junction of two or\r\n\r\nmore States, or parts of States, without the consent of the\r\n\r\nlegislatures of the States concerned, as well as of the Congress.\r\n\r\n\"In the articles of Confederation, no provision is found on this\r\n\r\nimportant subject. Canada was to be admitted of right, on her\r\n\r\njoining in the measures of the United States; and the other\r\n\r\nCOLONIES, by which were evidently meant the other British\r\n\r\ncolonies, at the discretion of nine States. The eventual\r\n\r\nestablishment of NEW STATES seems to have been overlooked by the\r\n\r\ncompilers of that instrument. We have seen the inconvenience of\r\n\r\nthis omission, and the assumption of power into which Congress\r\n\r\nhave been led by it. With great propriety, therefore, has the new\r\n\r\nsystem supplied the defect. The general precaution, that no new\r\n\r\nStates shall be formed, without the concurrence of the federal\r\n\r\nauthority, and that of the States concerned, is consonant to the\r\n\r\nprinciples which ought to govern such transactions. The\r\n\r\nparticular precaution against the erection of new States, by the\r\n\r\npartition of a State without its consent, quiets the jealousy of\r\n\r\nthe larger States; as that of the smaller is quieted by a like\r\n\r\nprecaution, against a junction of States without their consent.\r\n\r\n5. \"To dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations\r\n\r\nrespecting the territory or other property belonging to the\r\n\r\nUnited States, with a proviso, that nothing in the Constitution\r\n\r\nshall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United\r\n\r\nStates, or of any particular State. \"This is a power of very\r\n\r\ngreat importance, and required by considerations similar to those\r\n\r\nwhich show the propriety of the former. The proviso annexed is\r\n\r\nproper in itself, and was probably rendered absolutely necessary\r\n\r\nby jealousies and questions concerning the Western territory\r\n\r\nsufficiently known to the public. 6. \"To guarantee to every\r\n\r\nState in the Union a republican form of government; to protect\r\n\r\neach of them against invasion; and on application of the\r\n\r\nlegislature, or of the executive (when the legislature cannot be\r\n\r\nconvened), against domestic violence. \"In a confederacy founded\r\n\r\non republican principles, and composed of republican members, the\r\n\r\nsuperintending government ought clearly to possess authority to\r\n\r\ndefend the system against aristocratic or monarchial\r\n\r\ninnovations. The more intimate the nature of such a union may be,\r\n\r\nthe greater interest have the members in the political\r\n\r\ninstitutions of each other; and the greater right to insist that\r\n\r\nthe forms of government under which the compact was entered into\r\n\r\nshould be SUBSTANTIALLY maintained. But a right implies a remedy;\r\n\r\nand where else could the remedy be deposited, than where it is\r\n\r\ndeposited by the Constitution? Governments of dissimilar\r\n\r\nprinciples and forms have been found less adapted to a federal\r\n\r\ncoalition of any sort, than those of a kindred nature. \"As the\r\n\r\nconfederate republic of Germany,\" says Montesquieu, \"consists\r\n\r\nof free cities and petty states, subject to different princes,\r\n\r\nexperience shows us that it is more imperfect than that of\r\n\r\nHolland and Switzerland. \" \"Greece was undone,\" he adds, \"as\r\n\r\nsoon as the king of Macedon obtained a seat among the\r\n\r\nAmphictyons. \" In the latter case, no doubt, the\r\n\r\ndisproportionate force, as well as the monarchical form, of the\r\n\r\nnew confederate, had its share of influence on the events. It may\r\n\r\npossibly be asked, what need there could be of such a\r\n\r\nprecaution, and whether it may not become a pretext for\r\n\r\nalterations in the State governments, without the concurrence of\r\n\r\nthe States themselves. These questions admit of ready answers. If\r\n\r\nthe interposition of the general government should not be\r\n\r\nneeded, the provision for such an event will be a harmless\r\n\r\nsuperfluity only in the Constitution. But who can say what\r\n\r\nexperiments may be produced by the caprice of particular States,\r\n\r\nby the ambition of enterprising leaders, or by the intrigues and\r\n\r\ninfluence of foreign powers? To the second question it may be\r\n\r\nanswered, that if the general government should interpose by\r\n\r\nvirtue of this constitutional authority, it will be, of course,\r\n\r\nbound to pursue the authority. But the authority extends no\r\n\r\nfurther than to a GUARANTY of a republican form of government,\r\n\r\nwhich supposes a pre-existing government of the form which is to\r\n\r\nbe guaranteed. As long, therefore, as the existing republican\r\n\r\nforms are continued by the States, they are guaranteed by the\r\n\r\nfederal Constitution. Whenever the States may choose to\r\n\r\nsubstitute other republican forms, they have a right to do so,\r\n\r\nand to claim the federal guaranty for the latter. The only\r\n\r\nrestriction imposed on them is, that they shall not exchange\r\n\r\nrepublican for antirepublican Constitutions; a restriction\r\n\r\nwhich, it is presumed, will hardly be considered as a grievance.\r\n\r\nA protection against invasion is due from every society to the\r\n\r\nparts composing it. The latitude of the expression here used\r\n\r\nseems to secure each State, not only against foreign hostility,\r\n\r\nbut against ambitious or vindictive enterprises of its more\r\n\r\npowerful neighbors. The history, both of ancient and modern\r\n\r\nconfederacies, proves that the weaker members of the union ought\r\n\r\nnot to be insensible to the policy of this article. Protection\r\n\r\nagainst domestic violence is added with equal propriety. It has\r\n\r\nbeen remarked, that even among the Swiss cantons, which, properly\r\n\r\nspeaking, are not under one government, provision is made for\r\n\r\nthis object; and the history of that league informs us that\r\n\r\nmutual aid is frequently claimed and afforded; and as well by\r\n\r\nthe most democratic, as the other cantons. A recent and\r\n\r\nwell-known event among ourselves has warned us to be prepared for\r\n\r\nemergencies of a like nature. At first view, it might seem not\r\n\r\nto square with the republican theory, to suppose, either that a\r\n\r\nmajority have not the right, or that a minority will have the\r\n\r\nforce, to subvert a government; and consequently, that the\r\n\r\nfederal interposition can never be required, but when it would be\r\n\r\nimproper. But theoretic reasoning, in this as in most other\r\n\r\ncases, must be qualified by the lessons of practice. Why may not\r\n\r\nillicit combinations, for purposes of violence, be formed as\r\n\r\nwell by a majority of a State, especially a small State as by a\r\n\r\nmajority of a county, or a district of the same State; and if\r\n\r\nthe authority of the State ought, in the latter case, to protect\r\n\r\nthe local magistracy, ought not the federal authority, in the\r\n\r\nformer, to support the State authority? Besides, there are\r\n\r\ncertain parts of the State constitutions which are so interwoven\r\n\r\nwith the federal Constitution, that a violent blow cannot be\r\n\r\ngiven to the one without communicating the wound to the other.\r\n\r\nInsurrections in a State will rarely induce a federal\r\n\r\ninterposition, unless the number concerned in them bear some\r\n\r\nproportion to the friends of government. It will be much better\r\n\r\nthat the violence in such cases should be repressed by the\r\n\r\nsuperintending power, than that the majority should be left to\r\n\r\nmaintain their cause by a bloody and obstinate contest. The\r\n\r\nexistence of a right to interpose, will generally prevent the\r\n\r\nnecessity of exerting it. Is it true that force and right are\r\n\r\nnecessarily on the same side in republican governments? May not\r\n\r\nthe minor party possess such a superiority of pecuniary\r\n\r\nresources, of military talents and experience, or of secret\r\n\r\nsuccors from foreign powers, as will render it superior also in\r\n\r\nan appeal to the sword? May not a more compact and advantageous\r\n\r\nposition turn the scale on the same side, against a superior\r\n\r\nnumber so situated as to be less capable of a prompt and\r\n\r\ncollected exertion of its strength? Nothing can be more\r\n\r\nchimerical than to imagine that in a trial of actual force,\r\n\r\nvictory may be calculated by the rules which prevail in a census\r\n\r\nof the inhabitants, or which determine the event of an election!\r\n\r\nMay it not happen, in fine, that the minority of CITIZENS may\r\n\r\nbecome a majority of PERSONS, by the accession of alien\r\n\r\nresidents, of a casual concourse of adventurers, or of those whom\r\n\r\nthe constitution of the State has not admitted to the rights of\r\n\r\nsuffrage? I take no notice of an unhappy species of population\r\n\r\nabounding in some of the States, who, during the calm of regular\r\n\r\ngovernment, are sunk below the level of men; but who, in the\r\n\r\ntempestuous scenes of civil violence, may emerge into the human\r\n\r\ncharacter, and give a superiority of strength to any party with\r\n\r\nwhich they may associate themselves. In cases where it may be\r\n\r\ndoubtful on which side justice lies, what better umpires could\r\n\r\nbe desired by two violent factions, flying to arms, and tearing a\r\n\r\nState to pieces, than the representatives of confederate States,\r\n\r\nnot heated by the local flame? To the impartiality of judges,\r\n\r\nthey would unite the affection of friends. Happy would it be if\r\n\r\nsuch a remedy for its infirmities could be enjoyed by all free\r\n\r\ngovernments; if a project equally effectual could be established\r\n\r\nfor the universal peace of mankind! Should it be asked, what is\r\n\r\nto be the redress for an insurrection pervading all the States,\r\n\r\nand comprising a superiority of the entire force, though not a\r\n\r\nconstitutional right? the answer must be, that such a case, as\r\n\r\nit would be without the compass of human remedies, so it is\r\n\r\nfortunately not within the compass of human probability; and\r\n\r\nthat it is a sufficient recommendation of the federal\r\n\r\nConstitution, that it diminishes the risk of a calamity for which\r\n\r\nno possible constitution can provide a cure. Among the\r\n\r\nadvantages of a confederate republic enumerated by Montesquieu,\r\n\r\nan important one is, \"that should a popular insurrection happen\r\n\r\nin one of the States, the others are able to quell it. Should\r\n\r\nabuses creep into one part, they are reformed by those that\r\n\r\nremain sound. \"7. \"To consider all debts contracted, and\r\n\r\nengagements entered into, before the adoption of this\r\n\r\nConstitution, as being no less valid against the United States,\r\n\r\nunder this Constitution, than under the Confederation. \"This\r\n\r\ncan only be considered as a declaratory proposition; and may have\r\n\r\nbeen inserted, among other reasons, for the satisfaction of the\r\n\r\nforeign creditors of the United States, who cannot be strangers\r\n\r\nto the pretended doctrine, that a change in the political form of\r\n\r\ncivil society has the magical effect of dissolving its moral\r\n\r\nobligations. Among the lesser criticisms which have been\r\n\r\nexercised on the Constitution, it has been remarked that the\r\n\r\nvalidity of engagements ought to have been asserted in favor of\r\n\r\nthe United States, as well as against them; and in the spirit\r\n\r\nwhich usually characterizes little critics, the omission has been\r\n\r\ntransformed and magnified into a plot against the national\r\n\r\nrights. The authors of this discovery may be told, what few\r\n\r\nothers need to be informed of, that as engagements are in their\r\n\r\nnature reciprocal, an assertion of their validity on one side,\r\n\r\nnecessarily involves a validity on the other side; and that as\r\n\r\nthe article is merely declaratory, the establishment of the\r\n\r\nprinciple in one case is sufficient for every case. They may be\r\n\r\nfurther told, that every constitution must limit its precautions\r\n\r\nto dangers that are not altogether imaginary; and that no real\r\n\r\ndanger can exist that the government would DARE, with, or even\r\n\r\nwithout, this constitutional declaration before it, to remit the\r\n\r\ndebts justly due to the public, on the pretext here condemned. 8.\r\n\r\n\"To provide for amendments to be ratified by three fourths of\r\n\r\nthe States under two exceptions only. \"That useful alterations\r\n\r\nwill be suggested by experience, could not but be foreseen. It\r\n\r\nwas requisite, therefore, that a mode for introducing them should\r\n\r\nbe provided. The mode preferred by the convention seems to be\r\n\r\nstamped with every mark of propriety. It guards equally against\r\n\r\nthat extreme facility, which would render the Constitution too\r\n\r\nmutable; and that extreme difficulty, which might perpetuate its\r\n\r\ndiscovered faults. It, moreover, equally enables the general and\r\n\r\nthe State governments to originate the amendment of errors, as\r\n\r\nthey may be pointed out by the experience on one side, or on the\r\n\r\nother. The exception in favor of the equality of suffrage in the\r\n\r\nSenate, was probably meant as a palladium to the residuary\r\n\r\nsovereignty of the States, implied and secured by that principle\r\n\r\nof representation in one branch of the legislature; and was\r\n\r\nprobably insisted on by the States particularly attached to that\r\n\r\nequality. The other exception must have been admitted on the same\r\n\r\nconsiderations which produced the privilege defended by it. 9.\r\n\r\n\"The ratification of the conventions of nine States shall be\r\n\r\nsufficient for the establishment of this Constitution between the\r\n\r\nStates, ratifying the same. \"This article speaks for itself.\r\n\r\nThe express authority of the people alone could give due validity\r\n\r\nto the Constitution. To have required the unanimous ratification\r\n\r\nof the thirteen States, would have subjected the essential\r\n\r\ninterests of the whole to the caprice or corruption of a single\r\n\r\nmember. It would have marked a want of foresight in the\r\n\r\nconvention, which our own experience would have rendered\r\n\r\ninexcusable. Two questions of a very delicate nature present\r\n\r\nthemselves on this occasion: 1. On what principle the\r\n\r\nConfederation, which stands in the solemn form of a compact among\r\n\r\nthe States, can be superseded without the unanimous consent of\r\n\r\nthe parties to it? 2. What relation is to subsist between the\r\n\r\nnine or more States ratifying the Constitution, and the remaining\r\n\r\nfew who do not become parties to it? The first question is\r\n\r\nanswered at once by recurring to the absolute necessity of the\r\n\r\ncase; to the great principle of self-preservation; to the\r\n\r\ntranscendent law of nature and of nature's God, which declares\r\n\r\nthat the safety and happiness of society are the objects at which\r\n\r\nall political institutions aim, and to which all such\r\n\r\ninstitutions must be sacrificed. PERHAPS, also, an answer may be\r\n\r\nfound without searching beyond the principles of the compact\r\n\r\nitself. It has been heretofore noted among the defects of the\r\n\r\nConfederation, that in many of the States it had received no\r\n\r\nhigher sanction than a mere legislative ratification. The\r\n\r\nprinciple of reciprocality seems to require that its obligation\r\n\r\non the other States should be reduced to the same standard. A\r\n\r\ncompact between independent sovereigns, founded on ordinary acts\r\n\r\nof legislative authority, can pretend to no higher validity than\r\n\r\na league or treaty between the parties. It is an established\r\n\r\ndoctrine on the subject of treaties, that all the articles are\r\n\r\nmutually conditions of each other; that a breach of any one\r\n\r\narticle is a breach of the whole treaty; and that a breach,\r\n\r\ncommitted by either of the parties, absolves the others, and\r\n\r\nauthorizes them, if they please, to pronounce the compact\r\n\r\nviolated and void. Should it unhappily be necessary to appeal to\r\n\r\nthese delicate truths for a justification for dispensing with\r\n\r\nthe consent of particular States to a dissolution of the federal\r\n\r\npact, will not the complaining parties find it a difficult task\r\n\r\nto answer the MULTIPLIED and IMPORTANT infractions with which\r\n\r\nthey may be confronted? The time has been when it was incumbent\r\n\r\non us all to veil the ideas which this paragraph exhibits. The\r\n\r\nscene is now changed, and with it the part which the same motives\r\n\r\ndictate. The second question is not less delicate; and the\r\n\r\nflattering prospect of its being merely hypothetical forbids an\r\n\r\novercurious discussion of it. It is one of those cases which must\r\n\r\nbe left to provide for itself. In general, it may be observed,\r\n\r\nthat although no political relation can subsist between the\r\n\r\nassenting and dissenting States, yet the moral relations will\r\n\r\nremain uncancelled. The claims of justice, both on one side and\r\n\r\non the other, will be in force, and must be fulfilled; the\r\n\r\nrights of humanity must in all cases be duly and mutually\r\n\r\nrespected; whilst considerations of a common interest, and,\r\n\r\nabove all, the remembrance of the endearing scenes which are\r\n\r\npast, and the anticipation of a speedy triumph over the obstacles\r\n\r\nto reunion, will, it is hoped, not urge in vain MODERATION on one\r\n\r\nside, and PRUDENCE on the other. PUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 44\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRestrictions on the Authority of the Several States\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Friday, January 25, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADISON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nA FIFTH class of provisions in favor of the federal authority\r\n\r\nconsists of the following restrictions on the authority of the\r\n\r\nseveral States:1. \"No State shall enter into any treaty,\r\n\r\nalliance, or confederation; grant letters of marque and reprisal;\r\n\r\ncoin money; emit bills of credit; make any thing but gold and\r\n\r\nsilver a legal tender in payment of debts; pass any bill of\r\n\r\nattainder, ex-post-facto law, or law impairing the obligation of\r\n\r\ncontracts; or grant any title of nobility. \"The prohibition\r\n\r\nagainst treaties, alliances, and confederations makes a part of\r\n\r\nthe existing articles of Union; and for reasons which need no\r\n\r\nexplanation, is copied into the new Constitution. The prohibition\r\n\r\nof letters of marque is another part of the old system, but is\r\n\r\nsomewhat extended in the new. According to the former, letters of\r\n\r\nmarque could be granted by the States after a declaration of war;\r\n\r\naccording to the latter, these licenses must be obtained, as well\r\n\r\nduring war as previous to its declaration, from the government of\r\n\r\nthe United States. This alteration is fully justified by the\r\n\r\nadvantage of uniformity in all points which relate to foreign\r\n\r\npowers; and of immediate responsibility to the nation in all\r\n\r\nthose for whose conduct the nation itself is to be responsible.\r\n\r\nThe right of coining money, which is here taken from the States,\r\n\r\nwas left in their hands by the Confederation, as a concurrent\r\n\r\nright with that of Congress, under an exception in favor of the\r\n\r\nexclusive right of Congress to regulate the alloy and value. In\r\n\r\nthis instance, also, the new provision is an improvement on the\r\n\r\nold. Whilst the alloy and value depended on the general\r\n\r\nauthority, a right of coinage in the particular States could have\r\n\r\nno other effect than to multiply expensive mints and diversify\r\n\r\nthe forms and weights of the circulating pieces. The latter\r\n\r\ninconveniency defeats one purpose for which the power was\r\n\r\noriginally submitted to the federal head; and as far as the\r\n\r\nformer might prevent an inconvenient remittance of gold and\r\n\r\nsilver to the central mint for recoinage, the end can be as well\r\n\r\nattained by local mints established under the general authority.\r\n\r\nThe extension of the prohibition to bills of credit must give\r\n\r\npleasure to every citizen, in proportion to his love of justice\r\n\r\nand his knowledge of the true springs of public prosperity. The\r\n\r\nloss which America has sustained since the peace, from the\r\n\r\npestilent effects of paper money on the necessary confidence\r\n\r\nbetween man and man, on the necessary confidence in the public\r\n\r\ncouncils, on the industry and morals of the people, and on the\r\n\r\ncharacter of republican government, constitutes an enormous debt\r\n\r\nagainst the States chargeable with this unadvised measure, which\r\n\r\nmust long remain unsatisfied; or rather an accumulation of guilt,\r\n\r\nwhich can be expiated no otherwise than by a voluntary sacrifice\r\n\r\non the altar of justice, of the power which has been the\r\n\r\ninstrument of it. In addition to these persuasive\r\n\r\nconsiderations, it may be observed, that the same reasons which\r\n\r\nshow the necessity of denying to the States the power of\r\n\r\nregulating coin, prove with equal force that they ought not to be\r\n\r\nat liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin. Had\r\n\r\nevery State a right to regulate the value of its coin, there\r\n\r\nmight be as many different currencies as States, and thus the\r\n\r\nintercourse among them would be impeded; retrospective\r\n\r\nalterations in its value might be made, and thus the citizens of\r\n\r\nother States be injured, and animosities be kindled among the\r\n\r\nStates themselves. The subjects of foreign powers might suffer\r\n\r\nfrom the same cause, and hence the Union be discredited and\r\n\r\nembroiled by the indiscretion of a single member. No one of these\r\n\r\nmischiefs is less incident to a power in the States to emit paper\r\n\r\nmoney, than to coin gold or silver. The power to make any thing\r\n\r\nbut gold and silver a tender in payment of debts, is withdrawn\r\n\r\nfrom the States, on the same principle with that of issuing a\r\n\r\npaper currency. Bills of attainder, ex-post-facto laws, and laws\r\n\r\nimpairing the obligation of contracts, are contrary to the first\r\n\r\nprinciples of the social compact, and to every principle of sound\r\n\r\nlegislation. The two former are expressly prohibited by the\r\n\r\ndeclarations prefixed to some of the State constitutions, and all\r\n\r\nof them are prohibited by the spirit and scope of these\r\n\r\nfundamental charters. Our own experience has taught us,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, that additional fences against these dangers ought\r\n\r\nnot to be omitted. Very properly, therefore, have the convention\r\n\r\nadded this constitutional bulwark in favor of personal security\r\n\r\nand private rights; and I am much deceived if they have not, in\r\n\r\nso doing, as faithfully consulted the genuine sentiments as the\r\n\r\nundoubted interests of their constituents. The sober people of\r\n\r\nAmerica are weary of the fluctuating policy which has directed\r\n\r\nthe public councils. They have seen with regret and indignation\r\n\r\nthat sudden changes and legislative interferences, in cases\r\n\r\naffecting personal rights, become jobs in the hands of\r\n\r\nenterprising and influential speculators, and snares to the\r\n\r\nmore-industrious and less-informed part of the community. They\r\n\r\nhave seen, too, that one legislative interference is but the\r\n\r\nfirst link of a long chain of repetitions, every subsequent\r\n\r\ninterference being naturally produced by the effects of the\r\n\r\npreceding. They very rightly infer, therefore, that some thorough\r\n\r\nreform is wanting, which will banish speculations on public\r\n\r\nmeasures, inspire a general prudence and industry, and give a\r\n\r\nregular course to the business of society. The prohibition with\r\n\r\nrespect to titles of nobility is copied from the articles of\r\n\r\nConfederation and needs no comment. 2. \"No State shall, without\r\n\r\nthe consent of the Congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports\r\n\r\nor exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing\r\n\r\nits inspection laws, and the net produce of all duties and\r\n\r\nimposts laid by any State on imports or exports, shall be for the\r\n\r\nuse of the treasury of the United States; and all such laws shall\r\n\r\nbe subject to the revision and control of the Congress. No State\r\n\r\nshall, without the consent of Congress, lay any duty on tonnage,\r\n\r\nkeep troops or ships of war in time of peace, enter into any\r\n\r\nagreement or compact with another State, or with a foreign power,\r\n\r\nor engage in war unless actually invaded, or in such imminent\r\n\r\ndanger as will not admit of delay. \"The restraint on the power\r\n\r\nof the States over imports and exports is enforced by all the\r\n\r\narguments which prove the necessity of submitting the regulation\r\n\r\nof trade to the federal councils. It is needless, therefore, to\r\n\r\nremark further on this head, than that the manner in which the\r\n\r\nrestraint is qualified seems well calculated at once to secure to\r\n\r\nthe States a reasonable discretion in providing for the\r\n\r\nconveniency of their imports and exports, and to the United\r\n\r\nStates a reasonable check against the abuse of this discretion.\r\n\r\nThe remaining particulars of this clause fall within reasonings\r\n\r\nwhich are either so obvious, or have been so fully developed,\r\n\r\nthat they may be passed over without remark. The SIXTH and last\r\n\r\nclass consists of the several powers and provisions by which\r\n\r\nefficacy is given to all the rest. 1. Of these the first is, the\r\n\r\n\"power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for\r\n\r\ncarrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other\r\n\r\npowers vested by this Constitution in the government of the\r\n\r\nUnited States, or in any department or officer thereof. \"Few\r\n\r\nparts of the Constitution have been assailed with more\r\n\r\nintemperance than this; yet on a fair investigation of it, no\r\n\r\npart can appear more completely invulnerable. Without the\r\n\r\nSUBSTANCE of this power, the whole Constitution would be a dead\r\n\r\nletter. Those who object to the article, therefore, as a part of\r\n\r\nthe Constitution, can only mean that the FORM of the provision is\r\n\r\nimproper. But have they considered whether a better form could\r\n\r\nhave been substituted? There are four other possible methods\r\n\r\nwhich the Constitution might have taken on this subject. They\r\n\r\nmight have copied the second article of the existing\r\n\r\nConfederation, which would have prohibited the exercise of any\r\n\r\npower not EXPRESSLY delegated; they might have attempted a\r\n\r\npositive enumeration of the powers comprehended under the general\r\n\r\nterms \"necessary and proper\"; they might have attempted a\r\n\r\nnegative enumeration of them, by specifying the powers excepted\r\n\r\nfrom the general definition; they might have been altogether\r\n\r\nsilent on the subject, leaving these necessary and proper powers\r\n\r\nto construction and inference. Had the convention taken the\r\n\r\nfirst method of adopting the second article of Confederation, it\r\n\r\nis evident that the new Congress would be continually exposed, as\r\n\r\ntheir predecessors have been, to the alternative of construing\r\n\r\nthe term \"EXPRESSLY\" with so much rigor, as to disarm the\r\n\r\ngovernment of all real authority whatever, or with so much\r\n\r\nlatitude as to destroy altogether the force of the restriction.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to show, if it were necessary, that no important\r\n\r\npower, delegated by the articles of Confederation, has been or\r\n\r\ncan be executed by Congress, without recurring more or less to\r\n\r\nthe doctrine of CONSTRUCTION or IMPLICATION. As the powers\r\n\r\ndelegated under the new system are more extensive, the government\r\n\r\nwhich is to administer it would find itself still more distressed\r\n\r\nwith the alternative of betraying the public interests by doing\r\n\r\nnothing, or of violating the Constitution by exercising powers\r\n\r\nindispensably necessary and proper, but, at the same time, not\r\n\r\nEXPRESSLY granted. Had the convention attempted a positive\r\n\r\nenumeration of the powers necessary and proper for carrying their\r\n\r\nother powers into effect, the attempt would have involved a\r\n\r\ncomplete digest of laws on every subject to which the\r\n\r\nConstitution relates; accommodated too, not only to the existing\r\n\r\nstate of things, but to all the possible changes which futurity\r\n\r\nmay produce; for in every new application of a general power, the\r\n\r\nPARTICULAR POWERS, which are the means of attaining the OBJECT of\r\n\r\nthe general power, must always necessarily vary with that object,\r\n\r\nand be often properly varied whilst the object remains the same.\r\n\r\nHad they attempted to enumerate the particular powers or means\r\n\r\nnot necessary or proper for carrying the general powers into\r\n\r\nexecution, the task would have been no less chimerical; and would\r\n\r\nhave been liable to this further objection, that every defect in\r\n\r\nthe enumeration would have been equivalent to a positive grant of\r\n\r\nauthority. If, to avoid this consequence, they had attempted a\r\n\r\npartial enumeration of the exceptions, and described the residue\r\n\r\nby the general terms, NOT NECESSARY OR PROPER, it must have\r\n\r\nhappened that the enumeration would comprehend a few of the\r\n\r\nexcepted powers only; that these would be such as would be least\r\n\r\nlikely to be assumed or tolerated, because the enumeration would\r\n\r\nof course select such as would be least necessary or proper; and\r\n\r\nthat the unnecessary and improper powers included in the\r\n\r\nresiduum, would be less forcibly excepted, than if no partial\r\n\r\nenumeration had been made. Had the Constitution been silent on\r\n\r\nthis head, there can be no doubt that all the particular powers\r\n\r\nrequisite as means of executing the general powers would have\r\n\r\nresulted to the government, by unavoidable implication. No axiom\r\n\r\nis more clearly established in law, or in reason, than that\r\n\r\nwherever the end is required, the means are authorized; wherever\r\n\r\na general power to do a thing is given, every particular power\r\n\r\nnecessary for doing it is included. Had this last method,\r\n\r\ntherefore, been pursued by the convention, every objection now\r\n\r\nurged against their plan would remain in all its plausibility;\r\n\r\nand the real inconveniency would be incurred of not removing a\r\n\r\npretext which may be seized on critical occasions for drawing\r\n\r\ninto question the essential powers of the Union. If it be asked\r\n\r\nwhat is to be the consequence, in case the Congress shall\r\n\r\nmisconstrue this part of the Constitution, and exercise powers\r\n\r\nnot warranted by its true meaning, I answer, the same as if they\r\n\r\nshould misconstrue or enlarge any other power vested in them; as\r\n\r\nif the general power had been reduced to particulars, and any one\r\n\r\nof these were to be violated; the same, in short, as if the State\r\n\r\nlegislatures should violate the irrespective constitutional\r\n\r\nauthorities. In the first instance, the success of the usurpation\r\n\r\nwill depend on the executive and judiciary departments, which are\r\n\r\nto expound and give effect to the legislative acts; and in the\r\n\r\nlast resort a remedy must be obtained from the people who can, by\r\n\r\nthe election of more faithful representatives, annul the acts of\r\n\r\nthe usurpers. The truth is, that this ultimate redress may be\r\n\r\nmore confided in against unconstitutional acts of the federal\r\n\r\nthan of the State legislatures, for this plain reason, that as\r\n\r\nevery such act of the former will be an invasion of the rights of\r\n\r\nthe latter, these will be ever ready to mark the innovation, to\r\n\r\nsound the alarm to the people, and to exert their local influence\r\n\r\nin effecting a change of federal representatives. There being no\r\n\r\nsuch intermediate body between the State legislatures and the\r\n\r\npeople interested in watching the conduct of the former,\r\n\r\nviolations of the State constitutions are more likely to remain\r\n\r\nunnoticed and unredressed. 2. \"This Constitution and the laws\r\n\r\nof the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof,\r\n\r\nand all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the\r\n\r\nauthority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the\r\n\r\nland, and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any\r\n\r\nthing in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding. \"The indiscreet zeal of the adversaries to the\r\n\r\nConstitution has betrayed them into an attack on this part of it\r\n\r\nalso, without which it would have been evidently and radically\r\n\r\ndefective. To be fully sensible of this, we need only suppose for\r\n\r\na moment that the supremacy of the State constitutions had been\r\n\r\nleft complete by a saving clause in their favor. In the first\r\n\r\nplace, as these constitutions invest the State legislatures with\r\n\r\nabsolute sovereignty, in all cases not excepted by the existing\r\n\r\narticles of Confederation, all the authorities contained in the\r\n\r\nproposed Constitution, so far as they exceed those enumerated in\r\n\r\nthe Confederation, would have been annulled, and the new Congress\r\n\r\nwould have been reduced to the same impotent condition with their\r\n\r\npredecessors. In the next place, as the constitutions of some of\r\n\r\nthe States do not even expressly and fully recognize the existing\r\n\r\npowers of the Confederacy, an express saving of the supremacy of\r\n\r\nthe former would, in such States, have brought into question\r\n\r\nevery power contained in the proposed Constitution. In the third\r\n\r\nplace, as the constitutions of the States differ much from each\r\n\r\nother, it might happen that a treaty or national law, of great\r\n\r\nand equal importance to the States, would interfere with some and\r\n\r\nnot with other constitutions, and would consequently be valid in\r\n\r\nsome of the States, at the same time that it would have no effect\r\n\r\nin others. In fine, the world would have seen, for the first\r\n\r\ntime, a system of government founded on an inversion of the\r\n\r\nfundamental principles of all government; it would have seen the\r\n\r\nauthority of the whole society every where subordinate to the\r\n\r\nauthority of the parts; it would have seen a monster, in which\r\n\r\nthe head was under the direction of the members. 3. \"The\r\n\r\nSenators and Representatives, and the members of the several\r\n\r\nState legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both\r\n\r\nof the United States and the several States, shall be bound by\r\n\r\noath or affirmation to support this Constitution. \"It has been\r\n\r\nasked why it was thought necessary, that the State magistracy\r\n\r\nshould be bound to support the federal Constitution, and\r\n\r\nunnecessary that a like oath should be imposed on the officers of\r\n\r\nthe United States, in favor of the State constitutions. Several\r\n\r\nreasons might be assigned for the distinction. I content myself\r\n\r\nwith one, which is obvious and conclusive. The members of the\r\n\r\nfederal government will have no agency in carrying the State\r\n\r\nconstitutions into effect. The members and officers of the State\r\n\r\ngovernments, on the contrary, will have an essential agency in\r\n\r\ngiving effect to the federal Constitution. The election of the\r\n\r\nPresident and Senate will depend, in all cases, on the\r\n\r\nlegislatures of the several States. And the election of the House\r\n\r\nof Representatives will equally depend on the same authority in\r\n\r\nthe first instance; and will, probably, forever be conducted by\r\n\r\nthe officers, and according to the laws, of the States. 4. Among\r\n\r\nthe provisions for giving efficacy to the federal powers might be\r\n\r\nadded those which belong to the executive and judiciary\r\n\r\ndepartments: but as these are reserved for particular examination\r\n\r\nin another place, I pass them over in this. We have now\r\n\r\nreviewed, in detail, all the articles composing the sum or\r\n\r\nquantity of power delegated by the proposed Constitution to the\r\n\r\nfederal government, and are brought to this undeniable\r\n\r\nconclusion, that no part of the power is unnecessary or improper\r\n\r\nfor accomplishing the necessary objects of the Union. The\r\n\r\nquestion, therefore, whether this amount of power shall be\r\n\r\ngranted or not, resolves itself into another question, whether or\r\n\r\nnot a government commensurate to the exigencies of the Union\r\n\r\nshall be established; or, in other words, whether the Union\r\n\r\nitself shall be preserved. PUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 45\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Alleged Danger From the Powers of the Union to the State\r\n\r\nGovernments Considered\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Fournal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADISON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nHAVING shown that no one of the powers transferred to the federal\r\n\r\ngovernment is unnecessary or improper, the next question to be\r\n\r\nconsidered is, whether the whole mass of them will be dangerous\r\n\r\nto the portion of authority left in the several States. The\r\n\r\nadversaries to the plan of the convention, instead of considering\r\n\r\nin the first place what degree of power was absolutely necessary\r\n\r\nfor the purposes of the federal government, have exhausted\r\n\r\nthemselves in a secondary inquiry into the possible consequences\r\n\r\nof the proposed degree of power to the governments of the\r\n\r\nparticular States. But if the Union, as has been shown, be\r\n\r\nessential to the security of the people of America against\r\n\r\nforeign danger; if it be essential to their security against\r\n\r\ncontentions and wars among the different States; if it be\r\n\r\nessential to guard them against those violent and oppressive\r\n\r\nfactions which embitter the blessings of liberty, and against\r\n\r\nthose military establishments which must gradually poison its\r\n\r\nvery fountain; if, in a word, the Union be essential to the\r\n\r\nhappiness of the people of America, is it not preposterous, to\r\n\r\nurge as an objection to a government, without which the objects\r\n\r\nof the Union cannot be attained, that such a government may\r\n\r\nderogate from the importance of the governments of the individual\r\n\r\nStates? Was, then, the American Revolution effected, was the\r\n\r\nAmerican Confederacy formed, was the precious blood of thousands\r\n\r\nspilt, and the hard-earned substance of millions lavished, not\r\n\r\nthat the people of America should enjoy peace, liberty, and\r\n\r\nsafety, but that the government of the individual States, that\r\n\r\nparticular municipal establishments, might enjoy a certain extent\r\n\r\nof power, and be arrayed with certain dignities and attributes of\r\n\r\nsovereignty? We have heard of the impious doctrine in the Old\r\n\r\nWorld, that the people were made for kings, not kings for the\r\n\r\npeople. Is the same doctrine to be revived in the New, in another\r\n\r\nshape that the solid happiness of the people is to be sacrificed\r\n\r\nto the views of political institutions of a different form? It is\r\n\r\ntoo early for politicians to presume on our forgetting that the\r\n\r\npublic good, the real welfare of the great body of the people, is\r\n\r\nthe supreme object to be pursued; and that no form of government\r\n\r\nwhatever has any other value than as it may be fitted for the\r\n\r\nattainment of this object. Were the plan of the convention\r\n\r\nadverse to the public happiness, my voice would be, Reject the\r\n\r\nplan. Were the Union itself inconsistent with the public\r\n\r\nhappiness, it would be, Abolish the Union. In like manner, as far\r\n\r\nas the sovereignty of the States cannot be reconciled to the\r\n\r\nhappiness of the people, the voice of every good citizen must be,\r\n\r\nLet the former be sacrificed to the latter. How far the sacrifice\r\n\r\nis necessary, has been shown. How far the unsacrificed residue\r\n\r\nwill be endangered, is the question before us. Several important\r\n\r\nconsiderations have been touched in the course of these papers,\r\n\r\nwhich discountenance the supposition that the operation of the\r\n\r\nfederal government will by degrees prove fatal to the State\r\n\r\ngovernments. The more I revolve the subject, the more fully I am\r\n\r\npersuaded that the balance is much more likely to be disturbed by\r\n\r\nthe preponderancy of the last than of the first scale. We have\r\n\r\nseen, in all the examples of ancient and modern confederacies,\r\n\r\nthe strongest tendency continually betraying itself in the\r\n\r\nmembers, to despoil the general government of its authorities,\r\n\r\nwith a very ineffectual capacity in the latter to defend itself\r\n\r\nagainst the encroachments. Although, in most of these examples,\r\n\r\nthe system has been so dissimilar from that under consideration\r\n\r\nas greatly to weaken any inference concerning the latter from the\r\n\r\nfate of the former, yet, as the States will retain, under the\r\n\r\nproposed Constitution, a very extensive portion of active\r\n\r\nsovereignty, the inference ought not to be wholly disregarded. In\r\n\r\nthe Achaean league it is probable that the federal head had a\r\n\r\ndegree and species of power, which gave it a considerable\r\n\r\nlikeness to the government framed by the convention. The Lycian\r\n\r\nConfederacy, as far as its principles and form are transmitted,\r\n\r\nmust have borne a still greater analogy to it. Yet history does\r\n\r\nnot inform us that either of them ever degenerated, or tended to\r\n\r\ndegenerate, into one consolidated government. On the contrary, we\r\n\r\nknow that the ruin of one of them proceeded from the incapacity\r\n\r\nof the federal authority to prevent the dissensions, and finally\r\n\r\nthe disunion, of the subordinate authorities. These cases are the\r\n\r\nmore worthy of our attention, as the external causes by which the\r\n\r\ncomponent parts were pressed together were much more numerous and\r\n\r\npowerful than in our case; and consequently less powerful\r\n\r\nligaments within would be sufficient to bind the members to the\r\n\r\nhead, and to each other. In the feudal system, we have seen a\r\n\r\nsimilar propensity exemplified. Notwithstanding the want of\r\n\r\nproper sympathy in every instance between the local sovereigns\r\n\r\nand the people, and the sympathy in some instances between the\r\n\r\ngeneral sovereign and the latter, it usually happened that the\r\n\r\nlocal sovereigns prevailed in the rivalship for encroachments.\r\n\r\nHad no external dangers enforced internal harmony and\r\n\r\nsubordination, and particularly, had the local sovereigns\r\n\r\npossessed the affections of the people, the great kingdoms in\r\n\r\nEurope would at this time consist of as many independent princes\r\n\r\nas there were formerly feudatory barons. The State government\r\n\r\nwill have the advantage of the Federal government, whether we\r\n\r\ncompare them in respect to the immediate dependence of the one on\r\n\r\nthe other; to the weight of personal influence which each side\r\n\r\nwill possess; to the powers respectively vested in them; to the\r\n\r\npredilection and probable support of the people; to the\r\n\r\ndisposition and faculty of resisting and frustrating the measures\r\n\r\nof each other. The State governments may be regarded as\r\n\r\nconstituent and essential parts of the federal government; whilst\r\n\r\nthe latter is nowise essential to the operation or organization\r\n\r\nof the former. Without the intervention of the State\r\n\r\nlegislatures, the President of the United States cannot be\r\n\r\nelected at all. They must in all cases have a great share in his\r\n\r\nappointment, and will, perhaps, in most cases, of themselves\r\n\r\ndetermine it. The Senate will be elected absolutely and\r\n\r\nexclusively by the State legislatures. Even the House of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives, though drawn immediately from the people, will\r\n\r\nbe chosen very much under the influence of that class of men,\r\n\r\nwhose influence over the people obtains for themselves an\r\n\r\nelection into the State legislatures. Thus, each of the principal\r\n\r\nbranches of the federal government will owe its existence more or\r\n\r\nless to the favor of the State governments, and must consequently\r\n\r\nfeel a dependence, which is much more likely to beget a\r\n\r\ndisposition too obsequious than too overbearing towards them. On\r\n\r\nthe other side, the component parts of the State governments will\r\n\r\nin no instance be indebted for their appointment to the direct\r\n\r\nagency of the federal government, and very little, if at all, to\r\n\r\nthe local influence of its members. The number of individuals\r\n\r\nemployed under the Constitution of the United States will be much\r\n\r\nsmaller than the number employed under the particular States.\r\n\r\nThere will consequently be less of personal influence on the side\r\n\r\nof the former than of the latter. The members of the legislative,\r\n\r\nexecutive, and judiciary departments of thirteen and more States,\r\n\r\nthe justices of peace, officers of militia, ministerial officers\r\n\r\nof justice, with all the county, corporation, and town officers,\r\n\r\nfor three millions and more of people, intermixed, and having\r\n\r\nparticular acquaintance with every class and circle of people,\r\n\r\nmust exceed, beyond all proportion, both in number and influence,\r\n\r\nthose of every description who will be employed in the\r\n\r\nadministration of the federal system. Compare the members of the\r\n\r\nthree great departments of the thirteen States, excluding from\r\n\r\nthe judiciary department the justices of peace, with the members\r\n\r\nof the corresponding departments of the single government of the\r\n\r\nUnion; compare the militia officers of three millions of people\r\n\r\nwith the military and marine officers of any establishment which\r\n\r\nis within the compass of probability, or, I may add, of\r\n\r\npossibility, and in this view alone, we may pronounce the\r\n\r\nadvantage of the States to be decisive. If the federal government\r\n\r\nis to have collectors of revenue, the State governments will have\r\n\r\ntheirs also. And as those of the former will be principally on\r\n\r\nthe seacoast, and not very numerous, whilst those of the latter\r\n\r\nwill be spread over the face of the country, and will be very\r\n\r\nnumerous, the advantage in this view also lies on the same side.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that the Confederacy is to possess, and may exercise,\r\n\r\nthe power of collecting internal as well as external taxes\r\n\r\nthroughout the States; but it is probable that this power will\r\n\r\nnot be resorted to, except for supplemental purposes of revenue;\r\n\r\nthat an option will then be given to the States to supply their\r\n\r\nquotas by previous collections of their own; and that the\r\n\r\neventual collection, under the immediate authority of the Union,\r\n\r\nwill generally be made by the officers, and according to the\r\n\r\nrules, appointed by the several States. Indeed it is extremely\r\n\r\nprobable, that in other instances, particularly in the\r\n\r\norganization of the judicial power, the officers of the States\r\n\r\nwill be clothed with the correspondent authority of the Union.\r\n\r\nShould it happen, however, that separate collectors of internal\r\n\r\nrevenue should be appointed under the federal government, the\r\n\r\ninfluence of the whole number would not bear a comparison with\r\n\r\nthat of the multitude of State officers in the opposite scale.\r\n\r\nWithin every district to which a federal collector would be\r\n\r\nallotted, there would not be less than thirty or forty, or even\r\n\r\nmore, officers of different descriptions, and many of them\r\n\r\npersons of character and weight, whose influence would lie on the\r\n\r\nside of the State. The powers delegated by the proposed\r\n\r\nConstitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those\r\n\r\nwhich are to remain in the State governments are numerous and\r\n\r\nindefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external\r\n\r\nobjects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce; with\r\n\r\nwhich last the power of taxation will, for the most part, be\r\n\r\nconnected. The powers reserved to the several States will extend\r\n\r\nto all the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs,\r\n\r\nconcern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people, and\r\n\r\nthe internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the State. The\r\n\r\noperations of the federal government will be most extensive and\r\n\r\nimportant in times of war and danger; those of the State\r\n\r\ngovernments, in times of peace and security. As the former\r\n\r\nperiods will probably bear a small proportion to the latter, the\r\n\r\nState governments will here enjoy another advantage over the\r\n\r\nfederal government. The more adequate, indeed, the federal powers\r\n\r\nmay be rendered to the national defense, the less frequent will\r\n\r\nbe those scenes of danger which might favor their ascendancy over\r\n\r\nthe governments of the particular States. If the new Constitution\r\n\r\nbe examined with accuracy and candor, it will be found that the\r\n\r\nchange which it proposes consists much less in the addition of\r\n\r\nNEW POWERS to the Union, than in the invigoration of its ORIGINAL\r\n\r\nPOWERS. The regulation of commerce, it is true, is a new power;\r\n\r\nbut that seems to be an addition which few oppose, and from which\r\n\r\nno apprehensions are entertained. The powers relating to war and\r\n\r\npeace, armies and fleets, treaties and finance, with the other\r\n\r\nmore considerable powers, are all vested in the existing Congress\r\n\r\nby the articles of Confederation. The proposed change does not\r\n\r\nenlarge these powers; it only substitutes a more effectual mode\r\n\r\nof administering them. The change relating to taxation may be\r\n\r\nregarded as the most important; and yet the present Congress have\r\n\r\nas complete authority to REQUIRE of the States indefinite\r\n\r\nsupplies of money for the common defense and general welfare, as\r\n\r\nthe future Congress will have to require them of individual\r\n\r\ncitizens; and the latter will be no more bound than the States\r\n\r\nthemselves have been, to pay the quotas respectively taxed on\r\n\r\nthem. Had the States complied punctually with the articles of\r\n\r\nConfederation, or could their compliance have been enforced by as\r\n\r\npeaceable means as may be used with success towards single\r\n\r\npersons, our past experience is very far from countenancing an\r\n\r\nopinion, that the State governments would have lost their\r\n\r\nconstitutional powers, and have gradually undergone an entire\r\n\r\nconsolidation. To maintain that such an event would have ensued,\r\n\r\nwould be to say at once, that the existence of the State\r\n\r\ngovernments is incompatible with any system whatever that\r\n\r\naccomplishes the essential purposes of the Union. PUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 46\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Influence of the State and Federal Governments Compared\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, January 29, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADISON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nRESUMING the subject of the last paper, I proceed to inquire\r\n\r\nwhether the federal government or the State governments will have\r\n\r\nthe advantage with regard to the predilection and support of the\r\n\r\npeople. Notwithstanding the different modes in which they are\r\n\r\nappointed, we must consider both of them as substantially\r\n\r\ndependent on the great body of the citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nI assume this position here as it respects the first, reserving\r\n\r\nthe proofs for another place. The federal and State governments\r\n\r\nare in fact but different agents and trustees of the people,\r\n\r\nconstituted with different powers, and designed for different\r\n\r\npurposes. The adversaries of the Constitution seem to have lost\r\n\r\nsight of the people altogether in their reasonings on this\r\n\r\nsubject; and to have viewed these different establishments, not\r\n\r\nonly as mutual rivals and enemies, but as uncontrolled by any\r\n\r\ncommon superior in their efforts to usurp the authorities of each\r\n\r\nother. These gentlemen must here be reminded of their error. They\r\n\r\nmust be told that the ultimate authority, wherever the derivative\r\n\r\nmay be found, resides in the people alone, and that it will not\r\n\r\ndepend merely on the comparative ambition or address of the\r\n\r\ndifferent governments, whether either, or which of them, will be\r\n\r\nable to enlarge its sphere of jurisdiction at the expense of the\r\n\r\nother. Truth, no less than decency, requires that the event in\r\n\r\nevery case should be supposed to depend on the sentiments and\r\n\r\nsanction of their common constituents. Many considerations,\r\n\r\nbesides those suggested on a former occasion, seem to place it\r\n\r\nbeyond doubt that the first and most natural attachment of the\r\n\r\npeople will be to the governments of their respective States.\r\n\r\nInto the administration of these a greater number of individuals\r\n\r\nwill expect to rise. From the gift of these a greater number of\r\n\r\noffices and emoluments will flow. By the superintending care of\r\n\r\nthese, all the more domestic and personal interests of the people\r\n\r\nwill be regulated and provided for. With the affairs of these,\r\n\r\nthe people will be more familiarly and minutely conversant. And\r\n\r\nwith the members of these, will a greater proportion of the\r\n\r\npeople have the ties of personal acquaintance and friendship, and\r\n\r\nof family and party attachments; on the side of these,\r\n\r\ntherefore, the popular bias may well be expected most strongly to\r\n\r\nincline. Experience speaks the same language in this case. The\r\n\r\nfederal administration, though hitherto very defective in\r\n\r\ncomparison with what may be hoped under a better system, had,\r\n\r\nduring the war, and particularly whilst the independent fund of\r\n\r\npaper emissions was in credit, an activity and importance as\r\n\r\ngreat as it can well have in any future circumstances whatever.\r\n\r\nIt was engaged, too, in a course of measures which had for their\r\n\r\nobject the protection of everything that was dear, and the\r\n\r\nacquisition of everything that could be desirable to the people\r\n\r\nat large. It was, nevertheless, invariably found, after the\r\n\r\ntransient enthusiasm for the early Congresses was over, that the\r\n\r\nattention and attachment of the people were turned anew to their\r\n\r\nown particular governments; that the federal council was at no\r\n\r\ntime the idol of popular favor; and that opposition to proposed\r\n\r\nenlargements of its powers and importance was the side usually\r\n\r\ntaken by the men who wished to build their political consequence\r\n\r\non the prepossessions of their fellow-citizens. If, therefore,\r\n\r\nas has been elsewhere remarked, the people should in future\r\n\r\nbecome more partial to the federal than to the State governments,\r\n\r\nthe change can only result from such manifest and irresistible\r\n\r\nproofs of a better administration, as will overcome all their\r\n\r\nantecedent propensities. And in that case, the people ought not\r\n\r\nsurely to be precluded from giving most of their confidence where\r\n\r\nthey may discover it to be most due; but even in that case the\r\n\r\nState governments could have little to apprehend, because it is\r\n\r\nonly within a certain sphere that the federal power can, in the\r\n\r\nnature of things, be advantageously administered. The remaining\r\n\r\npoints on which I propose to compare the federal and State\r\n\r\ngovernments, are the disposition and the faculty they may\r\n\r\nrespectively possess, to resist and frustrate the measures of\r\n\r\neach other. It has been already proved that the members of the\r\n\r\nfederal will be more dependent on the members of the State\r\n\r\ngovernments, than the latter will be on the former. It has\r\n\r\nappeared also, that the prepossessions of the people, on whom\r\n\r\nboth will depend, will be more on the side of the State\r\n\r\ngovernments, than of the federal government. So far as the\r\n\r\ndisposition of each towards the other may be influenced by these\r\n\r\ncauses, the State governments must clearly have the advantage.\r\n\r\nBut in a distinct and very important point of view, the advantage\r\n\r\nwill lie on the same side. The prepossessions, which the members\r\n\r\nthemselves will carry into the federal government, will generally\r\n\r\nbe favorable to the States; whilst it will rarely happen, that\r\n\r\nthe members of the State governments will carry into the public\r\n\r\ncouncils a bias in favor of the general government. A local\r\n\r\nspirit will infallibly prevail much more in the members of\r\n\r\nCongress, than a national spirit will prevail in the legislatures\r\n\r\nof the particular States. Every one knows that a great proportion\r\n\r\nof the errors committed by the State legislatures proceeds from\r\n\r\nthe disposition of the members to sacrifice the comprehensive and\r\n\r\npermanent interest of the State, to the particular and separate\r\n\r\nviews of the counties or districts in which they reside. And if\r\n\r\nthey do not sufficiently enlarge their policy to embrace the\r\n\r\ncollective welfare of their particular State, how can it be\r\n\r\nimagined that they will make the aggregate prosperity of the\r\n\r\nUnion, and the dignity and respectability of its government, the\r\n\r\nobjects of their affections and consultations? For the same\r\n\r\nreason that the members of the State legislatures will be\r\n\r\nunlikely to attach themselves sufficiently to national objects,\r\n\r\nthe members of the federal legislature will be likely to attach\r\n\r\nthemselves too much to local objects. The States will be to the\r\n\r\nlatter what counties and towns are to the former. Measures will\r\n\r\ntoo often be decided according to their probable effect, not on\r\n\r\nthe national prosperity and happiness, but on the prejudices,\r\n\r\ninterests, and pursuits of the governments and people of the\r\n\r\nindividual States. What is the spirit that has in general\r\n\r\ncharacterized the proceedings of Congress? A perusal of their\r\n\r\njournals, as well as the candid acknowledgments of such as have\r\n\r\nhad a seat in that assembly, will inform us, that the members\r\n\r\nhave but too frequently displayed the character, rather of\r\n\r\npartisans of their respective States, than of impartial guardians\r\n\r\nof a common interest; that where on one occasion improper\r\n\r\nsacrifices have been made of local considerations, to the\r\n\r\naggrandizement of the federal government, the great interests of\r\n\r\nthe nation have suffered on a hundred, from an undue attention to\r\n\r\nthe local prejudices, interests, and views of the particular\r\n\r\nStates. I mean not by these reflections to insinuate, that the\r\n\r\nnew federal government will not embrace a more enlarged plan of\r\n\r\npolicy than the existing government may have pursued; much less,\r\n\r\nthat its views will be as confined as those of the State\r\n\r\nlegislatures; but only that it will partake sufficiently of the\r\n\r\nspirit of both, to be disinclined to invade the rights of the\r\n\r\nindividual States, or the preorgatives of their governments. The\r\n\r\nmotives on the part of the State governments, to augment their\r\n\r\nprerogatives by defalcations from the federal government, will be\r\n\r\noverruled by no reciprocal predispositions in the members. Were\r\n\r\nit admitted, however, that the Federal government may feel an\r\n\r\nequal disposition with the State governments to extend its power\r\n\r\nbeyond the due limits, the latter would still have the advantage\r\n\r\nin the means of defeating such encroachments. If an act of a\r\n\r\nparticular State, though unfriendly to the national government,\r\n\r\nbe generally popular in that State and should not too grossly\r\n\r\nviolate the oaths of the State officers, it is executed\r\n\r\nimmediately and, of course, by means on the spot and depending on\r\n\r\nthe State alone. The opposition of the federal government, or the\r\n\r\ninterposition of federal officers, would but inflame the zeal of\r\n\r\nall parties on the side of the State, and the evil could not be\r\n\r\nprevented or repaired, if at all, without the employment of means\r\n\r\nwhich must always be resorted to with reluctance and difficulty.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, should an unwarrantable measure of the federal\r\n\r\ngovernment be unpopular in particular States, which would seldom\r\n\r\nfail to be the case, or even a warrantable measure be so, which\r\n\r\nmay sometimes be the case, the means of opposition to it are\r\n\r\npowerful and at hand. The disquietude of the people; their\r\n\r\nrepugnance and, perhaps, refusal to co-operate with the officers\r\n\r\nof the Union; the frowns of the executive magistracy of the\r\n\r\nState; the embarrassments created by legislative devices, which\r\n\r\nwould often be added on such occasions, would oppose, in any\r\n\r\nState, difficulties not to be despised; would form, in a large\r\n\r\nState, very serious impediments; and where the sentiments of\r\n\r\nseveral adjoining States happened to be in unison, would present\r\n\r\nobstructions which the federal government would hardly be willing\r\n\r\nto encounter. But ambitious encroachments of the federal\r\n\r\ngovernment, on the authority of the State governments, would not\r\n\r\nexcite the opposition of a single State, or of a few States\r\n\r\nonly. They would be signals of general alarm. Every government\r\n\r\nwould espouse the common cause. A correspondence would be\r\n\r\nopened. Plans of resistance would be concerted. One spirit would\r\n\r\nanimate and conduct the whole. The same combinations, in short,\r\n\r\nwould result from an apprehension of the federal, as was produced\r\n\r\nby the dread of a foreign, yoke; and unless the projected\r\n\r\ninnovations should be voluntarily renounced, the same appeal to\r\n\r\na trial of force would be made in the one case as was made in the\r\n\r\nother. But what degree of madness could ever drive the federal\r\n\r\ngovernment to such an extremity. In the contest with Great\r\n\r\nBritain, one part of the empire was employed against the other.\r\n\r\nThe more numerous part invaded the rights of the less numerous\r\n\r\npart. The attempt was unjust and unwise; but it was not in\r\n\r\nspeculation absolutely chimerical. But what would be the contest\r\n\r\nin the case we are supposing? Who would be the parties? A few\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the people would be opposed to the people\r\n\r\nthemselves; or rather one set of representatives would be\r\n\r\ncontending against thirteen sets of representatives, with the\r\n\r\nwhole body of their common constituents on the side of the\r\n\r\nlatter. The only refuge left for those who prophesy the downfall\r\n\r\nof the State governments is the visionary supposition that the\r\n\r\nfederal government may previously accumulate a military force for\r\n\r\nthe projects of ambition. The reasonings contained in these\r\n\r\npapers must have been employed to little purpose indeed, if it\r\n\r\ncould be necessary now to disprove the reality of this danger.\r\n\r\nThat the people and the States should, for a sufficient period of\r\n\r\ntime, elect an uninterrupted succession of men ready to betray\r\n\r\nboth; that the traitors should, throughout this period,\r\n\r\nuniformly and systematically pursue some fixed plan for the\r\n\r\nextension of the military establishment; that the governments\r\n\r\nand the people of the States should silently and patiently behold\r\n\r\nthe gathering storm, and continue to supply the materials, until\r\n\r\nit should be prepared to burst on their own heads, must appear to\r\n\r\nevery one more like the incoherent dreams of a delirious\r\n\r\njealousy, or the misjudged exaggerations of a counterfeit zeal,\r\n\r\nthan like the sober apprehensions of genuine patriotism.\r\n\r\nExtravagant as the supposition is, let it however be made. Let a\r\n\r\nregular army, fully equal to the resources of the country, be\r\n\r\nformed; and let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal\r\n\r\ngovernment; still it would not be going too far to say, that the\r\n\r\nState governments, with the people on their side, would be able\r\n\r\nto repel the danger. The highest number to which, according to\r\n\r\nthe best computation, a standing army can be carried in any\r\n\r\ncountry, does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number\r\n\r\nof souls; or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear\r\n\r\narms. This proportion would not yield, in the United States, an\r\n\r\narmy of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men. To these\r\n\r\nwould be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of\r\n\r\ncitizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from\r\n\r\namong themselves, fighting for their common liberties, and united\r\n\r\nand conducted by governments possessing their affections and\r\n\r\nconfidence. It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus\r\n\r\ncircumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of\r\n\r\nregular troops. Those who are best acquainted with the last\r\n\r\nsuccessful resistance of this country against the British arms,\r\n\r\nwill be most inclined to deny the possibility of it. Besides the\r\n\r\nadvantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the\r\n\r\npeople of almost every other nation, the existence of\r\n\r\nsubordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by\r\n\r\nwhich the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against\r\n\r\nthe enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a\r\n\r\nsimple government of any form can admit of. Notwithstanding the\r\n\r\nmilitary establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which\r\n\r\nare carried as far as the public resources will bear, the\r\n\r\ngovernments are afraid to trust the people with arms. And it is\r\n\r\nnot certain, that with this aid alone they would not be able to\r\n\r\nshake off their yokes. But were the people to possess the\r\n\r\nadditional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves,\r\n\r\nwho could collect the national will and direct the national\r\n\r\nforce, and of officers appointed out of the militia, by these\r\n\r\ngovernments, and attached both to them and to the militia, it may\r\n\r\nbe affirmed with the greatest assurance, that the throne of every\r\n\r\ntyranny in Europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the\r\n\r\nlegions which surround it. Let us not insult the free and gallant\r\n\r\ncitizens of America with the suspicion, that they would be less\r\n\r\nable to defend the rights of which they would be in actual\r\n\r\npossession, than the debased subjects of arbitrary power would be\r\n\r\nto rescue theirs from the hands of their oppressors. Let us\r\n\r\nrather no longer insult them with the supposition that they can\r\n\r\never reduce themselves to the necessity of making the experiment,\r\n\r\nby a blind and tame submission to the long train of insidious\r\n\r\nmeasures which must precede and produce it. The argument under\r\n\r\nthe present head may be put into a very concise form, which\r\n\r\nappears altogether conclusive. Either the mode in which the\r\n\r\nfederal government is to be constructed will render it\r\n\r\nsufficiently dependent on the people, or it will not. On the\r\n\r\nfirst supposition, it will be restrained by that dependence from\r\n\r\nforming schemes obnoxious to their constituents. On the other\r\n\r\nsupposition, it will not possess the confidence of the people,\r\n\r\nand its schemes of usurpation will be easily defeated by the\r\n\r\nState governments, who will be supported by the people. On\r\n\r\nsumming up the considerations stated in this and the last paper,\r\n\r\nthey seem to amount to the most convincing evidence, that the\r\n\r\npowers proposed to be lodged in the federal government are as\r\n\r\nlittle formidable to those reserved to the individual States, as\r\n\r\nthey are indispensably necessary to accomplish the purposes of\r\n\r\nthe Union; and that all those alarms which have been sounded, of\r\n\r\na meditated and consequential annihilation of the State\r\n\r\ngovernments, must, on the most favorable interpretation, be\r\n\r\nascribed to the chimerical fears of the authors of them. PUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 47\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Particular Structure of the New Government and the\r\n\r\nDistribution of Power Among Its Different Parts\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Friday, February 1, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADISON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nHAVING reviewed the general form of the proposed government and\r\n\r\nthe general mass of power allotted to it, I proceed to examine\r\n\r\nthe particular structure of this government, and the distribution\r\n\r\nof this mass of power among its constituent parts. One of the\r\n\r\nprincipal objections inculcated by the more respectable\r\n\r\nadversaries to the Constitution, is its supposed violation of the\r\n\r\npolitical maxim, that the legislative, executive, and judiciary\r\n\r\ndepartments ought to be separate and distinct. In the structure\r\n\r\nof the federal government, no regard, it is said, seems to have\r\n\r\nbeen paid to this essential precaution in favor of liberty. The\r\n\r\nseveral departments of power are distributed and blended in such\r\n\r\na manner as at once to destroy all symmetry and beauty of form,\r\n\r\nand to expose some of the essential parts of the edifice to the\r\n\r\ndanger of being crushed by the disproportionate weight of other\r\n\r\nparts. No political truth is certainly of greater intrinsic\r\n\r\nvalue, or is stamped with the authority of more enlightened\r\n\r\npatrons of liberty, than that on which the objection is founded.\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and\r\n\r\njudiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and\r\n\r\nwhether hereditary, selfappointed, or elective, may justly be\r\n\r\npronounced the very definition of tyranny. Were the federal\r\n\r\nConstitution, therefore, really chargeable with the accumulation\r\n\r\nof power, or with a mixture of powers, having a dangerous\r\n\r\ntendency to such an accumulation, no further arguments would be\r\n\r\nnecessary to inspire a universal reprobation of the system. I\r\n\r\npersuade myself, however, that it will be made apparent to every\r\n\r\none, that the charge cannot be supported, and that the maxim on\r\n\r\nwhich it relies has been totally misconceived and misapplied. In\r\n\r\norder to form correct ideas on this important subject, it will be\r\n\r\nproper to investigate the sense in which the preservation of\r\n\r\nliberty requires that the three great departments of power should\r\n\r\nbe separate and distinct. The oracle who is always consulted and\r\n\r\ncited on this subject is the celebrated Montesquieu. If he be not\r\n\r\nthe author of this invaluable precept in the science of politics,\r\n\r\nhe has the merit at least of displaying and recommending it most\r\n\r\neffectually to the attention of mankind. Let us endeavor, in the\r\n\r\nfirst place, to ascertain his meaning on this point. The British\r\n\r\nConstitution was to Montesquieu what Homer has been to the\r\n\r\ndidactic writers on epic poetry. As the latter have considered\r\n\r\nthe work of the immortal bard as the perfect model from which the\r\n\r\nprinciples and rules of the epic art were to be drawn, and by\r\n\r\nwhich all similar works were to be judged, so this great\r\n\r\npolitical critic appears to have viewed the Constitution of\r\n\r\nEngland as the standard, or to use his own expression, as the\r\n\r\nmirror of political liberty; and to have delivered, in the form\r\n\r\nof elementary truths, the several characteristic principles of\r\n\r\nthat particular system. That we may be sure, then, not to mistake\r\n\r\nhis meaning in this case, let us recur to the source from which\r\n\r\nthe maxim was drawn.\r\n                        On the slightest view of the British\r\n\r\nConstitution, we must perceive that the legislative, executive,\r\n\r\nand judiciary departments are by no means totally separate and\r\n\r\ndistinct from each other. The executive magistrate forms an\r\n\r\nintegral part of the legislative authority. He alone has the\r\n\r\nprerogative of making treaties with foreign sovereigns, which,\r\n\r\nwhen made, have, under certain limitations, the force of\r\n\r\nlegislative acts. All the members of the judiciary department are\r\n\r\nappointed by him, can be removed by him on the address of the two\r\n\r\nHouses of Parliament, and form, when he pleases to consult them,\r\n\r\none of his constitutional councils. One branch of the legislative\r\n\r\ndepartment forms also a great constitutional council to the\r\n\r\nexecutive chief, as, on another hand, it is the sole depositary\r\n\r\nof judicial power in cases of impeachment, and is invested with\r\n\r\nthe supreme appellate jurisdiction in all other cases. The\r\n\r\njudges, again, are so far connected with the legislative\r\n\r\ndepartment as often to attend and participate in its\r\n\r\ndeliberations, though not admitted to a legislative vote. From\r\n\r\nthese facts, by which Montesquieu was guided, it may clearly be\r\n\r\ninferred that, in saying \"There can be no liberty where the\r\n\r\nlegislative and executive powers are united in the same person,\r\n\r\nor body of magistrates,\" or, \"if the power of judging be not\r\n\r\nseparated from the legislative and executive powers,\" he did not\r\n\r\nmean that these departments ought to have no PARTIAL AGENCY in,\r\n\r\nor no CONTROL over, the acts of each other. His meaning, as his\r\n\r\nown words import, and still more conclusively as illustrated by\r\n\r\nthe example in his eye, can amount to no more than this, that\r\n\r\nwhere the WHOLE power of one department is exercised by the same\r\n\r\nhands which possess the WHOLE power of another department, the\r\n\r\nfundamental principles of a free constitution are subverted. This\r\n\r\nwould have been the case in the constitution examined by him, if\r\n\r\nthe king, who is the sole executive magistrate, had possessed\r\n\r\nalso the complete legislative power, or the supreme\r\n\r\nadministration of justice; or if the entire legislative body had\r\n\r\npossessed the supreme judiciary, or the supreme executive\r\n\r\nauthority. This, however, is not among the vices of that\r\n\r\nconstitution. The magistrate in whom the whole executive power\r\n\r\nresides cannot of himself make a law, though he can put a\r\n\r\nnegative on every law; nor administer justice in person, though\r\n\r\nhe has the appointment of those who do administer it. The judges\r\n\r\ncan exercise no executive prerogative, though they are shoots\r\n\r\nfrom the executive stock; nor any legislative function, though\r\n\r\nthey may be advised with by the legislative councils. The entire\r\n\r\nlegislature can perform no judiciary act, though by the joint act\r\n\r\nof two of its branches the judges may be removed from their\r\n\r\noffices, and though one of its branches is possessed of the\r\n\r\njudicial power in the last resort. The entire legislature, again,\r\n\r\ncan exercise no executive prerogative, though one of its branches\r\n\r\nconstitutes the supreme executive magistracy, and another, on the\r\n\r\nimpeachment of a third, can try and condemn all the subordinate\r\n\r\nofficers in the executive department. The reasons on which\r\n\r\nMontesquieu grounds his maxim are a further demonstration of his\r\n\r\nmeaning. \"When the legislative and executive powers are united\r\n\r\nin the same person or body,\" says he, \"there can be no liberty,\r\n\r\nbecause apprehensions may arise lest THE SAME monarch or senate\r\n\r\nshould ENACT tyrannical laws to EXECUTE them in a tyrannical\r\n\r\nmanner. \" Again: \"Were the power of judging joined with the\r\n\r\nlegislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed\r\n\r\nto arbitrary control, for THE JUDGE would then be THE LEGISLATOR.\r\n\r\nWere it joined to the executive power, THE JUDGE might behave\r\n\r\nwith all the violence of AN OPPRESSOR. \" Some of these reasons\r\n\r\nare more fully explained in other passages; but briefly stated as\r\n\r\nthey are here, they sufficiently establish the meaning which we\r\n\r\nhave put on this celebrated maxim of this celebrated author.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we look into the constitutions of the several States, we find\r\n\r\nthat, notwithstanding the emphatical and, in some instances, the\r\n\r\nunqualified terms in which this axiom has been laid down, there\r\n\r\nis not a single instance in which the several departments of\r\n\r\npower have been kept absolutely separate and distinct. New\r\n\r\nHampshire, whose constitution was the last formed, seems to have\r\n\r\nbeen fully aware of the impossibility and inexpediency of\r\n\r\navoiding any mixture whatever of these departments, and has\r\n\r\nqualified the doctrine by declaring \"that the legislative,\r\n\r\nexecutive, and judiciary powers ought to be kept as separate\r\n\r\nfrom, and independent of, each other AS THE NATURE OF A FREE\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT WILL ADMIT; OR AS IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT CHAIN OF\r\n\r\nCONNECTION THAT BINDS THE WHOLE FABRIC OF THE CONSTITUTION IN ONE\r\n\r\nINDISSOLUBLE BOND OF UNITY AND AMITY. \" Her constitution\r\n\r\naccordingly mixes these departments in several respects. The\r\n\r\nSenate, which is a branch of the legislative department, is also\r\n\r\na judicial tribunal for the trial of impeachments. The\r\n\r\nPresident, who is the head of the executive department, is the\r\n\r\npresiding member also of the Senate; and, besides an equal vote\r\n\r\nin all cases, has a casting vote in case of a tie. The executive\r\n\r\nhead is himself eventually elective every year by the\r\n\r\nlegislative department, and his council is every year chosen by\r\n\r\nand from the members of the same department. Several of the\r\n\r\nofficers of state are also appointed by the legislature. And the\r\n\r\nmembers of the judiciary department are appointed by the\r\n\r\nexecutive department. The constitution of Massachusetts has\r\n\r\nobserved a sufficient though less pointed caution, in expressing\r\n\r\nthis fundamental article of liberty. It declares \"that the\r\n\r\nlegislative department shall never exercise the executive and\r\n\r\njudicial powers, or either of them; the executive shall never\r\n\r\nexercise the legislative and judicial powers, or either of them;\r\n\r\nthe judicial shall never exercise the legislative and executive\r\n\r\npowers, or either of them. \" This declaration corresponds\r\n\r\nprecisely with the doctrine of Montesquieu, as it has been\r\n\r\nexplained, and is not in a single point violated by the plan of\r\n\r\nthe convention. It goes no farther than to prohibit any one of\r\n\r\nthe entire departments from exercising the powers of another\r\n\r\ndepartment. In the very Constitution to which it is prefixed, a\r\n\r\npartial mixture of powers has been admitted. The executive\r\n\r\nmagistrate has a qualified negative on the legislative body, and\r\n\r\nthe Senate, which is a part of the legislature, is a court of\r\n\r\nimpeachment for members both of the executive and judiciary\r\n\r\ndepartments. The members of the judiciary department, again, are\r\n\r\nappointable by the executive department, and removable by the\r\n\r\nsame authority on the address of the two legislative branches.\r\n\r\nLastly, a number of the officers of government are annually\r\n\r\nappointed by the legislative department. As the appointment to\r\n\r\noffices, particularly executive offices, is in its nature an\r\n\r\nexecutive function, the compilers of the Constitution have, in\r\n\r\nthis last point at least, violated the rule established by\r\n\r\nthemselves. I pass over the constitutions of Rhode Island and\r\n\r\nConnecticut, because they were formed prior to the Revolution,\r\n\r\nand even before the principle under examination had become an\r\n\r\nobject of political attention. The constitution of New York\r\n\r\ncontains no declaration on this subject; but appears very\r\n\r\nclearly to have been framed with an eye to the danger of\r\n\r\nimproperly blending the different departments. It gives,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, to the executive magistrate, a partial control over\r\n\r\nthe legislative department; and, what is more, gives a like\r\n\r\ncontrol to the judiciary department; and even blends the\r\n\r\nexecutive and judiciary departments in the exercise of this\r\n\r\ncontrol. In its council of appointment members of the\r\n\r\nlegislative are associated with the executive authority, in the\r\n\r\nappointment of officers, both executive and judiciary. And its\r\n\r\ncourt for the trial of impeachments and correction of errors is\r\n\r\nto consist of one branch of the legislature and the principal\r\n\r\nmembers of the judiciary department. The constitution of New\r\n\r\nJersey has blended the different powers of government more than\r\n\r\nany of the preceding. The governor, who is the executive\r\n\r\nmagistrate, is appointed by the legislature; is chancellor and\r\n\r\nordinary, or surrogate of the State; is a member of the Supreme\r\n\r\nCourt of Appeals, and president, with a casting vote, of one of\r\n\r\nthe legislative branches. The same legislative branch acts again\r\n\r\nas executive council of the governor, and with him constitutes\r\n\r\nthe Court of Appeals. The members of the judiciary department are\r\n\r\nappointed by the legislative department and removable by one\r\n\r\nbranch of it, on the impeachment of the other. According to the\r\n\r\nconstitution of Pennsylvania, the president, who is the head of\r\n\r\nthe executive department, is annually elected by a vote in which\r\n\r\nthe legislative department predominates. In conjunction with an\r\n\r\nexecutive council, he appoints the members of the judiciary\r\n\r\ndepartment, and forms a court of impeachment for trial of all\r\n\r\nofficers, judiciary as well as executive. The judges of the\r\n\r\nSupreme Court and justices of the peace seem also to be removable\r\n\r\nby the legislature; and the executive power of pardoning in\r\n\r\ncertain cases, to be referred to the same department. The members\r\n\r\nof the executive council are made EX-OFFICIO justices of peace\r\n\r\nthroughout the State. In Delaware, the chief executive magistrate\r\n\r\nis annually elected by the legislative department. The speakers\r\n\r\nof the two legislative branches are vice-presidents in the\r\n\r\nexecutive department. The executive chief, with six others,\r\n\r\nappointed, three by each of the legislative branches constitutes\r\n\r\nthe Supreme Court of Appeals; he is joined with the legislative\r\n\r\ndepartment in the appointment of the other judges. Throughout the\r\n\r\nStates, it appears that the members of the legislature may at the\r\n\r\nsame time be justices of the peace; in this State, the members of\r\n\r\none branch of it are EX-OFFICIO justices of the peace; as are\r\n\r\nalso the members of the executive council. The principal officers\r\n\r\nof the executive department are appointed by the legislative; and\r\n\r\none branch of the latter forms a court of impeachments. All\r\n\r\nofficers may be removed on address of the legislature. Maryland\r\n\r\nhas adopted the maxim in the most unqualified terms; declaring\r\n\r\nthat the legislative, executive, and judicial powers of\r\n\r\ngovernment ought to be forever separate and distinct from each\r\n\r\nother. Her constitution, notwithstanding, makes the executive\r\n\r\nmagistrate appointable by the legislative department; and the\r\n\r\nmembers of the judiciary by the executive department. The\r\n\r\nlanguage of Virginia is still more pointed on this subject. Her\r\n\r\nconstitution declares, \"that the legislative, executive, and\r\n\r\njudiciary departments shall be separate and distinct; so that\r\n\r\nneither exercise the powers properly belonging to the other; nor\r\n\r\nshall any person exercise the powers of more than one of them at\r\n\r\nthe same time, except that the justices of county courts shall be\r\n\r\neligible to either House of Assembly. \" Yet we find not only\r\n\r\nthis express exception, with respect to the members of the\r\n\r\ninferior courts, but that the chief magistrate, with his\r\n\r\nexecutive council, are appointable by the legislature; that two\r\n\r\nmembers of the latter are triennially displaced at the pleasure\r\n\r\nof the legislature; and that all the principal offices, both\r\n\r\nexecutive and judiciary, are filled by the same department. The\r\n\r\nexecutive prerogative of pardon, also, is in one case vested in\r\n\r\nthe legislative department. The constitution of North Carolina,\r\n\r\nwhich declares \"that the legislative, executive, and supreme\r\n\r\njudicial powers of government ought to be forever separate and\r\n\r\ndistinct from each other,\" refers, at the same time, to the\r\n\r\nlegislative department, the appointment not only of the executive\r\n\r\nchief, but all the principal officers within both that and the\r\n\r\njudiciary department. In South Carolina, the constitution makes\r\n\r\nthe executive magistracy eligible by the legislative department.\r\n\r\nIt gives to the latter, also, the appointment of the members of\r\n\r\nthe judiciary department, including even justices of the peace\r\n\r\nand sheriffs; and the appointment of officers in the executive\r\n\r\ndepartment, down to captains in the army and navy of the State.\r\n\r\nIn the constitution of Georgia, where it is declared \"that the\r\n\r\nlegislative, executive, and judiciary departments shall be\r\n\r\nseparate and distinct, so that neither exercise the powers\r\n\r\nproperly belonging to the other,\" we find that the executive\r\n\r\ndepartment is to be filled by appointments of the legislature;\r\n\r\nand the executive prerogative of pardon to be finally exercised\r\n\r\nby the same authority. Even justices of the peace are to be\r\n\r\nappointed by the legislature. In citing these cases, in which\r\n\r\nthe legislative, executive, and judiciary departments have not\r\n\r\nbeen kept totally separate and distinct, I wish not to be\r\n\r\nregarded as an advocate for the particular organizations of the\r\n\r\nseveral State governments. I am fully aware that among the many\r\n\r\nexcellent principles which they exemplify, they carry strong\r\n\r\nmarks of the haste, and still stronger of the inexperience, under\r\n\r\nwhich they were framed. It is but too obvious that in some\r\n\r\ninstances the fundamental principle under consideration has been\r\n\r\nviolated by too great a mixture, and even an actual\r\n\r\nconsolidation, of the different powers; and that in no instance\r\n\r\nhas a competent provision been made for maintaining in practice\r\n\r\nthe separation delineated on paper. What I have wished to evince\r\n\r\nis, that the charge brought against the proposed Constitution, of\r\n\r\nviolating the sacred maxim of free government, is warranted\r\n\r\nneither by the real meaning annexed to that maxim by its author,\r\n\r\nnor by the sense in which it has hitherto been understood in\r\n\r\nAmerica. This interesting subject will be resumed in the ensuing\r\n\r\npaper. PUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 48\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese Departments Should Not Be So Far Separated as to Have No\r\n\r\nConstitutional Control Over Each Other\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Friday, February 1, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADISON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nIT WAS shown in the last paper that the political apothegm there\r\n\r\nexamined does not require that the legislative, executive, and\r\n\r\njudiciary departments should be wholly unconnected with each\r\n\r\nother. I shall undertake, in the next place, to show that unless\r\n\r\nthese departments be so far connected and blended as to give to\r\n\r\neach a constitutional control over the others, the degree of\r\n\r\nseparation which the maxim requires, as essential to a free\r\n\r\ngovernment, can never in practice be duly maintained. It is\r\n\r\nagreed on all sides, that the powers properly belonging to one of\r\n\r\nthe departments ought not to be directly and completely\r\n\r\nadministered by either of the other departments. It is equally\r\n\r\nevident, that none of them ought to possess, directly or\r\n\r\nindirectly, an overruling influence over the others, in the\r\n\r\nadministration of their respective powers. It will not be denied,\r\n\r\nthat power is of an encroaching nature, and that it ought to be\r\n\r\neffectually restrained from passing the limits assigned to it.\r\n\r\nAfter discriminating, therefore, in theory, the several classes\r\n\r\nof power, as they may in their nature be legislative, executive,\r\n\r\nor judiciary, the next and most difficult task is to provide some\r\n\r\npractical security for each, against the invasion of the others.\r\n\r\nWhat this security ought to be, is the great problem to be\r\n\r\nsolved. Will it be sufficient to mark, with precision, the\r\n\r\nboundaries of these departments, in the constitution of the\r\n\r\ngovernment, and to trust to these parchment barriers against the\r\n\r\nencroaching spirit of power? This is the security which appears\r\n\r\nto have been principally relied on by the compilers of most of\r\n\r\nthe American constitutions. But experience assures us, that the\r\n\r\nefficacy of the provision has been greatly overrated; and that\r\n\r\nsome more adequate defense is indispensably necessary for the\r\n\r\nmore feeble, against the more powerful, members of the\r\n\r\ngovernment. The legislative department is everywhere extending\r\n\r\nthe sphere of its activity, and drawing all power into its\r\n\r\nimpetuous vortex. The founders of our republics have so much\r\n\r\nmerit for the wisdom which they have displayed, that no task can\r\n\r\nbe less pleasing than that of pointing out the errors into which\r\n\r\nthey have fallen. A respect for truth, however, obliges us to\r\n\r\nremark, that they seem never for a moment to have turned their\r\n\r\neyes from the danger to liberty from the overgrown and\r\n\r\nall-grasping prerogative of an hereditary magistrate, supported\r\n\r\nand fortified by an hereditary branch of the legislative\r\n\r\nauthority. They seem never to have recollected the danger from\r\n\r\nlegislative usurpations, which, by assembling all power in the\r\n\r\nsame hands, must lead to the same tyranny as is threatened by\r\n\r\nexecutive usurpations. In a government where numerous and\r\n\r\nextensive prerogatives are placed in the hands of an hereditary\r\n\r\nmonarch, the executive department is very justly regarded as the\r\n\r\nsource of danger, and watched with all the jealousy which a zeal\r\n\r\nfor liberty ought to inspire. In a democracy, where a multitude\r\n\r\nof people exercise in person the legislative functions, and are\r\n\r\ncontinually exposed, by their incapacity for regular deliberation\r\n\r\nand concerted measures, to the ambitious intrigues of their\r\n\r\nexecutive magistrates, tyranny may well be apprehended, on some\r\n\r\nfavorable emergency, to start up in the same quarter. But in a\r\n\r\nrepresentative republic, where the executive magistracy is\r\n\r\ncarefully limited; both in the extent and the duration of its\r\n\r\npower; and where the legislative power is exercised by an\r\n\r\nassembly, which is inspired, by a supposed influence over the\r\n\r\npeople, with an intrepid confidence in its own strength; which is\r\n\r\nsufficiently numerous to feel all the passions which actuate a\r\n\r\nmultitude, yet not so numerous as to be incapable of pursuing the\r\n\r\nobjects of its passions, by means which reason prescribes; it is\r\n\r\nagainst the enterprising ambition of this department that the\r\n\r\npeople ought to indulge all their jealousy and exhaust all their\r\n\r\nprecautions. The legislative department derives a superiority in\r\n\r\nour governments from other circumstances. Its constitutional\r\n\r\npowers being at once more extensive, and less susceptible of\r\n\r\nprecise limits, it can, with the greater facility, mask, under\r\n\r\ncomplicated and indirect measures, the encroachments which it\r\n\r\nmakes on the co-ordinate departments. It is not unfrequently a\r\n\r\nquestion of real nicety in legislative bodies, whether the\r\n\r\noperation of a particular measure will, or will not, extend\r\n\r\nbeyond the legislative sphere. On the other side, the executive\r\n\r\npower being restrained within a narrower compass, and being more\r\n\r\nsimple in its nature, and the judiciary being described by\r\n\r\nlandmarks still less uncertain, projects of usurpation by either\r\n\r\nof these departments would immediately betray and defeat\r\n\r\nthemselves. Nor is this all: as the legislative department alone\r\n\r\nhas access to the pockets of the people, and has in some\r\n\r\nconstitutions full discretion, and in all a prevailing influence,\r\n\r\nover the pecuniary rewards of those who fill the other\r\n\r\ndepartments, a dependence is thus created in the latter, which\r\n\r\ngives still greater facility to encroachments of the former. I\r\n\r\nhave appealed to our own experience for the truth of what I\r\n\r\nadvance on this subject. Were it necessary to verify this\r\n\r\nexperience by particular proofs, they might be multiplied\r\n\r\nwithout end. I might find a witness in every citizen who has\r\n\r\nshared in, or been attentive to, the course of public\r\n\r\nadministrations. I might collect vouchers in abundance from the\r\n\r\nrecords and archives of every State in the Union. But as a more\r\n\r\nconcise, and at the same time equally satisfactory, evidence, I\r\n\r\nwill refer to the example of two States, attested by two\r\n\r\nunexceptionable authorities. The first example is that of\r\n\r\nVirginia, a State which, as we have seen, has expressly declared\r\n\r\nin its constitution, that the three great departments ought not\r\n\r\nto be intermixed. The authority in support of it is Mr.\r\n\r\nJefferson, who, besides his other advantages for remarking the\r\n\r\noperation of the government, was himself the chief magistrate of\r\n\r\nit. In order to convey fully the ideas with which his experience\r\n\r\nhad impressed him on this subject, it will be necessary to quote\r\n\r\na passage of some length from his very interesting \"Notes on the\r\n\r\nState of Virginia,\" p. 195. \"All the powers of government,\r\n\r\nlegislative, executive, and judiciary, result to the legislative\r\n\r\nbody. The concentrating these in the same hands, is precisely the\r\n\r\ndefinition of despotic government. It will be no alleviation,\r\n\r\nthat these powers will be exercised by a plurality of hands, and\r\n\r\nnot by a single one. One hundred and seventy-three despots would\r\n\r\nsurely be as oppressive as one. Let those who doubt it, turn\r\n\r\ntheir eyes on the republic of Venice. As little will it avail us,\r\n\r\nthat they are chosen by ourselves. An ELECTIVE DESPOTISM was not\r\n\r\nthe government we fought for; but one which should not only be\r\n\r\nfounded on free principles, but in which the powers of government\r\n\r\nshould be so divided and balanced among several bodies of\r\n\r\nmagistracy, as that no one could transcend their legal limits,\r\n\r\nwithout being effectually checked and restrained by the others.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, that convention which passed the ordinance of\r\n\r\ngovernment, laid its foundation on this basis, that the\r\n\r\nlegislative, executive, and judiciary departments should be\r\n\r\nseparate and distinct, so that no person should exercise the\r\n\r\npowers of more than one of them at the same time. BUT NO BARRIER\r\n\r\nWAS PROVIDED BETWEEN THESE SEVERAL POWERS. The judiciary and the\r\n\r\nexecutive members were left dependent on the legislative for\r\n\r\ntheir subsistence in office, and some of them for their\r\n\r\ncontinuance in it. If, therefore, the legislature assumes\r\n\r\nexecutive and judiciary powers, no opposition is likely to be\r\n\r\nmade; nor, if made, can be effectual; because in that case they\r\n\r\nmay put their proceedings into the form of acts of Assembly,\r\n\r\nwhich will render them obligatory on the other branches. They\r\n\r\nhave accordingly, IN MANY instances, DECIDED RIGHTS which should\r\n\r\nhave been left to JUDICIARY CONTROVERSY, and THE DIRECTION OF THE\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE, DURING THE WHOLE TIME OF THEIR SESSION, IS BECOMING\r\n\r\nHABITUAL AND FAMILIAR. \"The other State which I shall take for\r\n\r\nan example is Pennsylvania; and the other authority, the Council\r\n\r\nof Censors, which assembled in the years 1783 and 1784. A part of\r\n\r\nthe duty of this body, as marked out by the constitution, was\r\n\r\n\"to inquire whether the constitution had been preserved\r\n\r\ninviolate in every part; and whether the legislative and\r\n\r\nexecutive branches of government had performed their duty as\r\n\r\nguardians of the people, or assumed to themselves, or exercised,\r\n\r\nother or greater powers than they are entitled to by the\r\n\r\nconstitution. \" In the execution of this trust, the council were\r\n\r\nnecessarily led to a comparison of both the legislative and\r\n\r\nexecutive proceedings, with the constitutional powers of these\r\n\r\ndepartments; and from the facts enumerated, and to the truth of\r\n\r\nmost of which both sides in the council subscribed, it appears\r\n\r\nthat the constitution had been flagrantly violated by the\r\n\r\nlegislature in a variety of important instances. A great number\r\n\r\nof laws had been passed, violating, without any apparent\r\n\r\nnecessity, the rule requiring that all bills of a public nature\r\n\r\nshall be previously printed for the consideration of the people;\r\n\r\nalthough this is one of the precautions chiefly relied on by the\r\n\r\nconstitution against improper acts of legislature. The\r\n\r\nconstitutional trial by jury had been violated, and powers\r\n\r\nassumed which had not been delegated by the constitution.\r\n\r\nExecutive powers had been usurped. The salaries of the judges,\r\n\r\nwhich the constitution expressly requires to be fixed, had been\r\n\r\noccasionally varied; and cases belonging to the judiciary\r\n\r\ndepartment frequently drawn within legislative cognizance and\r\n\r\ndetermination. Those who wish to see the several particulars\r\n\r\nfalling under each of these heads, may consult the journals of\r\n\r\nthe council, which are in print. Some of them, it will be found,\r\n\r\nmay be imputable to peculiar circumstances connected with the\r\n\r\nwar; but the greater part of them may be considered as the\r\n\r\nspontaneous shoots of an ill-constituted government. It appears,\r\n\r\nalso, that the executive department had not been innocent of\r\n\r\nfrequent breaches of the constitution. There are three\r\n\r\nobservations, however, which ought to be made on this head:\r\n\r\nFIRST, a great proportion of the instances were either\r\n\r\nimmediately produced by the necessities of the war, or\r\n\r\nrecommended by Congress or the commander-in-chief; SECONDLY, in\r\n\r\nmost of the other instances, they conformed either to the\r\n\r\ndeclared or the known sentiments of the legislative department;\r\n\r\nTHIRDLY, the executive department of Pennsylvania is\r\n\r\ndistinguished from that of the other States by the number of\r\n\r\nmembers composing it. In this respect, it has as much affinity\r\n\r\nto a legislative assembly as to an executive council. And being\r\n\r\nat once exempt from the restraint of an individual responsibility\r\n\r\nfor the acts of the body, and deriving confidence from mutual\r\n\r\nexample and joint influence, unauthorized measures would, of\r\n\r\ncourse, be more freely hazarded, than where the executive\r\n\r\ndepartment is administered by a single hand, or by a few hands.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion which I am warranted in drawing from these\r\n\r\nobservations is, that a mere demarcation on parchment of the\r\n\r\nconstitutional limits of the several departments, is not a\r\n\r\nsufficient guard against those encroachments which lead to a\r\n\r\ntyrannical concentration of all the powers of government in the\r\n\r\nsame hands. PUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 49\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethod of Guarding Against the Encroachments of Any One\r\n\r\nDepartment of Government by Appealing to the People Through a\r\n\r\nConvention\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, February 5, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON OR MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTHE author of the \"Notes on the State of Virginia,\" quoted in\r\n\r\nthe last paper, has subjoined to that valuable work the draught\r\n\r\nof a constitution, which had been prepared in order to be laid\r\n\r\nbefore a convention, expected to be called in 1783, by the\r\n\r\nlegislature, for the establishment of a constitution for that\r\n\r\ncommonwealth. The plan, like every thing from the same pen, marks\r\n\r\na turn of thinking, original, comprehensive, and accurate; and is\r\n\r\nthe more worthy of attention as it equally displays a fervent\r\n\r\nattachment to republican government and an enlightened view of\r\n\r\nthe dangerous propensities against which it ought to be guarded.\r\n\r\nOne of the precautions which he proposes, and on which he appears\r\n\r\nultimately to rely as a palladium to the weaker departments of\r\n\r\npower against the invasions of the stronger, is perhaps\r\n\r\naltogether his own, and as it immediately relates to the subject\r\n\r\nof our present inquiry, ought not to be overlooked. His\r\n\r\nproposition is, \"that whenever any two of the three branches of\r\n\r\ngovernment shall concur in opinion, each by the voices of two\r\n\r\nthirds of their whole number, that a convention is necessary for\r\n\r\naltering the constitution, or CORRECTING BREACHES OF IT, a\r\n\r\nconvention shall be called for the purpose. \"As the people are\r\n\r\nthe only legitimate fountain of power, and it is from them that\r\n\r\nthe constitutional charter, under which the several branches of\r\n\r\ngovernment hold their power, is derived, it seems strictly\r\n\r\nconsonant to the republican theory, to recur to the same original\r\n\r\nauthority, not only whenever it may be necessary to enlarge,\r\n\r\ndiminish, or new-model the powers of the government, but also\r\n\r\nwhenever any one of the departments may commit encroachments on\r\n\r\nthe chartered authorities of the others. The several departments\r\n\r\nbeing perfectly co-ordinate by the terms of their common\r\n\r\ncommission, none of them, it is evident, can pretend to an\r\n\r\nexclusive or superior right of settling the boundaries between\r\n\r\ntheir respective powers; and how are the encroachments of the\r\n\r\nstronger to be prevented, or the wrongs of the weaker to be\r\n\r\nredressed, without an appeal to the people themselves, who, as\r\n\r\nthe grantors of the commissions, can alone declare its true\r\n\r\nmeaning, and enforce its observance? There is certainly great\r\n\r\nforce in this reasoning, and it must be allowed to prove that a\r\n\r\nconstitutional road to the decision of the people ought to be\r\n\r\nmarked out and kept open, for certain great and extraordinary\r\n\r\noccasions. But there appear to be insuperable objections against\r\n\r\nthe proposed recurrence to the people, as a provision in all\r\n\r\ncases for keeping the several departments of power within their\r\n\r\nconstitutional limits. In the first place, the provision does not\r\n\r\nreach the case of a combination of two of the departments against\r\n\r\nthe third. If the legislative authority, which possesses so many\r\n\r\nmeans of operating on the motives of the other departments,\r\n\r\nshould be able to gain to its interest either of the others, or\r\n\r\neven one third of its members, the remaining department could\r\n\r\nderive no advantage from its remedial provision. I do not dwell,\r\n\r\nhowever, on this objection, because it may be thought to be\r\n\r\nrather against the modification of the principle, than against\r\n\r\nthe principle itself. In the next place, it may be considered as\r\n\r\nan objection inherent in the principle, that as every appeal to\r\n\r\nthe people would carry an implication of some defect in the\r\n\r\ngovernment, frequent appeals would, in a great measure, deprive\r\n\r\nthe government of that veneration which time bestows on every\r\n\r\nthing, and without which perhaps the wisest and freest\r\n\r\ngovernments would not possess the requisite stability. If it be\r\n\r\ntrue that all governments rest on opinion, it is no less true\r\n\r\nthat the strength of opinion in each individual, and its\r\n\r\npractical influence on his conduct, depend much on the number\r\n\r\nwhich he supposes to have entertained the same opinion. The\r\n\r\nreason of man, like man himself, is timid and cautious when left\r\n\r\nalone, and acquires firmness and confidence in proportion to the\r\n\r\nnumber with which it is associated. When the examples which\r\n\r\nfortify opinion are ANCIENT as well as NUMEROUS, they are known\r\n\r\nto have a double effect. In a nation of philosophers, this\r\n\r\nconsideration ought to be disregarded. A reverence for the laws\r\n\r\nwould be sufficiently inculcated by the voice of an enlightened\r\n\r\nreason. But a nation of philosophers is as little to be expected\r\n\r\nas the philosophical race of kings wished for by Plato. And in\r\n\r\nevery other nation, the most rational government will not find it\r\n\r\na superfluous advantage to have the prejudices of the community\r\n\r\non its side. The danger of disturbing the public tranquillity by\r\n\r\ninteresting too strongly the public passions, is a still more\r\n\r\nserious objection against a frequent reference of constitutional\r\n\r\nquestions to the decision of the whole society. Notwithstanding\r\n\r\nthe success which has attended the revisions of our established\r\n\r\nforms of government, and which does so much honor to the virtue\r\n\r\nand intelligence of the people of America, it must be confessed\r\n\r\nthat the experiments are of too ticklish a nature to be\r\n\r\nunnecessarily multiplied. We are to recollect that all the\r\n\r\nexisting constitutions were formed in the midst of a danger which\r\n\r\nrepressed the passions most unfriendly to order and concord; of\r\n\r\nan enthusiastic confidence of the people in their patriotic\r\n\r\nleaders, which stifled the ordinary diversity of opinions on\r\n\r\ngreat national questions; of a universal ardor for new and\r\n\r\nopposite forms, produced by a universal resentment and\r\n\r\nindignation against the ancient government; and whilst no spirit\r\n\r\nof party connected with the changes to be made, or the abuses to\r\n\r\nbe reformed, could mingle its leaven in the operation. The future\r\n\r\nsituations in which we must expect to be usually placed, do not\r\n\r\npresent any equivalent security against the danger which is\r\n\r\napprehended. But the greatest objection of all is, that the\r\n\r\ndecisions which would probably result from such appeals would not\r\n\r\nanswer the purpose of maintaining the constitutional equilibrium\r\n\r\nof the government. We have seen that the tendency of republican\r\n\r\ngovernments is to an aggrandizement of the legislative at the\r\n\r\nexpense of the other departments. The appeals to the people,\r\n\r\ntherefore, would usually be made by the executive and judiciary\r\n\r\ndepartments. But whether made by one side or the other, would\r\n\r\neach side enjoy equal advantages on the trial? Let us view their\r\n\r\ndifferent situations. The members of the executive and judiciary\r\n\r\ndepartments are few in number, and can be personally known to a\r\n\r\nsmall part only of the people. The latter, by the mode of their\r\n\r\nappointment, as well as by the nature and permanency of it, are\r\n\r\ntoo far removed from the people to share much in their\r\n\r\nprepossessions. The former are generally the objects of jealousy,\r\n\r\nand their administration is always liable to be discolored and\r\n\r\nrendered unpopular. The members of the legislative department, on\r\n\r\nthe other hand, are numberous. They are distributed and dwell\r\n\r\namong the people at large. Their connections of blood, of\r\n\r\nfriendship, and of acquaintance embrace a great proportion of the\r\n\r\nmost influential part of the society. The nature of their public\r\n\r\ntrust implies a personal influence among the people, and that\r\n\r\nthey are more immediately the confidential guardians of the\r\n\r\nrights and liberties of the people. With these advantages, it can\r\n\r\nhardly be supposed that the adverse party would have an equal\r\n\r\nchance for a favorable issue. But the legislative party would not\r\n\r\nonly be able to plead their cause most successfully with the\r\n\r\npeople. They would probably be constituted themselves the judges.\r\n\r\nThe same influence which had gained them an election into the\r\n\r\nlegislature, would gain them a seat in the convention. If this\r\n\r\nshould not be the case with all, it would probably be the case\r\n\r\nwith many, and pretty certainly with those leading characters, on\r\n\r\nwhom every thing depends in such bodies. The convention, in\r\n\r\nshort, would be composed chiefly of men who had been, who\r\n\r\nactually were, or who expected to be, members of the department\r\n\r\nwhose conduct was arraigned. They would consequently be parties\r\n\r\nto the very question to be decided by them. It might, however,\r\n\r\nsometimes happen, that appeals would be made under circumstances\r\n\r\nless adverse to the executive and judiciary departments. The\r\n\r\nusurpations of the legislature might be so flagrant and so\r\n\r\nsudden, as to admit of no specious coloring. A strong party\r\n\r\namong themselves might take side with the other branches. The\r\n\r\nexecutive power might be in the hands of a peculiar favorite of\r\n\r\nthe people. In such a posture of things, the public decision\r\n\r\nmight be less swayed by prepossessions in favor of the\r\n\r\nlegislative party. But still it could never be expected to turn\r\n\r\non the true merits of the question. It would inevitably be\r\n\r\nconnected with the spirit of pre-existing parties, or of parties\r\n\r\nspringing out of the question itself. It would be connected with\r\n\r\npersons of distinguished character and extensive influence in the\r\n\r\ncommunity. It would be pronounced by the very men who had been\r\n\r\nagents in, or opponents of, the measures to which the decision\r\n\r\nwould relate. The PASSIONS, therefore, not the REASON, of the\r\n\r\npublic would sit in judgment. But it is the reason, alone, of the\r\n\r\npublic, that ought to control and regulate the government. The\r\n\r\npassions ought to be controlled and regulated by the government.\r\n\r\nWe found in the last paper, that mere declarations in the written\r\n\r\nconstitution are not sufficient to restrain the several\r\n\r\ndepartments within their legal rights. It appears in this, that\r\n\r\noccasional appeals to the people would be neither a proper nor an\r\n\r\neffectual provision for that purpose. How far the provisions of a\r\n\r\ndifferent nature contained in the plan above quoted might be\r\n\r\nadequate, I do not examine. Some of them are unquestionably\r\n\r\nfounded on sound political principles, and all of them are framed\r\n\r\nwith singular ingenuity and precision. PUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 50\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeriodical Appeals to the People Considered\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, February 5, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON OR MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nIT MAY be contended, perhaps, that instead of OCCASIONAL appeals\r\n\r\nto the people, which are liable to the objections urged against\r\n\r\nthem, PERIODICAL appeals are the proper and adequate means of\r\n\r\nPREVENTING AND CORRECTING INFRACTIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION. It\r\n\r\nwill be attended to, that in the examination of these expedients,\r\n\r\nI confine myself to their aptitude for ENFORCING the\r\n\r\nConstitution, by keeping the several departments of power within\r\n\r\ntheir due bounds, without particularly considering them as\r\n\r\nprovisions for ALTERING the Constitution itself. In the first\r\n\r\nview, appeals to the people at fixed periods appear to be nearly\r\n\r\nas ineligible as appeals on particular occasions as they emerge.\r\n\r\nIf the periods be separated by short intervals, the measures to\r\n\r\nbe reviewed and rectified will have been of recent date, and will\r\n\r\nbe connected with all the circumstances which tend to vitiate and\r\n\r\npervert the result of occasional revisions. If the periods be\r\n\r\ndistant from each other, the same remark will be applicable to\r\n\r\nall recent measures; and in proportion as the remoteness of the\r\n\r\nothers may favor a dispassionate review of them, this advantage\r\n\r\nis inseparable from inconveniences which seem to counterbalance\r\n\r\nit. In the first place, a distant prospect of public censure\r\n\r\nwould be a very feeble restraint on power from those excesses to\r\n\r\nwhich it might be urged by the force of present motives. Is it to\r\n\r\nbe imagined that a legislative assembly, consisting of a hundred\r\n\r\nor two hundred members, eagerly bent on some favorite object, and\r\n\r\nbreaking through the restraints of the Constitution in pursuit of\r\n\r\nit, would be arrested in their career, by considerations drawn\r\n\r\nfrom a censorial revision of their conduct at the future distance\r\n\r\nof ten, fifteen, or twenty years? In the next place, the abuses\r\n\r\nwould often have completed their mischievous effects before the\r\n\r\nremedial provision would be applied. And in the last place, where\r\n\r\nthis might not be the case, they would be of long standing, would\r\n\r\nhave taken deep root, and would not easily be extirpated. The\r\n\r\nscheme of revising the constitution, in order to correct recent\r\n\r\nbreaches of it, as well as for other purposes, has been actually\r\n\r\ntried in one of the States. One of the objects of the Council of\r\n\r\nCensors which met in Pennsylvania in 1783 and 1784, was, as we\r\n\r\nhave seen, to inquire, \"whether the constitution had been\r\n\r\nviolated, and whether the legislative and executive departments\r\n\r\nhad encroached upon each other. \" This important and novel\r\n\r\nexperiment in politics merits, in several points of view, very\r\n\r\nparticular attention. In some of them it may, perhaps, as a\r\n\r\nsingle experiment, made under circumstances somewhat peculiar, be\r\n\r\nthought to be not absolutely conclusive. But as applied to the\r\n\r\ncase under consideration, it involves some facts, which I venture\r\n\r\nto remark, as a complete and satisfactory illustration of the\r\n\r\nreasoning which I have employed. First. It appears, from the\r\n\r\nnames of the gentlemen who composed the council, that some, at\r\n\r\nleast, of its most active members had also been active and\r\n\r\nleading characters in the parties which pre-existed in the State.\r\n\r\nSecondly. It appears that the same active and leading members of\r\n\r\nthe council had been active and influential members of the\r\n\r\nlegislative and executive branches, within the period to be\r\n\r\nreviewed; and even patrons or opponents of the very measures to\r\n\r\nbe thus brought to the test of the constitution. Two of the\r\n\r\nmembers had been vice-presidents of the State, and several other\r\n\r\nmembers of the executive council, within the seven preceding\r\n\r\nyears. One of them had been speaker, and a number of others\r\n\r\ndistinguished members, of the legislative assembly within the\r\n\r\nsame period. Thirdly. Every page of their proceedings witnesses\r\n\r\nthe effect of all these circumstances on the temper of their\r\n\r\ndeliberations. Throughout the continuance of the council, it was\r\n\r\nsplit into two fixed and violent parties. The fact is\r\n\r\nacknowledged and lamented by themselves. Had this not been the\r\n\r\ncase, the face of their proceedings exhibits a proof equally\r\n\r\nsatisfactory. In all questions, however unimportant in\r\n\r\nthemselves, or unconnected with each other, the same names stand\r\n\r\ninvariably contrasted on the opposite columns. Every unbiased\r\n\r\nobserver may infer, without danger of mistake, and at the same\r\n\r\ntime without meaning to reflect on either party, or any\r\n\r\nindividuals of either party, that, unfortunately, PASSION, not\r\n\r\nREASON, must have presided over their decisions. When men\r\n\r\nexercise their reason coolly and freely on a variety of distinct\r\n\r\nquestions, they inevitably fall into different opinions on some\r\n\r\nof them. When they are governed by a common passion, their\r\n\r\nopinions, if they are so to be called, will be the same.\r\n\r\nFourthly. It is at least problematical, whether the decisions of\r\n\r\nthis body do not, in several instances, misconstrue the limits\r\n\r\nprescribed for the legislative and executive departments, instead\r\n\r\nof reducing and limiting them within their constitutional places.\r\n\r\nFifthly. I have never understood that the decisions of the\r\n\r\ncouncil on constitutional questions, whether rightly or\r\n\r\nerroneously formed, have had any effect in varying the practice\r\n\r\nfounded on legislative constructions. It even appears, if I\r\n\r\nmistake not, that in one instance the contemporary legislature\r\n\r\ndenied the constructions of the council, and actually prevailed\r\n\r\nin the contest. This censorial body, therefore, proves at the\r\n\r\nsame time, by its researches, the existence of the disease, and\r\n\r\nby its example, the inefficacy of the remedy. This conclusion\r\n\r\ncannot be invalidated by alleging that the State in which the\r\n\r\nexperiment was made was at that crisis, and had been for a long\r\n\r\ntime before, violently heated and distracted by the rage of\r\n\r\nparty. Is it to be presumed, that at any future septennial epoch\r\n\r\nthe same State will be free from parties? Is it to be presumed\r\n\r\nthat any other State, at the same or any other given period, will\r\n\r\nbe exempt from them? Such an event ought to be neither presumed\r\n\r\nnor desired; because an extinction of parties necessarily implies\r\n\r\neither a universal alarm for the public safety, or an absolute\r\n\r\nextinction of liberty. Were the precaution taken of excluding\r\n\r\nfrom the assemblies elected by the people, to revise the\r\n\r\npreceding administration of the government, all persons who\r\n\r\nshould have been concerned with the government within the given\r\n\r\nperiod, the difficulties would not be obviated. The important\r\n\r\ntask would probably devolve on men, who, with inferior\r\n\r\ncapacities, would in other respects be little better qualified.\r\n\r\nAlthough they might not have been personally concerned in the\r\n\r\nadministration, and therefore not immediately agents in the\r\n\r\nmeasures to be examined, they would probably have been involved\r\n\r\nin the parties connected with these measures, and have been\r\n\r\nelected under their auspices. PUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 51\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Structure of the Government Must Furnish the Proper Checks\r\n\r\nand Balances Between the Different Departments\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Friday, February 8, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON OR MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTO WHAT expedient, then, shall we finally resort, for maintaining\r\n\r\nin practice the necessary partition of power among the several\r\n\r\ndepartments, as laid down in the Constitution? The only answer\r\n\r\nthat can be given is, that as all these exterior provisions are\r\n\r\nfound to be inadequate, the defect must be supplied, by so\r\n\r\ncontriving the interior structure of the government as that its\r\n\r\nseveral constituent parts may, by their mutual relations, be the\r\n\r\nmeans of keeping each other in their proper places. Without\r\n\r\npresuming to undertake a full development of this important idea,\r\n\r\nI will hazard a few general observations, which may perhaps place\r\n\r\nit in a clearer light, and enable us to form a more correct\r\n\r\njudgment of the principles and structure of the government\r\n\r\nplanned by the convention. In order to lay a due foundation for\r\n\r\nthat separate and distinct exercise of the different powers of\r\n\r\ngovernment, which to a certain extent is admitted on all hands to\r\n\r\nbe essential to the preservation of liberty, it is evident that\r\n\r\neach department should have a will of its own; and consequently\r\n\r\nshould be so constituted that the members of each should have as\r\n\r\nlittle agency as possible in the appointment of the members of\r\n\r\nthe others. Were this principle rigorously adhered to, it would\r\n\r\nrequire that all the appointments for the supreme executive,\r\n\r\nlegislative, and judiciary magistracies should be drawn from the\r\n\r\nsame fountain of authority, the people, through channels having\r\n\r\nno communication whatever with one another. Perhaps such a plan\r\n\r\nof constructing the several departments would be less difficult\r\n\r\nin practice than it may in contemplation appear. Some\r\n\r\ndifficulties, however, and some additional expense would attend\r\n\r\nthe execution of it. Some deviations, therefore, from the\r\n\r\nprinciple must be admitted. In the constitution of the judiciary\r\n\r\ndepartment in particular, it might be inexpedient to insist\r\n\r\nrigorously on the principle: first, because peculiar\r\n\r\nqualifications being essential in the members, the primary\r\n\r\nconsideration ought to be to select that mode of choice which\r\n\r\nbest secures these qualifications; secondly, because the\r\n\r\npermanent tenure by which the appointments are held in that\r\n\r\ndepartment, must soon destroy all sense of dependence on the\r\n\r\nauthority conferring them. It is equally evident, that the\r\n\r\nmembers of each department should be as little dependent as\r\n\r\npossible on those of the others, for the emoluments annexed to\r\n\r\ntheir offices. Were the executive magistrate, or the judges, not\r\n\r\nindependent of the legislature in this particular, their\r\n\r\nindependence in every other would be merely nominal. But the\r\n\r\ngreat security against a gradual concentration of the several\r\n\r\npowers in the same department, consists in giving to those who\r\n\r\nadminister each department the necessary constitutional means and\r\n\r\npersonal motives to resist encroachments of the others. The\r\n\r\nprovision for defense must in this, as in all other cases, be\r\n\r\nmade commensurate to the danger of attack. Ambition must be made\r\n\r\nto counteract ambition. The interest of the man must be\r\n\r\nconnected with the constitutional rights of the place. It may be\r\n\r\na reflection on human nature, that such devices should be\r\n\r\nnecessary to control the abuses of government. But what is\r\n\r\ngovernment itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human\r\n\r\nnature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If\r\n\r\nangels were to govern men, neither external nor internal\r\n\r\ncontrols on government would be necessary. In framing a\r\n\r\ngovernment which is to be administered by men over men, the great\r\n\r\ndifficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to\r\n\r\ncontrol the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control\r\n\r\nitself. A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary\r\n\r\ncontrol on the government; but experience has taught mankind the\r\n\r\nnecessity of auxiliary precautions. This policy of supplying, by\r\n\r\nopposite and rival interests, the defect of better motives, might\r\n\r\nbe traced through the whole system of human affairs, private as\r\n\r\nwell as public. We see it particularly displayed in all the\r\n\r\nsubordinate distributions of power, where the constant aim is to\r\n\r\ndivide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that\r\n\r\neach may be a check on the other that the private interest of\r\n\r\nevery individual may be a sentinel over the public rights. These\r\n\r\ninventions of prudence cannot be less requisite in the\r\n\r\ndistribution of the supreme powers of the State. But it is not\r\n\r\npossible to give to each department an equal power of\r\n\r\nself-defense. In republican government, the legislative\r\n\r\nauthority necessarily predominates. The remedy for this\r\n\r\ninconveniency is to divide the legislature into different\r\n\r\nbranches; and to render them, by different modes of election and\r\n\r\ndifferent principles of action, as little connected with each\r\n\r\nother as the nature of their common functions and their common\r\n\r\ndependence on the society will admit. It may even be necessary\r\n\r\nto guard against dangerous encroachments by still further\r\n\r\nprecautions. As the weight of the legislative authority requires\r\n\r\nthat it should be thus divided, the weakness of the executive may\r\n\r\nrequire, on the other hand, that it should be fortified. An\r\n\r\nabsolute negative on the legislature appears, at first view, to\r\n\r\nbe the natural defense with which the executive magistrate should\r\n\r\nbe armed. But perhaps it would be neither altogether safe nor\r\n\r\nalone sufficient. On ordinary occasions it might not be exerted\r\n\r\nwith the requisite firmness, and on extraordinary occasions it\r\n\r\nmight be perfidiously abused. May not this defect of an absolute\r\n\r\nnegative be supplied by some qualified connection between this\r\n\r\nweaker department and the weaker branch of the stronger\r\n\r\ndepartment, by which the latter may be led to support the\r\n\r\nconstitutional rights of the former, without being too much\r\n\r\ndetached from the rights of its own department? If the principles\r\n\r\non which these observations are founded be just, as I persuade\r\n\r\nmyself they are, and they be applied as a criterion to the\r\n\r\nseveral State constitutions, and to the federal Constitution it\r\n\r\nwill be found that if the latter does not perfectly correspond\r\n\r\nwith them, the former are infinitely less able to bear such a\r\n\r\ntest. There are, moreover, two considerations particularly\r\n\r\napplicable to the federal system of America, which place that\r\n\r\nsystem in a very interesting point of view. First. In a single\r\n\r\nrepublic, all the power surrendered by the people is submitted to\r\n\r\nthe administration of a single government; and the usurpations\r\n\r\nare guarded against by a division of the government into distinct\r\n\r\nand separate departments. In the compound republic of America,\r\n\r\nthe power surrendered by the people is first divided between two\r\n\r\ndistinct governments, and then the portion allotted to each\r\n\r\nsubdivided among distinct and separate departments. Hence a\r\n\r\ndouble security arises to the rights of the people. The different\r\n\r\ngovernments will control each other, at the same time that each\r\n\r\nwill be controlled by itself. Second. It is of great importance\r\n\r\nin a republic not only to guard the society against the\r\n\r\noppression of its rulers, but to guard one part of the society\r\n\r\nagainst the injustice of the other part. Different interests\r\n\r\nnecessarily exist in different classes of citizens. If a\r\n\r\nmajority be united by a common interest, the rights of the\r\n\r\nminority will be insecure. There are but two methods of\r\n\r\nproviding against this evil: the one by creating a will in the\r\n\r\ncommunity independent of the majority that is, of the society\r\n\r\nitself; the other, by comprehending in the society so many\r\n\r\nseparate descriptions of citizens as will render an unjust\r\n\r\ncombination of a majority of the whole very improbable, if not\r\n\r\nimpracticable. The first method prevails in all governments\r\n\r\npossessing an hereditary or self-appointed authority. This, at\r\n\r\nbest, is but a precarious security; because a power independent\r\n\r\nof the society may as well espouse the unjust views of the major,\r\n\r\nas the rightful interests of the minor party, and may possibly be\r\n\r\nturned against both parties. The second method will be\r\n\r\nexemplified in the federal republic of the United States. Whilst\r\n\r\nall authority in it will be derived from and dependent on the\r\n\r\nsociety, the society itself will be broken into so many parts,\r\n\r\ninterests, and classes of citizens, that the rights of\r\n\r\nindividuals, or of the minority, will be in little danger from\r\n\r\ninterested combinations of the majority. In a free government\r\n\r\nthe security for civil rights must be the same as that for\r\n\r\nreligious rights. It consists in the one case in the\r\n\r\nmultiplicity of interests, and in the other in the multiplicity\r\n\r\nof sects. The degree of security in both cases will depend on\r\n\r\nthe number of interests and sects; and this may be presumed to\r\n\r\ndepend on the extent of country and number of people comprehended\r\n\r\nunder the same government. This view of the subject must\r\n\r\nparticularly recommend a proper federal system to all the sincere\r\n\r\nand considerate friends of republican government, since it shows\r\n\r\nthat in exact proportion as the territory of the Union may be\r\n\r\nformed into more circumscribed Confederacies, or States\r\n\r\noppressive combinations of a majority will be facilitated: the\r\n\r\nbest security, under the republican forms, for the rights of\r\n\r\nevery class of citizens, will be diminished: and consequently the\r\n\r\nstability and independence of some member of the government, the\r\n\r\nonly other security, must be proportionately increased. Justice\r\n\r\nis the end of government. It is the end of civil society. It\r\n\r\never has been and ever will be pursued until it be obtained, or\r\n\r\nuntil liberty be lost in the pursuit. In a society under the\r\n\r\nforms of which the stronger faction can readily unite and oppress\r\n\r\nthe weaker, anarchy may as truly be said to reign as in a state\r\n\r\nof nature, where the weaker individual is not secured against the\r\n\r\nviolence of the stronger; and as, in the latter state, even the\r\n\r\nstronger individuals are prompted, by the uncertainty of their\r\n\r\ncondition, to submit to a government which may protect the weak\r\n\r\nas well as themselves; so, in the former state, will the more\r\n\r\npowerful factions or parties be gradually induced, by a like\r\n\r\nmotive, to wish for a government which will protect all parties,\r\n\r\nthe weaker as well as the more powerful. It can be little\r\n\r\ndoubted that if the State of Rhode Island was separated from the\r\n\r\nConfederacy and left to itself, the insecurity of rights under\r\n\r\nthe popular form of government within such narrow limits would be\r\n\r\ndisplayed by such reiterated oppressions of factious majorities\r\n\r\nthat some power altogether independent of the people would soon\r\n\r\nbe called for by the voice of the very factions whose misrule had\r\n\r\nproved the necessity of it. In the extended republic of the\r\n\r\nUnited States, and among the great variety of interests, parties,\r\n\r\nand sects which it embraces, a coalition of a majority of the\r\n\r\nwhole society could seldom take place on any other principles\r\n\r\nthan those of justice and the general good; whilst there being\r\n\r\nthus less danger to a minor from the will of a major party, there\r\n\r\nmust be less pretext, also, to provide for the security of the\r\n\r\nformer, by introducing into the government a will not dependent\r\n\r\non the latter, or, in other words, a will independent of the\r\n\r\nsociety itself. It is no less certain than it is important,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding the contrary opinions which have been\r\n\r\nentertained, that the larger the society, provided it lie within\r\n\r\na practical sphere, the more duly capable it will be of\r\n\r\nself-government. And happily for the REPUBLICAN CAUSE, the\r\n\r\npracticable sphere may be carried to a very great extent, by a\r\n\r\njudicious modification and mixture of the FEDERAL PRINCIPLE.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 52\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Friday, February 8, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON OR MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nFROM the more general inquiries pursued in the four last papers,\r\n\r\nI pass on to a more particular examination of the several parts\r\n\r\nof the government. I shall begin with the House of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives. The first view to be taken of this part of the\r\n\r\ngovernment relates to the qualifications of the electors and the\r\n\r\nelected. Those of the former are to be the same with those of the\r\n\r\nelectors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures.\r\n\r\nThe definition of the right of suffrage is very justly regarded\r\n\r\nas a fundamental article of republican government. It was\r\n\r\nincumbent on the convention, therefore, to define and establish\r\n\r\nthis right in the Constitution. To have left it open for the\r\n\r\noccasional regulation of the Congress, would have been improper\r\n\r\nfor the reason just mentioned. To have submitted it to the\r\n\r\nlegislative discretion of the States, would have been improper\r\n\r\nfor the same reason; and for the additional reason that it would\r\n\r\nhave rendered too dependent on the State governments that branch\r\n\r\nof the federal government which ought to be dependent on the\r\n\r\npeople alone. To have reduced the different qualifications in the\r\n\r\ndifferent States to one uniform rule, would probably have been as\r\n\r\ndissatisfactory to some of the States as it would have been\r\n\r\ndifficult to the convention. The provision made by the convention\r\n\r\nappears, therefore, to be the best that lay within their option.\r\n\r\nIt must be satisfactory to every State, because it is conformable\r\n\r\nto the standard already established, or which may be established,\r\n\r\nby the State itself. It will be safe to the United States,\r\n\r\nbecause, being fixed by the State constitutions, it is not\r\n\r\nalterable by the State governments, and it cannot be feared that\r\n\r\nthe people of the States will alter this part of their\r\n\r\nconstitutions in such a manner as to abridge the rights secured\r\n\r\nto them by the federal Constitution. The qualifications of the\r\n\r\nelected, being less carefully and properly defined by the State\r\n\r\nconstitutions, and being at the same time more susceptible of\r\n\r\nuniformity, have been very properly considered and regulated by\r\n\r\nthe convention. A representative of the United States must be of\r\n\r\nthe age of twenty-five years; must have been seven years a\r\n\r\ncitizen of the United States; must, at the time of his election,\r\n\r\nbe an inhabitant of the State he is to represent; and, during the\r\n\r\ntime of his service, must be in no office under the United\r\n\r\nStates. Under these reasonable limitations, the door of this part\r\n\r\nof the federal government is open to merit of every description,\r\n\r\nwhether native or adoptive, whether young or old, and without\r\n\r\nregard to poverty or wealth, or to any particular profession of\r\n\r\nreligious faith. The term for which the representatives are to be\r\n\r\nelected falls under a second view which may be taken of this\r\n\r\nbranch. In order to decide on the propriety of this article, two\r\n\r\nquestions must be considered: first, whether biennial elections\r\n\r\nwill, in this case, be safe; secondly, whether they be necessary\r\n\r\nor useful. First. As it is essential to liberty that the\r\n\r\ngovernment in general should have a common interest with the\r\n\r\npeople, so it is particularly essential that the branch of it\r\n\r\nunder consideration should have an immediate dependence on, and\r\n\r\nan intimate sympathy with, the people. Frequent elections are\r\n\r\nunquestionably the only policy by which this dependence and\r\n\r\nsympathy can be effectually secured. But what particular degree\r\n\r\nof frequency may be absolutely necessary for the purpose, does\r\n\r\nnot appear to be susceptible of any precise calculation, and must\r\n\r\ndepend on a variety of circumstances with which it may be\r\n\r\nconnected. Let us consult experience, the guide that ought always\r\n\r\nto be followed whenever it can be found. The scheme of\r\n\r\nrepresentation, as a substitute for a meeting of the citizens in\r\n\r\nperson, being at most but very imperfectly known to ancient\r\n\r\npolity, it is in more modern times only that we are to expect\r\n\r\ninstructive examples. And even here, in order to avoid a research\r\n\r\ntoo vague and diffusive, it will be proper to confine ourselves\r\n\r\nto the few examples which are best known, and which bear the\r\n\r\ngreatest analogy to our particular case. The first to which this\r\n\r\ncharacter ought to be applied, is the House of Commons in Great\r\n\r\nBritain. The history of this branch of the English Constitution,\r\n\r\nanterior to the date of Magna Charta, is too obscure to yield\r\n\r\ninstruction. The very existence of it has been made a question\r\n\r\namong political antiquaries. The earliest records of subsequent\r\n\r\ndate prove that parliaments were to SIT only every year; not that\r\n\r\nthey were to be ELECTED every year. And even these annual\r\n\r\nsessions were left so much at the discretion of the monarch,\r\n\r\nthat, under various pretexts, very long and dangerous\r\n\r\nintermissions were often contrived by royal ambition. To remedy\r\n\r\nthis grievance, it was provided by a statute in the reign of\r\n\r\nCharles II. , that the intermissions should not be protracted\r\n\r\nbeyond a period of three years. On the accession of William III.,\r\n\r\nwhen a revolution took place in the government, the subject was\r\n\r\nstill more seriously resumed, and it was declared to be among the\r\n\r\nfundamental rights of the people that parliaments ought to be\r\n\r\nheld FREQUENTLY. By another statute, which passed a few years\r\n\r\nlater in the same reign, the term \"frequently,\" which had\r\n\r\nalluded to the triennial period settled in the time of Charles\r\n\r\nII., is reduced to a precise meaning, it being expressly enacted\r\n\r\nthat a new parliament shall be called within three years after\r\n\r\nthe termination of the former. The last change, from three to\r\n\r\nseven years, is well known to have been introduced pretty early\r\n\r\nin the present century, under on alarm for the Hanoverian\r\n\r\nsuccession. From these facts it appears that the greatest\r\n\r\nfrequency of elections which has been deemed necessary in that\r\n\r\nkingdom, for binding the representatives to their constituents,\r\n\r\ndoes not exceed a triennial return of them. And if we may argue\r\n\r\nfrom the degree of liberty retained even under septennial\r\n\r\nelections, and all the other vicious ingredients in the\r\n\r\nparliamentary constitution, we cannot doubt that a reduction of\r\n\r\nthe period from seven to three years, with the other necessary\r\n\r\nreforms, would so far extend the influence of the people over\r\n\r\ntheir representatives as to satisfy us that biennial elections,\r\n\r\nunder the federal system, cannot possibly be dangerous to the\r\n\r\nrequisite dependence of the House of Representatives on their\r\n\r\nconstituents. Elections in Ireland, till of late, were regulated\r\n\r\nentirely by the discretion of the crown, and were seldom\r\n\r\nrepeated, except on the accession of a new prince, or some other\r\n\r\ncontingent event. The parliament which commenced with George II.\r\n\r\nwas continued throughout his whole reign, a period of about\r\n\r\nthirty-five years. The only dependence of the representatives on\r\n\r\nthe people consisted in the right of the latter to supply\r\n\r\noccasional vacancies by the election of new members, and in the\r\n\r\nchance of some event which might produce a general new election.\r\n\r\nThe ability also of the Irish parliament to maintain the rights\r\n\r\nof their constituents, so far as the disposition might exist, was\r\n\r\nextremely shackled by the control of the crown over the subjects\r\n\r\nof their deliberation. Of late these shackles, if I mistake not,\r\n\r\nhave been broken; and octennial parliaments have besides been\r\n\r\nestablished. What effect may be produced by this partial reform,\r\n\r\nmust be left to further experience. The example of Ireland, from\r\n\r\nthis view of it, can throw but little light on the subject. As\r\n\r\nfar as we can draw any conclusion from it, it must be that if the\r\n\r\npeople of that country have been able under all these\r\n\r\ndisadvantages to retain any liberty whatever, the advantage of\r\n\r\nbiennial elections would secure to them every degree of liberty,\r\n\r\nwhich might depend on a due connection between their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives and themselves. Let us bring our inquiries nearer\r\n\r\nhome. The example of these States, when British colonies, claims\r\n\r\nparticular attention, at the same time that it is so well known\r\n\r\nas to require little to be said on it. The principle of\r\n\r\nrepresentation, in one branch of the legislature at least, was\r\n\r\nestablished in all of them. But the periods of election were\r\n\r\ndifferent. They varied from one to seven years. Have we any\r\n\r\nreason to infer, from the spirit and conduct of the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the people, prior to the Revolution, that\r\n\r\nbiennial elections would have been dangerous to the public\r\n\r\nliberties? The spirit which everywhere displayed itself at the\r\n\r\ncommencement of the struggle, and which vanquished the obstacles\r\n\r\nto independence, is the best of proofs that a sufficient portion\r\n\r\nof liberty had been everywhere enjoyed to inspire both a sense of\r\n\r\nits worth and a zeal for its proper enlargement This remark holds\r\n\r\ngood, as well with regard to the then colonies whose elections\r\n\r\nwere least frequent, as to those whose elections were most\r\n\r\nfrequent Virginia was the colony which stood first in resisting\r\n\r\nthe parliamentary usurpations of Great Britain; it was the first\r\n\r\nalso in espousing, by public act, the resolution of independence.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia, nevertheless, if I have not been misinformed,\r\n\r\nelections under the former government were septennial. This\r\n\r\nparticular example is brought into view, not as a proof of any\r\n\r\npeculiar merit, for the priority in those instances was probably\r\n\r\naccidental; and still less of any advantage in SEPTENNIAL\r\n\r\nelections, for when compared with a greater frequency they are\r\n\r\ninadmissible; but merely as a proof, and I conceive it to be a\r\n\r\nvery substantial proof, that the liberties of the people can be\r\n\r\nin no danger from BIENNIAL elections. The conclusion resulting\r\n\r\nfrom these examples will be not a little strengthened by\r\n\r\nrecollecting three circumstances. The first is, that the federal\r\n\r\nlegislature will possess a part only of that supreme legislative\r\n\r\nauthority which is vested completely in the British Parliament;\r\n\r\nand which, with a few exceptions, was exercised by the colonial\r\n\r\nassemblies and the Irish legislature. It is a received and\r\n\r\nwell-founded maxim, that where no other circumstances affect the\r\n\r\ncase, the greater the power is, the shorter ought to be its\r\n\r\nduration; and, conversely, the smaller the power, the more safely\r\n\r\nmay its duration be protracted. In the second place, it has, on\r\n\r\nanother occasion, been shown that the federal legislature will\r\n\r\nnot only be restrained by its dependence on its people, as other\r\n\r\nlegislative bodies are, but that it will be, moreover, watched\r\n\r\nand controlled by the several collateral legislatures, which\r\n\r\nother legislative bodies are not. And in the third place, no\r\n\r\ncomparison can be made between the means that will be possessed\r\n\r\nby the more permanent branches of the federal government for\r\n\r\nseducing, if they should be disposed to seduce, the House of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives from their duty to the people, and the means of\r\n\r\ninfluence over the popular branch possessed by the other branches\r\n\r\nof the government above cited. With less power, therefore, to\r\n\r\nabuse, the federal representatives can be less tempted on one\r\n\r\nside, and will be doubly watched on the other. PUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 53\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued (The House of Representatives)\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, February 12, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON OR MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nI SHALL here, perhaps, be reminded of a current observation,\r\n\r\n\"that where annual elections end, tyranny begins. \" If it be\r\n\r\ntrue, as has often been remarked, that sayings which become\r\n\r\nproverbial are generally founded in reason, it is not less true,\r\n\r\nthat when once established, they are often applied to cases to\r\n\r\nwhich the reason of them does not extend. I need not look for a\r\n\r\nproof beyond the case before us. What is the reason on which this\r\n\r\nproverbial observation is founded? No man will subject himself to\r\n\r\nthe ridicule of pretending that any natural connection subsists\r\n\r\nbetween the sun or the seasons, and the period within which human\r\n\r\nvirtue can bear the temptations of power. Happily for mankind,\r\n\r\nliberty is not, in this respect, confined to any single point of\r\n\r\ntime; but lies within extremes, which afford sufficient latitude\r\n\r\nfor all the variations which may be required by the various\r\n\r\nsituations and circumstances of civil society. The election of\r\n\r\nmagistrates might be, if it were found expedient, as in some\r\n\r\ninstances it actually has been, daily, weekly, or monthly, as\r\n\r\nwell as annual; and if circumstances may require a deviation from\r\n\r\nthe rule on one side, why not also on the other side? Turning our\r\n\r\nattention to the periods established among ourselves, for the\r\n\r\nelection of the most numerous branches of the State legislatures,\r\n\r\nwe find them by no means coinciding any more in this instance,\r\n\r\nthan in the elections of other civil magistrates. In Connecticut\r\n\r\nand Rhode Island, the periods are half-yearly. In the other\r\n\r\nStates, South Carolina excepted, they are annual. In South\r\n\r\nCarolina they are biennial as is proposed in the federal\r\n\r\ngovernment. Here is a difference, as four to one, between the\r\n\r\nlongest and shortest periods; and yet it would be not easy to\r\n\r\nshow, that Connecticut or Rhode Island is better governed, or\r\n\r\nenjoys a greater share of rational liberty, than South Carolina;\r\n\r\nor that either the one or the other of these States is\r\n\r\ndistinguished in these respects, and by these causes, from the\r\n\r\nStates whose elections are different from both. In searching for\r\n\r\nthe grounds of this doctrine, I can discover but one, and that is\r\n\r\nwholly inapplicable to our case. The important distinction so\r\n\r\nwell understood in America, between a Constitution established by\r\n\r\nthe people and unalterable by the government, and a law\r\n\r\nestablished by the government and alterable by the government,\r\n\r\nseems to have been little understood and less observed in any\r\n\r\nother country. Wherever the supreme power of legislation has\r\n\r\nresided, has been supposed to reside also a full power to change\r\n\r\nthe form of the government. Even in Great Britain, where the\r\n\r\nprinciples of political and civil liberty have been most\r\n\r\ndiscussed, and where we hear most of the rights of the\r\n\r\nConstitution, it is maintained that the authority of the\r\n\r\nParliament is transcendent and uncontrollable, as well with\r\n\r\nregard to the Constitution, as the ordinary objects of\r\n\r\nlegislative provision. They have accordingly, in several\r\n\r\ninstances, actually changed, by legislative acts, some of the\r\n\r\nmost fundamental articles of the government. They have in\r\n\r\nparticular, on several occasions, changed the period of election;\r\n\r\nand, on the last occasion, not only introduced septennial in\r\n\r\nplace of triennial elections, but by the same act, continued\r\n\r\nthemselves in place four years beyond the term for which they\r\n\r\nwere elected by the people. An attention to these dangerous\r\n\r\npractices has produced a very natural alarm in the votaries of\r\n\r\nfree government, of which frequency of elections is the\r\n\r\ncorner-stone; and has led them to seek for some security to\r\n\r\nliberty, against the danger to which it is exposed. Where no\r\n\r\nConstitution, paramount to the government, either existed or\r\n\r\ncould be obtained, no constitutional security, similar to that\r\n\r\nestablished in the United States, was to be attempted. Some\r\n\r\nother security, therefore, was to be sought for; and what better\r\n\r\nsecurity would the case admit, than that of selecting and\r\n\r\nappealing to some simple and familiar portion of time, as a\r\n\r\nstandard for measuring the danger of innovations, for fixing the\r\n\r\nnational sentiment, and for uniting the patriotic exertions? The\r\n\r\nmost simple and familiar portion of time, applicable to the\r\n\r\nsubject was that of a year; and hence the doctrine has been\r\n\r\ninculcated by a laudable zeal, to erect some barrier against the\r\n\r\ngradual innovations of an unlimited government, that the advance\r\n\r\ntowards tyranny was to be calculated by the distance of departure\r\n\r\nfrom the fixed point of annual elections. But what necessity can\r\n\r\nthere be of applying this expedient to a government limited, as\r\n\r\nthe federal government will be, by the authority of a paramount\r\n\r\nConstitution? Or who will pretend that the liberties of the\r\n\r\npeople of America will not be more secure under biennial\r\n\r\nelections, unalterably fixed by such a Constitution, than those\r\n\r\nof any other nation would be, where elections were annual, or\r\n\r\neven more frequent, but subject to alterations by the ordinary\r\n\r\npower of the government? The second question stated is, whether\r\n\r\nbiennial elections be necessary or useful. The propriety of\r\n\r\nanswering this question in the affirmative will appear from\r\n\r\nseveral very obvious considerations.\r\n                                        No man can be a\r\n\r\ncompetent legislator who does not add to an upright intention and\r\n\r\na sound judgment a certain degree of knowledge of the subjects on\r\n\r\nwhich he is to legislate. A part of this knowledge may be\r\n\r\nacquired by means of information which lie within the compass of\r\n\r\nmen in private as well as public stations. Another part can only\r\n\r\nbe attained, or at least thoroughly attained, by actual\r\n\r\nexperience in the station which requires the use of it. The\r\n\r\nperiod of service, ought, therefore, in all such cases, to bear\r\n\r\nsome proportion to the extent of practical knowledge requisite to\r\n\r\nthe due performance of the service. The period of legislative\r\n\r\nservice established in most of the States for the more numerous\r\n\r\nbranch is, as we have seen, one year. The question then may be\r\n\r\nput into this simple form: does the period of two years bear no\r\n\r\ngreater proportion to the knowledge requisite for federal\r\n\r\nlegislation than one year does to the knowledge requisite for\r\n\r\nState legislation? The very statement of the question, in this\r\n\r\nform, suggests the answer that ought to be given to it. In a\r\n\r\nsingle State, the requisite knowledge relates to the existing\r\n\r\nlaws which are uniform throughout the State, and with which all\r\n\r\nthe citizens are more or less conversant; and to the general\r\n\r\naffairs of the State, which lie within a small compass, are not\r\n\r\nvery diversified, and occupy much of the attention and\r\n\r\nconversation of every class of people. The great theatre of the\r\n\r\nUnited States presents a very different scene. The laws are so\r\n\r\nfar from being uniform, that they vary in every State; whilst the\r\n\r\npublic affairs of the Union are spread throughout a very\r\n\r\nextensive region, and are extremely diversified by t e local\r\n\r\naffairs connected with them, and can with difficulty be correctly\r\n\r\nlearnt in any other place than in the central councils to which a\r\n\r\nknowledge of them will be brought by the representatives of every\r\n\r\npart of the empire. Yet some knowledge of the affairs, and even\r\n\r\nof the laws, of all the States, ought to be possessed by the\r\n\r\nmembers from each of the States. How can foreign trade be\r\n\r\nproperly regulated by uniform laws, without some acquaintance\r\n\r\nwith the commerce, the ports, the usages, and the regulatious of\r\n\r\nthe different States? How can the trade between the different\r\n\r\nStates be duly regulated, without some knowledge of their\r\n\r\nrelative situations in these and other respects? How can taxes\r\n\r\nbe judiciously imposed and effectually collected, if they be not\r\n\r\naccommodated to the different laws and local circumstances\r\n\r\nrelating to these objects in the different States? How can\r\n\r\nuniform regulations for the militia be duly provided, without a\r\n\r\nsimilar knowledge of many internal circumstances by which the\r\n\r\nStates are distinguished from each other? These are the\r\n\r\nprincipal objects of federal legislation, and suggest most\r\n\r\nforcibly the extensive information which the representatives\r\n\r\nought to acquire. The other interior objects will require a\r\n\r\nproportional degree of information with regard to them. It is\r\n\r\ntrue that all these difficulties will, by degrees, be very much\r\n\r\ndiminished. The most laborious task will be the proper\r\n\r\ninauguration of the government and the primeval formation of a\r\n\r\nfederal code. Improvements on the first draughts will every year\r\n\r\nbecome both easier and fewer. Past transactions of the\r\n\r\ngovernment will be a ready and accurate source of information to\r\n\r\nnew members. The affairs of the Union will become more and more\r\n\r\nobjects of curiosity and conversation among the citizens at\r\n\r\nlarge. And the increased intercourse among those of different\r\n\r\nStates will contribute not a little to diffuse a mutual knowledge\r\n\r\nof their affairs, as this again will contribute to a general\r\n\r\nassimilation of their manners and laws. But with all these\r\n\r\nabatements, the business of federal legislation must continue so\r\n\r\nfar to exceed, both in novelty and difficulty, the legislative\r\n\r\nbusiness of a single State, as to justify the longer period of\r\n\r\nservice assigned to those who are to transact it. A branch of\r\n\r\nknowledge which belongs to the acquirements of a federal\r\n\r\nrepresentative, and which has not been mentioned is that of\r\n\r\nforeign affairs. In regulating our own commerce he ought to be\r\n\r\nnot only acquainted with the treaties between the United States\r\n\r\nand other nations, but also with the commercial policy and laws\r\n\r\nof other nations. He ought not to be altogether ignorant of the\r\n\r\nlaw of nations; for that, as far as it is a proper object of\r\n\r\nmunicipal legislation, is submitted to the federal government.\r\n\r\nAnd although the House of Representatives is not immediately to\r\n\r\nparticipate in foreign negotiations and arrangements, yet from\r\n\r\nthe necessary connection between the several branches of public\r\n\r\naffairs, those particular branches will frequently deserve\r\n\r\nattention in the ordinary course of legislation, and will\r\n\r\nsometimes demand particular legislative sanction and\r\n\r\nco-operation. Some portion of this knowledge may, no doubt, be\r\n\r\nacquired in a man's closet; but some of it also can only be\r\n\r\nderived from the public sources of information; and all of it\r\n\r\nwill be acquired to best effect by a practical attention to the\r\n\r\nsubject during the period of actual service in the legislature.\r\n\r\nThere are other considerations, of less importance, perhaps, but\r\n\r\nwhich are not unworthy of notice. The distance which many of the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives will be obliged to travel, and the arrangements\r\n\r\nrendered necessary by that circumstance, might be much more\r\n\r\nserious objections with fit men to this service, if limited to a\r\n\r\nsingle year, than if extended to two years. No argument can be\r\n\r\ndrawn on this subject, from the case of the delegates to the\r\n\r\nexisting Congress. They are elected annually, it is true; but\r\n\r\ntheir re-election is considered by the legislative assemblies\r\n\r\nalmost as a matter of course. The election of the representatives\r\n\r\nby the people would not be governed by the same principle. A few\r\n\r\nof the members, as happens in all such assemblies, will possess\r\n\r\nsuperior talents; will, by frequent reelections, become members\r\n\r\nof long standing; will be thoroughly masters of the public\r\n\r\nbusiness, and perhaps not unwilling to avail themselves of those\r\n\r\nadvantages. The greater the proportion of new members, and the\r\n\r\nless the information of the bulk of the members the more apt will\r\n\r\nthey be to fall into the snares that may be laid for them. This\r\n\r\nremark is no less applicable to the relation which will subsist\r\n\r\nbetween the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is an\r\n\r\ninconvenience mingled with the advantages of our frequent\r\n\r\nelections even in single States, where they are large, and hold\r\n\r\nbut one legislative session in a year, that spurious elections\r\n\r\ncannot be investigated and annulled in time for the decision to\r\n\r\nhave its due effect. If a return can be obtained, no matter by\r\n\r\nwhat unlawful means, the irregular member, who takes his seat of\r\n\r\ncourse, is sure of holding it a sufficient time to answer his\r\n\r\npurposes. Hence, a very pernicious encouragement is given to the\r\n\r\nuse of unlawful means, for obtaining irregular returns. Were\r\n\r\nelections for the federal legislature to be annual, this practice\r\n\r\nmight become a very serious abuse, particularly in the more\r\n\r\ndistant States. Each house is, as it necessarily must be, the\r\n\r\njudge of the elections, qualifications, and returns of its\r\n\r\nmembers; and whatever improvements may be suggested by\r\n\r\nexperience, for simplifying and accelerating the process in\r\n\r\ndisputed cases, so great a portion of a year would unavoidably\r\n\r\nelapse, before an illegitimate member could be dispossessed of\r\n\r\nhis seat, that the prospect of such an event would be little\r\n\r\ncheck to unfair and illicit means of obtaining a seat. All these\r\n\r\nconsiderations taken together warrant us in affirming, that\r\n\r\nbiennial elections will be as useful to the affairs of the public\r\n\r\nas we have seen that they will be safe to the liberty of the\r\n\r\npeople. PUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 54\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Apportionment of Members Among the States\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, February 12, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON OR MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTHE next view which I shall take of the House of Representatives\r\n\r\nrelates to the appointment of its members to the several States\r\n\r\nwhich is to be determined by the same rule with that of direct\r\n\r\ntaxes.\r\n          It is not contended that the number of people in each\r\n\r\nState ought not to be the standard for regulating the proportion\r\n\r\nof those who are to represent the people of each State. The\r\n\r\nestablishment of the same rule for the appointment of taxes, will\r\n\r\nprobably be as little contested; though the rule itself in this\r\n\r\ncase, is by no means founded on the same principle. In the former\r\n\r\ncase, the rule is understood to refer to the personal rights of\r\n\r\nthe people, with which it has a natural and universal connection.\r\n\r\nIn the latter, it has reference to the proportion of wealth, of\r\n\r\nwhich it is in no case a precise measure, and in ordinary cases a\r\n\r\nvery unfit one. But notwithstanding the imperfection of the rule\r\n\r\nas applied to the relative wealth and contributions of the\r\n\r\nStates, it is evidently the least objectionable among the\r\n\r\npracticable rules, and had too recently obtained the general\r\n\r\nsanction of America, not to have found a ready preference with\r\n\r\nthe convention. All this is admitted, it will perhaps be said;\r\n\r\nbut does it follow, from an admission of numbers for the measure\r\n\r\nof representation, or of slaves combined with free citizens as a\r\n\r\nratio of taxation, that slaves ought to be included in the\r\n\r\nnumerical rule of representation? Slaves are considered as\r\n\r\nproperty, not as persons. They ought therefore to be comprehended\r\n\r\nin estimates of taxation which are founded on property, and to be\r\n\r\nexcluded from representation which is regulated by a census of\r\n\r\npersons. This is the objection, as I understand it, stated in its\r\n\r\nfull force. I shall be equally candid in stating the reasoning\r\n\r\nwhich may be offered on the opposite side. \"We subscribe to the\r\n\r\ndoctrine,\" might one of our Southern brethren observe, \"that\r\n\r\nrepresentation relates more immediately to persons, and taxation\r\n\r\nmore immediately to property, and we join in the application of\r\n\r\nthis distinction to the case of our slaves. But we must deny the\r\n\r\nfact, that slaves are considered merely as property, and in no\r\n\r\nrespect whatever as persons. The true state of the case is, that\r\n\r\nthey partake of both these qualities: being considered by our\r\n\r\nlaws, in some respects, as persons, and in other respects as\r\n\r\nproperty. In being compelled to labor, not for himself, but for\r\n\r\na master; in being vendible by one master to another master; and\r\n\r\nin being subject at all times to be restrained in his liberty and\r\n\r\nchastised in his body, by the capricious will of another, the\r\n\r\nslave may appear to be degraded from the human rank, and classed\r\n\r\nwith those irrational animals which fall under the legal\r\n\r\ndenomination of property. In being protected, on the other hand,\r\n\r\nin his life and in his limbs, against the violence of all\r\n\r\nothers, even the master of his labor and his liberty; and in\r\n\r\nbeing punishable himself for all violence committed against\r\n\r\nothers, the slave is no less evidently regarded by the law as a\r\n\r\nmember of the society, not as a part of the irrational creation;\r\n\r\nas a moral person, not as a mere article of property. The\r\n\r\nfederal Constitution, therefore, decides with great propriety on\r\n\r\nthe case of our slaves, when it views them in the mixed character\r\n\r\nof persons and of property. This is in fact their true\r\n\r\ncharacter. It is the character bestowed on them by the laws\r\n\r\nunder which they live; and it will not be denied, that these are\r\n\r\nthe proper criterion; because it is only under the pretext that\r\n\r\nthe laws have transformed the negroes into subjects of property,\r\n\r\nthat a place is disputed them in the computation of numbers; and\r\n\r\nit is admitted, that if the laws were to restore the rights which\r\n\r\nhave been taken away, the negroes could no longer be refused an\r\n\r\nequal share of representation with the other inhabitants. \"This\r\n\r\nquestion may be placed in another light. It is agreed on all\r\n\r\nsides, that numbers are the best scale of wealth and taxation, as\r\n\r\nthey are the only proper scale of representation. Would the\r\n\r\nconvention have been impartial or consistent, if they had\r\n\r\nrejected the slaves from the list of inhabitants, when the shares\r\n\r\nof representation were to be calculated, and inserted them on the\r\n\r\nlists when the tariff of contributions was to be adjusted? Could\r\n\r\nit be reasonably expected, that the Southern States would concur\r\n\r\nin a system, which considered their slaves in some degree as men,\r\n\r\nwhen burdens were to be imposed, but refused to consider them in\r\n\r\nthe same light, when advantages were to be conferred? Might not\r\n\r\nsome surprise also be expressed, that those who reproach the\r\n\r\nSouthern States with the barbarous policy of considering as\r\n\r\nproperty a part of their human brethren, should themselves\r\n\r\ncontend, that the government to which all the States are to be\r\n\r\nparties, ought to consider this unfortunate race more completely\r\n\r\nin the unnatural light of property, than the very laws of which\r\n\r\nthey complain? \"It may be replied, perhaps, that slaves are not\r\n\r\nincluded in the estimate of representatives in any of the States\r\n\r\npossessing them. They neither vote themselves nor increase the\r\n\r\nvotes of their masters. Upon what principle, then, ought they to\r\n\r\nbe taken into the federal estimate of representation? In\r\n\r\nrejecting them altogether, the Constitution would, in this\r\n\r\nrespect, have followed the very laws which have been appealed to\r\n\r\nas the proper guide. \"This objection is repelled by a single\r\n\r\nobservation. It is a fundamental principle of the proposed\r\n\r\nConstitution, that as the aggregate number of representatives\r\n\r\nallotted to the several States is to be determined by a federal\r\n\r\nrule, founded on the aggregate number of inhabitants, so the\r\n\r\nright of choosing this allotted number in each State is to be\r\n\r\nexercised by such part of the inhabitants as the State itself may\r\n\r\ndesignate. The qualifications on which the right of suffrage\r\n\r\ndepend are not, perhaps, the same in any two States. In some of\r\n\r\nthe States the difference is very material. In every State, a\r\n\r\ncertain proportion of inhabitants are deprived of this right by\r\n\r\nthe constitution of the State, who will be included in the census\r\n\r\nby which the federal Constitution apportions the representatives.\r\n\r\nIn this point of view the Southern States might retort the\r\n\r\ncomplaint, by insisting that the principle laid down by the\r\n\r\nconvention required that no regard should be had to the policy of\r\n\r\nparticular States towards their own inhabitants; and\r\n\r\nconsequently, that the slaves, as inhabitants, should have been\r\n\r\nadmitted into the census according to their full number, in like\r\n\r\nmanner with other inhabitants, who, by the policy of other\r\n\r\nStates, are not admitted to all the rights of citizens. A\r\n\r\nrigorous adherence, however, to this principle, is waived by\r\n\r\nthose who would be gainers by it. All that they ask is that\r\n\r\nequal moderation be shown on the other side. Let the case of the\r\n\r\nslaves be considered, as it is in truth, a peculiar one. Let the\r\n\r\ncompromising expedient of the Constitution be mutually adopted,\r\n\r\nwhich regards them as inhabitants, but as debased by servitude\r\n\r\nbelow the equal level of free inhabitants, which regards the\r\n\r\nSLAVE as divested of two fifths of the MAN. \"After all, may not\r\n\r\nanother ground be taken on which this article of the\r\n\r\nConstitution will admit of a still more ready defense? We have\r\n\r\nhitherto proceeded on the idea that representation related to\r\n\r\npersons only, and not at all to property. But is it a just idea?\r\n\r\nGovernment is instituted no less for protection of the property,\r\n\r\nthan of the persons, of individuals. The one as well as the\r\n\r\nother, therefore, may be considered as represented by those who\r\n\r\nare charged with the government. Upon this principle it is, that\r\n\r\nin several of the States, and particularly in the State of New\r\n\r\nYork, one branch of the government is intended more especially to\r\n\r\nbe the guardian of property, and is accordingly elected by that\r\n\r\npart of the society which is most interested in this object of\r\n\r\ngovernment. In the federal Constitution, this policy does not\r\n\r\nprevail. The rights of property are committed into the same hands\r\n\r\nwith the personal rights. Some attention ought, therefore, to be\r\n\r\npaid to property in the choice of those hands. \"For another\r\n\r\nreason, the votes allowed in the federal legislature to the\r\n\r\npeople of each State, ought to bear some proportion to the\r\n\r\ncomparative wealth of the States. States have not, like\r\n\r\nindividuals, an influence over each other, arising from superior\r\n\r\nadvantages of fortune. If the law allows an opulent citizen but a\r\n\r\nsingle vote in the choice of his representative, the respect and\r\n\r\nconsequence which he derives from his fortunate situation very\r\n\r\nfrequently guide the votes of others to the objects of his\r\n\r\nchoice; and through this imperceptible channel the rights of\r\n\r\nproperty are conveyed into the public representation. A State\r\n\r\npossesses no such influence over other States. It is not probable\r\n\r\nthat the richest State in the Confederacy will ever influence the\r\n\r\nchoice of a single representative in any other State. Nor will\r\n\r\nthe representatives of the larger and richer States possess any\r\n\r\nother advantage in the federal legislature, over the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of other States, than what may result from their\r\n\r\nsuperior number alone. As far, therefore, as their superior\r\n\r\nwealth and weight may justly entitle them to any advantage, it\r\n\r\nought to be secured to them by a superior share of\r\n\r\nrepresentation. The new Constitution is, in this respect,\r\n\r\nmaterially different from the existing Confederation, as well as\r\n\r\nfrom that of the United Netherlands, and other similar\r\n\r\nconfederacies. In each of the latter, the efficacy of the\r\n\r\nfederal resolutions depends on the subsequent and voluntary\r\n\r\nresolutions of the states composing the union. Hence the states,\r\n\r\nthough possessing an equal vote in the public councils, have an\r\n\r\nunequal influence, corresponding with the unequal importance of\r\n\r\nthese subsequent and voluntary resolutions. Under the proposed\r\n\r\nConstitution, the federal acts will take effect without the\r\n\r\nnecessary intervention of the individual States. They will depend\r\n\r\nmerely on the majority of votes in the federal legislature, and\r\n\r\nconsequently each vote, whether proceeding from a larger or\r\n\r\nsmaller State, or a State more or less wealthy or powerful, will\r\n\r\nhave an equal weight and efficacy: in the same manner as the\r\n\r\nvotes individually given in a State legislature, by the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of unequal counties or other districts, have\r\n\r\neach a precise equality of value and effect; or if there be any\r\n\r\ndifference in the case, it proceeds from the difference in the\r\n\r\npersonal character of the individual representative, rather than\r\n\r\nfrom any regard to the extent of the district from which he\r\n\r\ncomes. \"Such is the reasoning which an advocate for the\r\n\r\nSouthern interests might employ on this subject; and although it\r\n\r\nmay appear to be a little strained in some points, yet, on the\r\n\r\nwhole, I must confess that it fully reconciles me to the scale of\r\n\r\nrepresentation which the convention have established. In one\r\n\r\nrespect, the establishment of a common measure for representation\r\n\r\nand taxation will have a very salutary effect. As the accuracy\r\n\r\nof the census to be obtained by the Congress will necessarily\r\n\r\ndepend, in a considerable degree on the disposition, if not on\r\n\r\nthe co-operation, of the States, it is of great importance that\r\n\r\nthe States should feel as little bias as possible, to swell or to\r\n\r\nreduce the amount of their numbers. Were their share of\r\n\r\nrepresentation alone to be governed by this rule, they would have\r\n\r\nan interest in exaggerating their inhabitants. Were the rule to\r\n\r\ndecide their share of taxation alone, a contrary temptation would\r\n\r\nprevail. By extending the rule to both objects, the States will\r\n\r\nhave opposite interests, which will control and balance each\r\n\r\nother, and produce the requisite impartiality. PUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 55\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Total Number of the House of Representatives\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Friday, February 15, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON OR MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTHE number of which the House of Representatives is to consist,\r\n\r\nforms another and a very interesting point of view, under which\r\n\r\nthis branch of the federal legislature may be contemplated.\r\n\r\nScarce any article, indeed, in the whole Constitution seems to be\r\n\r\nrendered more worthy of attention, by the weight of character and\r\n\r\nthe apparent force of argument with which it has been assailed.\r\n\r\nThe charges exhibited against it are, first, that so small a\r\n\r\nnumber of representatives will be an unsafe depositary of the\r\n\r\npublic interests; secondly, that they will not possess a proper\r\n\r\nknowledge of the local circumstances of their numerous\r\n\r\nconstituents; thirdly, that they will be taken from that class of\r\n\r\ncitizens which will sympathize least with the feelings of the\r\n\r\nmass of the people, and be most likely to aim at a permanent\r\n\r\nelevation of the few on the depression of the many; fourthly,\r\n\r\nthat defective as the number will be in the first instance, it\r\n\r\nwill be more and more disproportionate, by the increase of the\r\n\r\npeople, and the obstacles which will prevent a correspondent\r\n\r\nincrease of the representatives. In general it may be remarked on\r\n\r\nthis subject, that no political problem is less susceptible of a\r\n\r\nprecise solution than that which relates to the number most\r\n\r\nconvenient for a representative legislature; nor is there any\r\n\r\npoint on which the policy of the several States is more at\r\n\r\nvariance, whether we compare their legislative assemblies\r\n\r\ndirectly with each other, or consider the proportions which they\r\n\r\nrespectively bear to the number of their constituents. Passing\r\n\r\nover the difference between the smallest and largest States, as\r\n\r\nDelaware, whose most numerous branch consists of twenty-one\r\n\r\nrepresentatives, and Massachusetts, where it amounts to between\r\n\r\nthree and four hundred, a very considerable difference is\r\n\r\nobservable among States nearly equal in population. The number of\r\n\r\nrepresentatives in Pennsylvania is not more than one fifth of\r\n\r\nthat in the State last mentioned. New York, whose population is\r\n\r\nto that of South Carolina as six to five, has little more than\r\n\r\none third of the number of representatives. As great a disparity\r\n\r\nprevails between the States of Georgia and Delaware or Rhode\r\n\r\nIsland. In Pennsylvania, the representatives do not bear a\r\n\r\ngreater proportion to their constituents than of one for every\r\n\r\nfour or five thousand. In Rhode Island, they bear a proportion of\r\n\r\nat least one for every thousand. And according to the\r\n\r\nconstitution of Georgia, the proportion may be carried to one to\r\n\r\nevery ten electors; and must unavoidably far exceed the\r\n\r\nproportion in any of the other States. Another general remark to\r\n\r\nbe made is, that the ratio between the representatives and the\r\n\r\npeople ought not to be the same where the latter are very\r\n\r\nnumerous as where they are very few. Were the representatives in\r\n\r\nVirginia to be regulated by the standard in Rhode Island, they\r\n\r\nwould, at this time, amount to between four and five hundred; and\r\n\r\ntwenty or thirty years hence, to a thousand. On the other hand,\r\n\r\nthe ratio of Pennsylvania, if applied to the State of Delaware,\r\n\r\nwould reduce the representative assembly of the latter to seven\r\n\r\nor eight members. Nothing can be more fallacious than to found\r\n\r\nour political calculations on arithmetical principles. Sixty or\r\n\r\nseventy men may be more properly trusted with a given degree of\r\n\r\npower than six or seven. But it does not follow that six or seven\r\n\r\nhundred would be proportionably a better depositary. And if we\r\n\r\ncarry on the supposition to six or seven thousand, the whole\r\n\r\nreasoning ought to be reversed. The truth is, that in all cases a\r\n\r\ncertain number at least seems to be necessary to secure the\r\n\r\nbenefits of free consultation and discussion, and to guard\r\n\r\nagainst too easy a combination for improper purposes; as, on the\r\n\r\nother hand, the number ought at most to be kept within a certain\r\n\r\nlimit, in order to avoid the confusion and intemperance of a\r\n\r\nmultitude. In all very numerous assemblies, of whatever character\r\n\r\ncomposed, passion never fails to wrest the sceptre from reason.\r\n\r\nHad every Athenian citizen been a Socrates, every Athenian\r\n\r\nassembly would still have been a mob.\r\n                                         It is necessary also to\r\n\r\nrecollect here the observations which were applied to the case of\r\n\r\nbiennial elections. For the same reason that the limited powers\r\n\r\nof the Congress, and the control of the State legislatures,\r\n\r\njustify less frequent elections than the public safely might\r\n\r\notherwise require, the members of the Congress need be less\r\n\r\nnumerous than if they possessed the whole power of legislation,\r\n\r\nand were under no other than the ordinary restraints of other\r\n\r\nlegislative bodies. With these general ideas in our mind, let us\r\n\r\nweigh the objections which have been stated against the number of\r\n\r\nmembers proposed for the House of Representatives. It is said, in\r\n\r\nthe first place, that so small a number cannot be safely trusted\r\n\r\nwith so much power. The number of which this branch of the\r\n\r\nlegislature is to consist, at the outset of the government, will\r\n\r\nbe sixtyfive. Within three years a census is to be taken, when\r\n\r\nthe number may be augmented to one for every thirty thousand\r\n\r\ninhabitants; and within every successive period of ten years the\r\n\r\ncensus is to be renewed, and augmentations may continue to be\r\n\r\nmade under the above limitation. It will not be thought an\r\n\r\nextravagant conjecture that the first census will, at the rate of\r\n\r\none for every thirty thousand, raise the number of\r\n\r\nrepresentatives to at least one hundred. Estimating the negroes\r\n\r\nin the proportion of three fifths, it can scarcely be doubted\r\n\r\nthat the population of the United States will by that time, if it\r\n\r\ndoes not already, amount to three millions. At the expiration of\r\n\r\ntwenty-five years, according to the computed rate of increase,\r\n\r\nthe number of representatives will amount to two hundred, and of\r\n\r\nfifty years, to four hundred. This is a number which, I presume,\r\n\r\nwill put an end to all fears arising from the smallness of the\r\n\r\nbody. I take for granted here what I shall, in answering the\r\n\r\nfourth objection, hereafter show, that the number of\r\n\r\nrepresentatives will be augmented from time to time in the\r\n\r\nmanner provided by the Constitution. On a contrary supposition, I\r\n\r\nshould admit the objection to have very great weight indeed. The\r\n\r\ntrue question to be decided then is, whether the smallness of the\r\n\r\nnumber, as a temporary regulation, be dangerous to the public\r\n\r\nliberty? Whether sixty-five members for a few years, and a\r\n\r\nhundred or two hundred for a few more, be a safe depositary for a\r\n\r\nlimited and well-guarded power of legislating for the United\r\n\r\nStates? I must own that I could not give a negative answer to\r\n\r\nthis question, without first obliterating every impression which\r\n\r\nI have received with regard to the present genius of the people\r\n\r\nof America, the spirit which actuates the State legislatures, and\r\n\r\nthe principles which are incorporated with the political\r\n\r\ncharacter of every class of citizens I am unable to conceive that\r\n\r\nthe people of America, in their present temper, or under any\r\n\r\ncircumstances which can speedily happen, will choose, and every\r\n\r\nsecond year repeat the choice of, sixty-five or a hundred men who\r\n\r\nwould be disposed to form and pursue a scheme of tyranny or\r\n\r\ntreachery. I am unable to conceive that the State legislatures,\r\n\r\nwhich must feel so many motives to watch, and which possess so\r\n\r\nmany means of counteracting, the federal legislature, would fail\r\n\r\neither to detect or to defeat a conspiracy of the latter against\r\n\r\nthe liberties of their common constituents. I am equally unable\r\n\r\nto conceive that there are at this time, or can be in any short\r\n\r\ntime, in the United States, any sixty-five or a hundred men\r\n\r\ncapable of recommending themselves to the choice of the people at\r\n\r\nlarge, who would either desire or dare, within the short space of\r\n\r\ntwo years, to betray the solemn trust committed to them. What\r\n\r\nchange of circumstances, time, and a fuller population of our\r\n\r\ncountry may produce, requires a prophetic spirit to declare,\r\n\r\nwhich makes no part of my pretensions. But judging from the\r\n\r\ncircumstances now before us, and from the probable state of them\r\n\r\nwithin a moderate period of time, I must pronounce that the\r\n\r\nliberties of America cannot be unsafe in the number of hands\r\n\r\nproposed by the federal Constitution. From what quarter can the\r\n\r\ndanger proceed? Are we afraid of foreign gold? If foreign gold\r\n\r\ncould so easily corrupt our federal rulers and enable them to\r\n\r\nensnare and betray their constituents, how has it happened that\r\n\r\nwe are at this time a free and independent nation? The Congress\r\n\r\nwhich conducted us through the Revolution was a less numerous\r\n\r\nbody than their successors will be; they were not chosen by, nor\r\n\r\nresponsible to, their fellowcitizens at large; though appointed\r\n\r\nfrom year to year, and recallable at pleasure, they were\r\n\r\ngenerally continued for three years, and prior to the\r\n\r\nratification of the federal articles, for a still longer term.\r\n\r\nThey held their consultations always under the veil of secrecy;\r\n\r\nthey had the sole transaction of our affairs with foreign\r\n\r\nnations; through the whole course of the war they had the fate of\r\n\r\ntheir country more in their hands than it is to be hoped will\r\n\r\never be the case with our future representatives; and from the\r\n\r\ngreatness of the prize at stake, and the eagerness of the party\r\n\r\nwhich lost it, it may well be supposed that the use of other\r\n\r\nmeans than force would not have been scrupled. Yet we know by\r\n\r\nhappy experience that the public trust was not betrayed; nor has\r\n\r\nthe purity of our public councils in this particular ever\r\n\r\nsuffered, even from the whispers of calumny. Is the danger\r\n\r\napprehended from the other branches of the federal government?\r\n\r\nBut where are the means to be found by the President, or the\r\n\r\nSenate, or both? Their emoluments of office, it is to be\r\n\r\npresumed, will not, and without a previous corruption of the\r\n\r\nHouse of Representatives cannot, more than suffice for very\r\n\r\ndifferent purposes; their private fortunes, as they must allbe\r\n\r\nAmerican citizens, cannot possibly be sources of danger. The\r\n\r\nonly means, then, which they can possess, will be in the\r\n\r\ndispensation of appointments. Is it here that suspicion rests\r\n\r\nher charge? Sometimes we are told that this fund of corruption\r\n\r\nis to be exhausted by the President in subduing the virtue of the\r\n\r\nSenate. Now, the fidelity of the other House is to be the\r\n\r\nvictim. The improbability of such a mercenary and perfidious\r\n\r\ncombination of the several members of government, standing on as\r\n\r\ndifferent foundations as republican principles will well admit,\r\n\r\nand at the same time accountable to the society over which they\r\n\r\nare placed, ought alone to quiet this apprehension. But,\r\n\r\nfortunately, the Constitution has provided a still further\r\n\r\nsafeguard. The members of the Congress are rendered ineligible\r\n\r\nto any civil offices that may be created, or of which the\r\n\r\nemoluments may be increased, during the term of their election.\r\n\r\nNo offices therefore can be dealt out to the existing members but\r\n\r\nsuch as may become vacant by ordinary casualties: and to suppose\r\n\r\nthat these would be sufficient to purchase the guardians of the\r\n\r\npeople, selected by the people themselves, is to renounce every\r\n\r\nrule by which events ought to be calculated, and to substitute an\r\n\r\nindiscriminate and unbounded jealousy, with which all reasoning\r\n\r\nmust be vain. The sincere friends of liberty, who give\r\n\r\nthemselves up to the extravagancies of this passion, are not\r\n\r\naware of the injury they do their own cause. As there is a\r\n\r\ndegree of depravity in mankind which requires a certain degree of\r\n\r\ncircumspection and distrust, so there are other qualities in\r\n\r\nhuman nature which justify a certain portion of esteem and\r\n\r\nconfidence. Republican government presupposes the existence of\r\n\r\nthese qualities in a higher degree than any other form. Were the\r\n\r\npictures which have been drawn by the political jealousy of some\r\n\r\namong us faithful likenesses of the human character, the\r\n\r\ninference would be, that there is not sufficient virtue among men\r\n\r\nfor self-government; and that nothing less than the chains of\r\n\r\ndespotism can restrain them from destroying and devouring one\r\n\r\nanother. PUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 56\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued (The Total Number of the House of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives)\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, February 19, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON OR MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND charge against the House of Representatives is, that\r\n\r\nit will be too small to possess a due knowledge of the interests\r\n\r\nof its constituents. As this objection evidently proceeds from a\r\n\r\ncomparison of the proposed number of representatives with the\r\n\r\ngreat extent of the United States, the number of their\r\n\r\ninhabitants, and the diversity of their interests, without taking\r\n\r\ninto view at the same time the circumstances which will\r\n\r\ndistinguish the Congress from other legislative bodies, the best\r\n\r\nanswer that can be given to it will be a brief explanation of\r\n\r\nthese peculiarities. It is a sound and important principle that\r\n\r\nthe representative ought to be acquainted with the interests and\r\n\r\ncircumstances of his constituents. But this principle can extend\r\n\r\nno further than to those circumstances and interests to which the\r\n\r\nauthority and care of the representative relate. An ignorance of\r\n\r\na variety of minute and particular objects, which do not lie\r\n\r\nwithin the compass of legislation, is consistent with every\r\n\r\nattribute necessary to a due performance of the legislative\r\n\r\ntrust. In determining the extent of information required in the\r\n\r\nexercise of a particular authority, recourse then must be had to\r\n\r\nthe objects within the purview of that authority. What are to be\r\n\r\nthe objects of federal legislation? Those which are of most\r\n\r\nimportance, and which seem most to require local knowledge, are\r\n\r\ncommerce, taxation, and the militia. A proper regulation of\r\n\r\ncommerce requires much information, as has been elsewhere\r\n\r\nremarked; but as far as this information relates to the laws and\r\n\r\nlocal situation of each individual State, a very few\r\n\r\nrepresentatives would be very sufficient vehicles of it to the\r\n\r\nfederal councils. Taxation will consist, in a great measure, of\r\n\r\nduties which will be involved in the regulation of commerce. So\r\n\r\nfar the preceding remark is applicable to this object. As far as\r\n\r\nit may consist of internal collections, a more diffusive\r\n\r\nknowledge of the circumstances of the State may be necessary. But\r\n\r\nwill not this also be possessed in sufficient degree by a very\r\n\r\nfew intelligent men, diffusively elected within the State? Divide\r\n\r\nthe largest State into ten or twelve districts, and it will be\r\n\r\nfound that there will be no peculiar local interests in either,\r\n\r\nwhich will not be within the knowledge of the representative of\r\n\r\nthe district. Besides this source of information, the laws of the\r\n\r\nState, framed by representatives from every part of it, will be\r\n\r\nalmost of themselves a sufficient guide. In every State there\r\n\r\nhave been made, and must continue to be made, regulations on this\r\n\r\nsubject which will, in many cases, leave little more to be done\r\n\r\nby the federal legislature, than to review the different laws,\r\n\r\nand reduce them in one general act. A skillful individual in his\r\n\r\ncloset with all the local codes before him, might compile a law\r\n\r\non some subjects of taxation for the whole union, without any aid\r\n\r\nfrom oral information, and it may be expected that whenever\r\n\r\ninternal taxes may be necessary, and particularly in cases\r\n\r\nrequiring uniformity throughout the States, the more simple\r\n\r\nobjects will be preferred. To be fully sensible of the facility\r\n\r\nwhich will be given to this branch of federal legislation by the\r\n\r\nassistance of the State codes, we need only suppose for a moment\r\n\r\nthat this or any other State were divided into a number of parts,\r\n\r\neach having and exercising within itself a power of local\r\n\r\nlegislation. Is it not evident that a degree of local information\r\n\r\nand preparatory labor would be found in the several volumes of\r\n\r\ntheir proceedings, which would very much shorten the labors of\r\n\r\nthe general legislature, and render a much smaller number of\r\n\r\nmembers sufficient for it? The federal councils will derive great\r\n\r\nadvantage from another circumstance. The representatives of each\r\n\r\nState will not only bring with them a considerable knowledge of\r\n\r\nits laws, and a local knowledge of their respective districts,\r\n\r\nbut will probably in all cases have been members, and may even at\r\n\r\nthe very time be members, of the State legislature, where all the\r\n\r\nlocal information and interests of the State are assembled, and\r\n\r\nfrom whence they may easily be conveyed by a very few hands into\r\n\r\nthe legislature of the United States. The observations made on\r\n\r\nthe subject of taxation apply with greater force to the case of\r\n\r\nthe militia. For however different the rules of discipline may be\r\n\r\nin different States, they are the same throughout each particular\r\n\r\nState; and depend on circumstances which can differ but little in\r\n\r\ndifferent parts of the same State. The attentive reader will\r\n\r\ndiscern that the reasoning here used, to prove the sufficiency of\r\n\r\na moderate number of representatives, does not in any respect\r\n\r\ncontradict what was urged on another occasion with regard to the\r\n\r\nextensive information which the representatives ought to possess,\r\n\r\nand the time that might be necessary for acquiring it. This\r\n\r\ninformation, so far as it may relate to local objects, is\r\n\r\nrendered necessary and difficult, not by a difference of laws and\r\n\r\nlocal circumstances within a single State, but of those among\r\n\r\ndifferent States. Taking each State by itself, its laws are the\r\n\r\nsame, and its interests but little diversified. A few men,\r\n\r\ntherefore, will possess all the knowledge requisite for a proper\r\n\r\nrepresentation of them. Were the interests and affairs of each\r\n\r\nindividual State perfectly simple and uniform, a knowledge of\r\n\r\nthem in one part would involve a knowledge of them in every\r\n\r\nother, and the whole State might be competently represented by a\r\n\r\nsingle member taken from any part of it. On a comparison of the\r\n\r\ndifferent States together, we find a great dissimilarity in their\r\n\r\nlaws, and in many other circumstances connected with the objects\r\n\r\nof federal legislation, with all of which the federal\r\n\r\nrepresentatives ought to have some acquaintance. Whilst a few\r\n\r\nrepresentatives, therefore, from each State, may bring with them\r\n\r\na due knowledge of their own State, every representative will\r\n\r\nhave much information to acquire concerning all the other States.\r\n\r\nThe changes of time, as was formerly remarked, on the comparative\r\n\r\nsituation of the different States, will have an assimilating\r\n\r\neffect. The effect of time on the internal affairs of the States,\r\n\r\ntaken singly, will be just the contrary. At present some of the\r\n\r\nStates are little more than a society of husbandmen. Few of them\r\n\r\nhave made much progress in those branches of industry which give\r\n\r\na variety and complexity to the affairs of a nation. These,\r\n\r\nhowever, will in all of them be the fruits of a more advanced\r\n\r\npopulation, and will require, on the part of each State, a fuller\r\n\r\nrepresentation. The foresight of the convention has accordingly\r\n\r\ntaken care that the progress of population may be accompanied\r\n\r\nwith a proper increase of the representative branch of the\r\n\r\ngovernment. The experience of Great Britain, which presents to\r\n\r\nmankind so many political lessons, both of the monitory and\r\n\r\nexemplary kind, and which has been frequently consulted in the\r\n\r\ncourse of these inquiries, corroborates the result of the\r\n\r\nreflections which we have just made. The number of inhabitants in\r\n\r\nthe two kingdoms of England and Scotland cannot be stated at less\r\n\r\nthan eight millions. The representatives of these eight millions\r\n\r\nin the House of Commons amount to five hundred and fifty-eight.\r\n\r\nOf this number, one ninth are elected by three hundred and\r\n\r\nsixty-four persons, and one half, by five thousand seven hundred\r\n\r\nand twenty-three persons. 1 It cannot be supposed that the half\r\n\r\nthus elected, and who do not even reside among the people at\r\n\r\nlarge, can add any thing either to the security of the people\r\n\r\nagainst the government, or to the knowledge of their\r\n\r\ncircumstances and interests in the legislative councils. On the\r\n\r\ncontrary, it is notorious, that they are more frequently the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives and instruments of the executive magistrate, than\r\n\r\nthe guardians and advocates of the popular rights. They might\r\n\r\ntherefore, with great propriety, be considered as something more\r\n\r\nthan a mere deduction from the real representatives of the\r\n\r\nnation. We will, however, consider them in this light alone, and\r\n\r\nwill not extend the deduction to a considerable number of\r\n\r\nothers, who do not reside among their constitutents, are very\r\n\r\nfaintly connected with them, and have very little particular\r\n\r\nknowledge of their affairs. With all these concessions, two\r\n\r\nhundred and seventy-nine persons only will be the depository of\r\n\r\nthe safety, interest, and happiness of eight millions that is to\r\n\r\nsay, there will be one representative only to maintain the rights\r\n\r\nand explain the situation OF TWENTY-EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED\r\n\r\nAND SEVENTY constitutents, in an assembly exposed to the whole\r\n\r\nforce of executive influence, and extending its authority to\r\n\r\nevery object of legislation within a nation whose affairs are in\r\n\r\nthe highest degree diversified and complicated. Yet it is very\r\n\r\ncertain, not only that a valuable portion of freedom has been\r\n\r\npreserved under all these circumstances, but that the defects in\r\n\r\nthe British code are chargeable, in a very small proportion, on\r\n\r\nthe ignorance of the legislature concerning the circumstances of\r\n\r\nthe people. Allowing to this case the weight which is due to it,\r\n\r\nand comparing it with that of the House of Representatives as\r\n\r\nabove explained it seems to give the fullest assurance, that a\r\n\r\nrepresentative for every THIRTY THOUSAND INHABITANTS will render\r\n\r\nthe latter both a safe and competent guardian of the interests\r\n\r\nwhich will be confided to it.

Burgh's \"Political\r\n\r\nDisquisitions. \"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 57\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Alleged Tendency of the New Plan to Elevate the Few at the\r\n\r\nExpense of the Many Considered in Connection with Representation\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, February 19, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON OR MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD charge against the House of Representatives is, that it\r\n\r\nwill be taken from that class of citizens which will have least\r\n\r\nsympathy with the mass of the people, and be most likely to aim\r\n\r\nat an ambitious sacrifice of the many to the aggrandizement of\r\n\r\nthe few. Of all the objections which have been framed against the\r\n\r\nfederal Constitution, this is perhaps the most extraordinary.\r\n\r\nWhilst the objection itself is levelled against a pretended\r\n\r\noligarchy, the principle of it strikes at the very root of\r\n\r\nrepublican government. The aim of every political constitution\r\n\r\nis, or ought to be, first to obtain for rulers men who possess\r\n\r\nmost wisdom to discern, and most virtue to pursue, the common\r\n\r\ngood of the society; and in the next place, to take the most\r\n\r\neffectual precautions for keeping them virtuous whilst they\r\n\r\ncontinue to hold their public trust. The elective mode of\r\n\r\nobtaining rulers is the characteristic policy of republican\r\n\r\ngovernment. The means relied on in this form of government for\r\n\r\npreventing their degeneracy are numerous and various. The most\r\n\r\neffectual one, is such a limitation of the term of appointments\r\n\r\nas will maintain a proper responsibility to the people. Let me\r\n\r\nnow ask what circumstance there is in the constitution of the\r\n\r\nHouse of Representatives that violates the principles of\r\n\r\nrepublican government, or favors the elevation of the few on the\r\n\r\nruins of the many? Let me ask whether every circumstance is not,\r\n\r\non the contrary, strictly conformable to these principles, and\r\n\r\nscrupulously impartial to the rights and pretensions of every\r\n\r\nclass and description of citizens? Who are to be the electors of\r\n\r\nthe federal representatives? Not the rich, more than the poor;\r\n\r\nnot the learned, more than the ignorant; not the haughty heirs of\r\n\r\ndistinguished names, more than the humble sons of obscurity and\r\n\r\nunpropitious fortune. The electors are to be the great body of\r\n\r\nthe people of the United States. They are to be the same who\r\n\r\nexercise the right in every State of electing the corresponding\r\n\r\nbranch of the legislature of the State. Who are to be the objects\r\n\r\nof popular choice? Every citizen whose merit may recommend him to\r\n\r\nthe esteem and confidence of his country. No qualification of\r\n\r\nwealth, of birth, of religious faith, or of civil profession is\r\n\r\npermitted to fetter the judgement or disappoint the inclination\r\n\r\nof the people. If we consider the situation of the men on whom\r\n\r\nthe free suffrages of their fellow-citizens may confer the\r\n\r\nrepresentative trust, we shall find it involving every security\r\n\r\nwhich can be devised or desired for their fidelity to their\r\n\r\nconstituents. In the first place, as they will have been\r\n\r\ndistinguished by the preference of their fellow-citizens, we are\r\n\r\nto presume that in general they will be somewhat distinguished\r\n\r\nalso by those qualities which entitle them to it, and which\r\n\r\npromise a sincere and scrupulous regard to the nature of their\r\n\r\nengagements. In the second place, they will enter into the public\r\n\r\nservice under circumstances which cannot fail to produce a\r\n\r\ntemporary affection at least to their constituents. There is in\r\n\r\nevery breast a sensibility to marks of honor, of favor, of\r\n\r\nesteem, and of confidence, which, apart from all considerations\r\n\r\nof interest, is some pledge for grateful and benevolent returns.\r\n\r\nIngratitude is a common topic of declamation against human\r\n\r\nnature; and it must be confessed that instances of it are but too\r\n\r\nfrequent and flagrant, both in public and in private life. But\r\n\r\nthe universal and extreme indignation which it inspires is itself\r\n\r\na proof of the energy and prevalence of the contrary sentiment.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, those ties which bind the representative to\r\n\r\nhis constituents are strengthened by motives of a more selfish\r\n\r\nnature. His pride and vanity attach him to a form of government\r\n\r\nwhich favors his pretensions and gives him a share in its honors\r\n\r\nand distinctions. Whatever hopes or projects might be entertained\r\n\r\nby a few aspiring characters, it must generally happen that a\r\n\r\ngreat proportion of the men deriving their advancement from their\r\n\r\ninfluence with the people, would have more to hope from a\r\n\r\npreservation of the favor, than from innovations in the\r\n\r\ngovernment subversive of the authority of the people. All these\r\n\r\nsecurities, however, would be found very insufficient without the\r\n\r\nrestraint of frequent elections. Hence, in the fourth place, the\r\n\r\nHouse of Representatives is so constituted as to support in the\r\n\r\nmembers an habitual recollection of their dependence on the\r\n\r\npeople. Before the sentiments impressed on their minds by the\r\n\r\nmode of their elevation can be effaced by the exercise of power,\r\n\r\nthey will be compelled to anticipate the moment when their power\r\n\r\nis to cease, when their exercise of it is to be reviewed, and\r\n\r\nwhen they must descend to the level from which they were raised;\r\n\r\nthere forever to remain unless a faithful discharge of their\r\n\r\ntrust shall have established their title to a renewal of it. I\r\n\r\nwill add, as a fifth circumstance in the situation of the House\r\n\r\nof Representatives, restraining them from oppressive measures,\r\n\r\nthat they can make no law which will not have its full operation\r\n\r\non themselves and their friends, as well as on the great mass of\r\n\r\nthe society. This has always been deemed one of the strongest\r\n\r\nbonds by which human policy can connect the rulers and the people\r\n\r\ntogether. It creates between them that communion of interests and\r\n\r\nsympathy of sentiments, of which few governments have furnished\r\n\r\nexamples; but without which every government degenerates into\r\n\r\ntyranny. If it be asked, what is to restrain the House of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives from making legal discriminations in favor of\r\n\r\nthemselves and a particular class of the society? I answer: the\r\n\r\ngenius of the whole system; the nature of just and constitutional\r\n\r\nlaws; and above all, the vigilant and manly spirit which actuates\r\n\r\nthe people of America, a spirit which nourishes freedom, and in\r\n\r\nreturn is nourished by it. If this spirit shall ever be so far\r\n\r\ndebased as to tolerate a law not obligatory on the legislature,\r\n\r\nas well as on the people, the people will be prepared to tolerate\r\n\r\nany thing but liberty. Such will be the relation between the\r\n\r\nHouse of Representatives and their constituents. Duty, gratitude,\r\n\r\ninterest, ambition itself, are the chords by which they will be\r\n\r\nbound to fidelity and sympathy with the great mass of the people.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that these may all be insufficient to control the\r\n\r\ncaprice and wickedness of man. But are they not all that\r\n\r\ngovernment will admit, and that human prudence can devise? Are\r\n\r\nthey not the genuine and the characteristic means by which\r\n\r\nrepublican government provides for the liberty and happiness of\r\n\r\nthe people? Are they not the identical means on which every State\r\n\r\ngovernment in the Union relies for the attainment of these\r\n\r\nimportant ends? What then are we to understand by the objection\r\n\r\nwhich this paper has combated? What are we to say to the men who\r\n\r\nprofess the most flaming zeal for republican government, yet\r\n\r\nboldly impeach the fundamental principle of it; who pretend to be\r\n\r\nchampions for the right and the capacity of the people to choose\r\n\r\ntheir own rulers, yet maintain that they will prefer those only\r\n\r\nwho will immediately and infallibly betray the trust committed to\r\n\r\nthem? Were the objection to be read by one who had not seen the\r\n\r\nmode prescribed by the Constitution for the choice of\r\n\r\nrepresentatives, he could suppose nothing less than that some\r\n\r\nunreasonable qualification of property was annexed to the right\r\n\r\nof suffrage; or that the right of eligibility was limited to\r\n\r\npersons of particular families or fortunes; or at least that the\r\n\r\nmode prescribed by the State constitutions was in some respect or\r\n\r\nother, very grossly departed from. We have seen how far such a\r\n\r\nsupposition would err, as to the two first points. Nor would it,\r\n\r\nin fact, be less erroneous as to the last. The only difference\r\n\r\ndiscoverable between the two cases is, that each representative\r\n\r\nof the United States will be elected by five or six thousand\r\n\r\ncitizens; whilst in the individual States, the election of a\r\n\r\nrepresentative is left to about as many hundreds. Will it be\r\n\r\npretended that this difference is sufficient to justify an\r\n\r\nattachment to the State governments, and an abhorrence to the\r\n\r\nfederal government? If this be the point on which the objection\r\n\r\nturns, it deserves to be examined. Is it supported by REASON?\r\n\r\nThis cannot be said, without maintaining that five or six\r\n\r\nthousand citizens are less capable of choosing a fit\r\n\r\nrepresentative, or more liable to be corrupted by an unfit one,\r\n\r\nthan five or six hundred. Reason, on the contrary, assures us,\r\n\r\nthat as in so great a number a fit representative would be most\r\n\r\nlikely to be found, so the choice would be less likely to be\r\n\r\ndiverted from him by the intrigues of the ambitious or the\r\n\r\nambitious or the bribes of the rich. Is the CONSEQUENCE from\r\n\r\nthis doctrine admissible? If we say that five or six hundred\r\n\r\ncitizens are as many as can jointly exercise their right of\r\n\r\nsuffrage, must we not deprive the people of the immediate choice\r\n\r\nof their public servants, in every instance where the\r\n\r\nadministration of the government does not require as many of them\r\n\r\nas will amount to one for that number of citizens? Is the\r\n\r\ndoctrine warranted by FACTS? It was shown in the last paper, that\r\n\r\nthe real representation in the British House of Commons very\r\n\r\nlittle exceeds the proportion of one for every thirty thousand\r\n\r\ninhabitants. Besides a variety of powerful causes not existing\r\n\r\nhere, and which favor in that country the pretensions of rank and\r\n\r\nwealth, no person is eligible as a representative of a county,\r\n\r\nunless he possess real estate of the clear value of six hundred\r\n\r\npounds sterling per year; nor of a city or borough, unless he\r\n\r\npossess a like estate of half that annual value. To this\r\n\r\nqualification on the part of the county representatives is added\r\n\r\nanother on the part of the county electors, which restrains the\r\n\r\nright of suffrage to persons having a freehold estate of the\r\n\r\nannual value of more than twenty pounds sterling, according to\r\n\r\nthe present rate of money. Notwithstanding these unfavorable\r\n\r\ncircumstances, and notwithstanding some very unequal laws in the\r\n\r\nBritish code, it cannot be said that the representatives of the\r\n\r\nnation have elevated the few on the ruins of the many. But we\r\n\r\nneed not resort to foreign experience on this subject. Our own\r\n\r\nis explicit and decisive. The districts in New Hampshire in\r\n\r\nwhich the senators are chosen immediately by the people, are\r\n\r\nnearly as large as will be necessary for her representatives in\r\n\r\nthe Congress. Those of Massachusetts are larger than will be\r\n\r\nnecessary for that purpose; and those of New York still more so.\r\n\r\nIn the last State the members of Assembly for the cities and\r\n\r\ncounties of New York and Albany are elected by very nearly as\r\n\r\nmany voters as will be entitled to a representative in the\r\n\r\nCongress, calculating on the number of sixty-five representatives\r\n\r\nonly. It makes no difference that in these senatorial districts\r\n\r\nand counties a number of representatives are voted for by each\r\n\r\nelector at the same time. If the same electors at the same time\r\n\r\nare capable of choosing four or five representatives, they cannot\r\n\r\nbe incapable of choosing one. Pennsylvania is an additional\r\n\r\nexample. Some of her counties, which elect her State\r\n\r\nrepresentatives, are almost as large as her districts will be by\r\n\r\nwhich her federal representatives will be elected. The city of\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia is supposed to contain between fifty and sixty\r\n\r\nthousand souls. It will therefore form nearly two districts for\r\n\r\nthe choice of federal representatives. It forms, however, but\r\n\r\none county, in which every elector votes for each of its\r\n\r\nrepresentatives in the State legislature. And what may appear to\r\n\r\nbe still more directly to our purpose, the whole city actually\r\n\r\nelects a SINGLE MEMBER for the executive council. This is the\r\n\r\ncase in all the other counties of the State. Are not these facts\r\n\r\nthe most satisfactory proofs of the fallacy which has been\r\n\r\nemployed against the branch of the federal government under\r\n\r\nconsideration? Has it appeared on trial that the senators of New\r\n\r\nHampshire, Massachusetts, and New York, or the executive council\r\n\r\nof Pennsylvania, or the members of the Assembly in the two last\r\n\r\nStates, have betrayed any peculiar disposition to sacrifice the\r\n\r\nmany to the few, or are in any respect less worthy of their\r\n\r\nplaces than the representatives and magistrates appointed in\r\n\r\nother States by very small divisions of the people? But there are\r\n\r\ncases of a stronger complexion than any which I have yet quoted.\r\n\r\nOne branch of the legislature of Connecticut is so constituted\r\n\r\nthat each member of it is elected by the whole State. So is the\r\n\r\ngovernor of that State, of Massachusetts, and of this State, and\r\n\r\nthe president of New Hampshire. I leave every man to decide\r\n\r\nwhether the result of any one of these experiments can be said to\r\n\r\ncountenance a suspicion, that a diffusive mode of choosing\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the people tends to elevate traitors and to\r\n\r\nundermine the public liberty. PUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 58\r\n\r\nObjection That The Number of Members Will Not Be Augmented as the\r\n\r\nProgress of Population Demands Considered\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADISON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTHE remaining charge against the House of Representatives, which\r\n\r\nI am to examine, is grounded on a supposition that the number of\r\n\r\nmembers will not be augmented from time to time, as the progress\r\n\r\nof population may demand. It has been admitted, that this\r\n\r\nobjection, if well supported, would have great weight. The\r\n\r\nfollowing observations will show that, like most other objections\r\n\r\nagainst the Constitution, it can only proceed from a partial view\r\n\r\nof the subject, or from a jealousy which discolors and disfigures\r\n\r\nevery object which is beheld. 1. Those who urge the objection\r\n\r\nseem not to have recollected that the federal Constitution will\r\n\r\nnot suffer by a comparison with the State constitutions, in the\r\n\r\nsecurity provided for a gradual augmentation of the number of\r\n\r\nrepresentatives. The number which is to prevail in the first\r\n\r\ninstance is declared to be temporary. Its duration is limited to\r\n\r\nthe short term of three years. Within every successive term of\r\n\r\nten years a census of inhabitants is to be repeated. The\r\n\r\nunequivocal objects of these regulations are, first, to readjust,\r\n\r\nfrom time to time, the apportionment of representatives to the\r\n\r\nnumber of inhabitants, under the single exception that each State\r\n\r\nshall have one representative at least; secondly, to augment the\r\n\r\nnumber of representatives at the same periods, under the sole\r\n\r\nlimitation that the whole number shall not exceed one for every\r\n\r\nthirty thousand inhabitants. If we review the constitutions of\r\n\r\nthe several States, we shall find that some of them contain no\r\n\r\ndeterminate regulations on this subject, that others correspond\r\n\r\npretty much on this point with the federal Constitution, and that\r\n\r\nthe most effectual security in any of them is resolvable into a\r\n\r\nmere directory provision. 2. As far as experience has taken place\r\n\r\non this subject, a gradual increase of representatives under the\r\n\r\nState constitutions has at least kept pace with that of the\r\n\r\nconstituents, and it appears that the former have been as ready\r\n\r\nto concur in such measures as the latter have been to call for\r\n\r\nthem. 3. There is a peculiarity in the federal Constitution which\r\n\r\ninsures a watchful attention in a majority both of the people and\r\n\r\nof their representatives to a constitutional augmentation of the\r\n\r\nlatter. The peculiarity lies in this, that one branch of the\r\n\r\nlegislature is a representation of citizens, the other of the\r\n\r\nStates: in the former, consequently, the larger States will have\r\n\r\nmost weight; in the latter, the advantage will be in favor of the\r\n\r\nsmaller States. From this circumstance it may with certainty be\r\n\r\ninferred that the larger States will be strenuous advocates for\r\n\r\nincreasing the number and weight of that part of the legislature\r\n\r\nin which their influence predominates. And it so happens that\r\n\r\nfour only of the largest will have a majority of the whole votes\r\n\r\nin the House of Representatives. Should the representatives or\r\n\r\npeople, therefore, of the smaller States oppose at any time a\r\n\r\nreasonable addition of members, a coalition of a very few States\r\n\r\nwill be sufficient to overrule the opposition; a coalition which,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding the rivalship and local prejudices which might\r\n\r\nprevent it on ordinary occasions, would not fail to take place,\r\n\r\nwhen not merely prompted by common interest, but justified by\r\n\r\nequity and the principles of the Constitution. It may be\r\n\r\nalleged, perhaps, that the Senate would be prompted by like\r\n\r\nmotives to an adverse coalition; and as their concurrence would\r\n\r\nbe indispensable, the just and constitutional views of the other\r\n\r\nbranch might be defeated. This is the difficulty which has\r\n\r\nprobably created the most serious apprehensions in the jealous\r\n\r\nfriends of a numerous representation. Fortunately it is among\r\n\r\nthe difficulties which, existing only in appearance, vanish on a\r\n\r\nclose and accurate inspection. The following reflections will,\r\n\r\nif I mistake not, be admitted to be conclusive and satisfactory\r\n\r\non this point. Notwithstanding the equal authority which will\r\n\r\nsubsist between the two houses on all legislative subjects,\r\n\r\nexcept the originating of money bills, it cannot be doubted that\r\n\r\nthe House, composed of the greater number of members, when\r\n\r\nsupported by the more powerful States, and speaking the known and\r\n\r\ndetermined sense of a majority of the people, will have no small\r\n\r\nadvantage in a question depending on the comparative firmness of\r\n\r\nthe two houses. This advantage must be increased by the\r\n\r\nconsciousness, felt by the same side of being supported in its\r\n\r\ndemands by right, by reason, and by the Constitution; and the\r\n\r\nconsciousness, on the opposite side, of contending against the\r\n\r\nforce of all these solemn considerations. It is farther to be\r\n\r\nconsidered, that in the gradation between the smallest and\r\n\r\nlargest States, there are several, which, though most likely in\r\n\r\ngeneral to arrange themselves among the former are too little\r\n\r\nremoved in extent and population from the latter, to second an\r\n\r\nopposition to their just and legitimate pretensions. Hence it is\r\n\r\nby no means certain that a majority of votes, even in the\r\n\r\nSenate, would be unfriendly to proper augmentations in the number\r\n\r\nof representatives. It will not be looking too far to add, that\r\n\r\nthe senators from all the new States may be gained over to the\r\n\r\njust views of the House of Representatives, by an expedient too\r\n\r\nobvious to be overlooked. As these States will, for a great\r\n\r\nlength of time, advance in population with peculiar rapidity,\r\n\r\nthey will be interested in frequent reapportionments of the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives to the number of inhabitants. The large States,\r\n\r\ntherefore, who will prevail in the House of Representatives, will\r\n\r\nhave nothing to do but to make reapportionments and augmentations\r\n\r\nmutually conditions of each other; and the senators from all the\r\n\r\nmost growing States will be bound to contend for the latter, by\r\n\r\nthe interest which their States will feel in the former. These\r\n\r\nconsiderations seem to afford ample security on this subject, and\r\n\r\nought alone to satisfy all the doubts and fears which have been\r\n\r\nindulged with regard to it. Admitting, however, that they should\r\n\r\nall be insufficient to subdue the unjust policy of the smaller\r\n\r\nStates, or their predominant influence in the councils of the\r\n\r\nSenate, a constitutional and infallible resource still remains\r\n\r\nwith the larger States, by which they will be able at all times\r\n\r\nto accomplish their just purposes. The House of Representatives\r\n\r\ncannot only refuse, but they alone can propose, the supplies\r\n\r\nrequisite for the support of government. They, in a word, hold\r\n\r\nthe purse that powerful instrument by which we behold, in the\r\n\r\nhistory of the British Constitution, an infant and humble\r\n\r\nrepresentation of the people gradually enlarging the sphere of\r\n\r\nits activity and importance, and finally reducing, as far as it\r\n\r\nseems to have wished, all the overgrown prerogatives of the other\r\n\r\nbranches of the government. This power over the purse may, in\r\n\r\nfact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with\r\n\r\nwhich any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of\r\n\r\nthe people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for\r\n\r\ncarrying into effect every just and salutary measure. But will\r\n\r\nnot the House of Representatives be as much interested as the\r\n\r\nSenate in maintaining the government in its proper functions, and\r\n\r\nwill they not therefore be unwilling to stake its existence or\r\n\r\nits reputation on the pliancy of the Senate? Or, if such a trial\r\n\r\nof firmness between the two branches were hazarded, would not the\r\n\r\none be as likely first to yield as the other? These questions\r\n\r\nwill create no difficulty with those who reflect that in all\r\n\r\ncases the smaller the number, and the more permanent and\r\n\r\nconspicuous the station, of men in power, the stronger must be\r\n\r\nthe interest which they will individually feel in whatever\r\n\r\nconcerns the government. Those who represent the dignity of their\r\n\r\ncountry in the eyes of other nations, will be particularly\r\n\r\nsensible to every prospect of public danger, or of dishonorable\r\n\r\nstagnation in public affairs. To those causes we are to ascribe\r\n\r\nthe continual triumph of the British House of Commons over the\r\n\r\nother branches of the government, whenever the engine of a money\r\n\r\nbill has been employed. An absolute inflexibility on the side of\r\n\r\nthe latter, although it could not have failed to involve every\r\n\r\ndepartment of the state in the general confusion, has neither\r\n\r\nbeen apprehended nor experienced. The utmost degree of firmness\r\n\r\nthat can be displayed by the federal Senate or President, will\r\n\r\nnot be more than equal to a resistance in which they will be\r\n\r\nsupported by constitutional and patriotic principles. In this\r\n\r\nreview of the Constitution of the House of Representatives, I\r\n\r\nhave passed over the circumstances of economy, which, in the\r\n\r\npresent state of affairs, might have had some effect in lessening\r\n\r\nthe temporary number of representatives, and a disregard of which\r\n\r\nwould probably have been as rich a theme of declamation against\r\n\r\nthe Constitution as has been shown by the smallness of the number\r\n\r\nproposed. I omit also any remarks on the difficulty which might\r\n\r\nbe found, under present circumstances, in engaging in the federal\r\n\r\nservice a large number of such characters as the people will\r\n\r\nprobably elect. One observation, however, I must be permitted to\r\n\r\nadd on this subject as claiming, in my judgment, a very serious\r\n\r\nattention. It is, that in all legislative assemblies the greater\r\n\r\nthe number composing them may be, the fewer will be the men who\r\n\r\nwill in fact direct their proceedings. In the first place, the\r\n\r\nmore numerous an assembly may be, of whatever characters\r\n\r\ncomposed, the greater is known to be the ascendency of passion\r\n\r\nover reason. In the next place, the larger the number, the\r\n\r\ngreater will be the proportion of members of limited information\r\n\r\nand of weak capacities. Now, it is precisely on characters of\r\n\r\nthis description that the eloquence and address of the few are\r\n\r\nknown to act with all their force. In the ancient republics,\r\n\r\nwhere the whole body of the people assembled in person, a single\r\n\r\norator, or an artful statesman, was generally seen to rule with\r\n\r\nas complete a sway as if a sceptre had been placed in his single\r\n\r\nhand. On the same principle, the more multitudinous a\r\n\r\nrepresentative assembly may be rendered, the more it will partake\r\n\r\nof the infirmities incident to collective meetings of the people.\r\n\r\nIgnorance will be the dupe of cunning, and passion the slave of\r\n\r\nsophistry and declamation. The people can never err more than in\r\n\r\nsupposing that by multiplying their representatives beyond a\r\n\r\ncertain limit, they strengthen the barrier against the government\r\n\r\nof a few. Experience will forever admonish them that, on the\r\n\r\ncontrary, AFTER SECURING A SUFFICIENT NUMBER FOR THE PURPOSES OF\r\n\r\nSAFETY, OF LOCAL INFORMATION, AND OF DIFFUSIVE SYMPATHY WITH THE\r\n\r\nWHOLE SOCIETY, they will counteract their own views by every\r\n\r\naddition to their representatives. The countenance of the\r\n\r\ngovernment may become more democratic, but the soul that animates\r\n\r\nit will be more oligarchic. The machine will be enlarged, but the\r\n\r\nfewer, and often the more secret, will be the springs by which\r\n\r\nits motions are directed. As connected with the objection against\r\n\r\nthe number of representatives, may properly be here noticed, that\r\n\r\nwhich has been suggested against the number made competent for\r\n\r\nlegislative business. It has been said that more than a majority\r\n\r\nought to have been required for a quorum; and in particular\r\n\r\ncases, if not in all, more than a majority of a quorum for a\r\n\r\ndecision. That some advantages might have resulted from such a\r\n\r\nprecaution, cannot be denied. It might have been an additional\r\n\r\nshield to some particular interests, and another obstacle\r\n\r\ngenerally to hasty and partial measures. But these considerations\r\n\r\nare outweighed by the inconveniences in the opposite scale. In\r\n\r\nall cases where justice or the general good might require new\r\n\r\nlaws to be passed, or active measures to be pursued, the\r\n\r\nfundamental principle of free government would be reversed. It\r\n\r\nwould be no longer the majority that would rule: the power would\r\n\r\nbe transferred to the minority. Were the defensive privilege\r\n\r\nlimited to particular cases, an interested minority might take\r\n\r\nadvantage of it to screen themselves from equitable sacrifices to\r\n\r\nthe general weal, or, in particular emergencies, to extort\r\n\r\nunreasonable indulgences. Lastly, it would facilitate and foster\r\n\r\nthe baneful practice of secessions; a practice which has shown\r\n\r\nitself even in States where a majority only is required; a\r\n\r\npractice subversive of all the principles of order and regular\r\n\r\ngovernment; a practice which leads more directly to public\r\n\r\nconvulsions, and the ruin of popular governments, than any other\r\n\r\nwhich has yet been displayed among us. PUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 59\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConcerning the Power of Congress to Regulate the Election of\r\n\r\nMembers\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet. Friday, February 22, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTHE natural order of the subject leads us to consider, in this\r\n\r\nplace, that provision of the Constitution which authorizes the\r\n\r\nnational legislature to regulate, in the last resort, the\r\n\r\nelection of its own members. It is in these words: \"The TIMES,\r\n\r\nPLACES, and MANNER of holding elections for senators and\r\n\r\nrepresentatives shall be prescribed in each State by the\r\n\r\nlegislature thereof; but the Congress may, at any time, by law,\r\n\r\nmake or alter SUCH REGULATIONS, except as to the PLACES of\r\n\r\nchoosing senators. \"1 This provision has not only been declaimed\r\n\r\nagainst by those who condemn the Constitution in the gross, but\r\n\r\nit has been censured by those who have objected with less\r\n\r\nlatitude and greater moderation; and, in one instance it has been\r\n\r\nthought exceptionable by a gentleman who has declared himself the\r\n\r\nadvocate of every other part of the system. I am greatly\r\n\r\nmistaken, notwithstanding, if there be any article in the whole\r\n\r\nplan more completely defensible than this. Its propriety rests\r\n\r\nupon the evidence of this plain proposition, that EVERY\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT OUGHT TO CONTAIN IN ITSELF THE MEANS OF ITS OWN\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION. Every just reasoner will, at first sight, approve\r\n\r\nan adherence to this rule, in the work of the convention; and\r\n\r\nwill disapprove every deviation from it which may not appear to\r\n\r\nhave been dictated by the necessity of incorporating into the\r\n\r\nwork some particular ingredient, with which a rigid conformity to\r\n\r\nthe rule was incompatible. Even in this case, though he may\r\n\r\nacquiesce in the necessity, yet he will not cease to regard and\r\n\r\nto regret a departure from so fundamental a principle, as a\r\n\r\nportion of imperfection in the system which may prove the seed of\r\n\r\nfuture weakness, and perhaps anarchy. It will not be alleged,\r\n\r\nthat an election law could have been framed and inserted in the\r\n\r\nConstitution, which would have been always applicable to every\r\n\r\nprobable change in the situation of the country; and it will\r\n\r\ntherefore not be denied, that a discretionary power over\r\n\r\nelections ought to exist somewhere. It will, I presume, be as\r\n\r\nreadily conceded, that there were only three ways in which this\r\n\r\npower could have been reasonably modified and disposed: that it\r\n\r\nmust either have been lodged wholly in the national legislature,\r\n\r\nor wholly in the State legislatures, or primarily in the latter\r\n\r\nand ultimately in the former. The last mode has, with reason,\r\n\r\nbeen preferred by the convention. They have submitted the\r\n\r\nregulation of elections for the federal government, in the first\r\n\r\ninstance, to the local administrations; which, in ordinary\r\n\r\ncases, and when no improper views prevail, may be both more\r\n\r\nconvenient and more satisfactory; but they have reserved to the\r\n\r\nnational authority a right to interpose, whenever extraordinary\r\n\r\ncircumstances might render that interposition necessary to its\r\n\r\nsafety. Nothing can be more evident, than that an exclusive\r\n\r\npower of regulating elections for the national government, in the\r\n\r\nhands of the State legislatures, would leave the existence of the\r\n\r\nUnion entirely at their mercy. They could at any moment\r\n\r\nannihilate it, by neglecting to provide for the choice of persons\r\n\r\nto administer its affairs. It is to little purpose to say, that\r\n\r\na neglect or omission of this kind would not be likely to take\r\n\r\nplace. The constitutional possibility of the thing, without an\r\n\r\nequivalent for the risk, is an unanswerable objection. Nor has\r\n\r\nany satisfactory reason been yet assigned for incurring that\r\n\r\nrisk. The extravagant surmises of a distempered jealousy can\r\n\r\nnever be dignified with that character. If we are in a humor to\r\n\r\npresume abuses of power, it is as fair to presume them on the\r\n\r\npart of the State governments as on the part of the general\r\n\r\ngovernment. And as it is more consonant to the rules of a just\r\n\r\ntheory, to trust the Union with the care of its own existence,\r\n\r\nthan to transfer that care to any other hands, if abuses of power\r\n\r\nare to be hazarded on the one side or on the other, it is more\r\n\r\nrational to hazard them where the power would naturally be\r\n\r\nplaced, than where it would unnaturally be placed. Suppose an\r\n\r\narticle had been introduced into the Constitution, empowering the\r\n\r\nUnited States to regulate the elections for the particular\r\n\r\nStates, would any man have hesitated to condemn it, both as an\r\n\r\nunwarrantable transposition of power, and as a premeditated\r\n\r\nengine for the destruction of the State governments? The\r\n\r\nviolation of principle, in this case, would have required no\r\n\r\ncomment; and, to an unbiased observer, it will not be less\r\n\r\napparent in the project of subjecting the existence of the\r\n\r\nnational government, in a similar respect, to the pleasure of the\r\n\r\nState governments. An impartial view of the matter cannot fail\r\n\r\nto result in a conviction, that each, as far as possible, ought\r\n\r\nto depend on itself for its own preservation. As an objection to\r\n\r\nthis position, it may be remarked that the constitution of the\r\n\r\nnational Senate would involve, in its full extent, the danger\r\n\r\nwhich it is suggested might flow from an exclusive power in the\r\n\r\nState legislatures to regulate the federal elections. It may be\r\n\r\nalleged, that by declining the appointment of Senators, they\r\n\r\nmight at any time give a fatal blow to the Union; and from this\r\n\r\nit may be inferred, that as its existence would be thus rendered\r\n\r\ndependent upon them in so essential a point, there can be no\r\n\r\nobjection to intrusting them with it in the particular case under\r\n\r\nconsideration. The interest of each State, it may be added, to\r\n\r\nmaintain its representation in the national councils, would be a\r\n\r\ncomplete security against an abuse of the trust. This argument,\r\n\r\nthough specious, will not, upon examination, be found solid. It\r\n\r\nis certainly true that the State legislatures, by forbearing the\r\n\r\nappointment of senators, may destroy the national government. But\r\n\r\nit will not follow that, because they have a power to do this in\r\n\r\none instance, they ought to have it in every other. There are\r\n\r\ncases in which the pernicious tendency of such a power may be far\r\n\r\nmore decisive, without any motive equally cogent with that which\r\n\r\nmust have regulated the conduct of the convention in respect to\r\n\r\nthe formation of the Senate, to recommend their admission into\r\n\r\nthe system. So far as that construction may expose the Union to\r\n\r\nthe possibility of injury from the State legislatures, it is an\r\n\r\nevil; but it is an evil which could not have been avoided without\r\n\r\nexcluding the States, in their political capacities, wholly from\r\n\r\na place in the organization of the national government. If this\r\n\r\nhad been done, it would doubtless have been interpreted into an\r\n\r\nentire dereliction of the federal principle; and would certainly\r\n\r\nhave deprived the State governments of that absolute safeguard\r\n\r\nwhich they will enjoy under this provision. But however wise it\r\n\r\nmay have been to have submitted in this instance to an\r\n\r\ninconvenience, for the attainment of a necessary advantage or a\r\n\r\ngreater good, no inference can be drawn from thence to favor an\r\n\r\naccumulation of the evil, where no necessity urges, nor any\r\n\r\ngreater good invites. It may be easily discerned also that the\r\n\r\nnational government would run a much greater risk from a power in\r\n\r\nthe State legislatures over the elections of its House of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives, than from their power of appointing the members\r\n\r\nof its Senate. The senators are to be chosen for the period of\r\n\r\nsix years; there is to be a rotation, by which the seats of a\r\n\r\nthird part of them are to be vacated and replenished every two\r\n\r\nyears; and no State is to be entitled to more than two senators;\r\n\r\na quorum of the body is to consist of sixteen members. The joint\r\n\r\nresult of these circumstances would be, that a temporary\r\n\r\ncombination of a few States to intermit the appointment of\r\n\r\nsenators, could neither annul the existence nor impair the\r\n\r\nactivity of the body; and it is not from a general and permanent\r\n\r\ncombination of the States that we can have any thing to fear. The\r\n\r\nfirst might proceed from sinister designs in the leading members\r\n\r\nof a few of the State legislatures; the last would suppose a\r\n\r\nfixed and rooted disaffection in the great body of the people,\r\n\r\nwhich will either never exist at all, or will, in all\r\n\r\nprobability, proceed from an experience of the inaptitude of the\r\n\r\ngeneral government to the advancement of their happiness in which\r\n\r\nevent no good citizen could desire its continuance. But with\r\n\r\nregard to the federal House of Representatives, there is intended\r\n\r\nto be a general election of members once in two years. If the\r\n\r\nState legislatures were to be invested with an exclusive power of\r\n\r\nregulating these elections, every period of making them would be\r\n\r\na delicate crisis in the national situation, which might issue in\r\n\r\na dissolution of the Union, if the leaders of a few of the most\r\n\r\nimportant States should have entered into a previous conspiracy\r\n\r\nto prevent an election. I shall not deny, that there is a degree\r\n\r\nof weight in the observation, that the interests of each State,\r\n\r\nto be represented in the federal councils, will be a security\r\n\r\nagainst the abuse of a power over its elections in the hands of\r\n\r\nthe State legislatures. But the security will not be considered\r\n\r\nas complete, by those who attend to the force of an obvious\r\n\r\ndistinction between the interest of the people in the public\r\n\r\nfelicity, and the interest of their local rulers in the power and\r\n\r\nconsequence of their offices. The people of America may be\r\n\r\nwarmly attached to the government of the Union, at times when the\r\n\r\nparticular rulers of particular States, stimulated by the natural\r\n\r\nrivalship of power, and by the hopes of personal aggrandizement,\r\n\r\nand supported by a strong faction in each of those States, may be\r\n\r\nin a very opposite temper. This diversity of sentiment between a\r\n\r\nmajority of the people, and the individuals who have the\r\n\r\ngreatest credit in their councils, is exemplified in some of the\r\n\r\nStates at the present moment, on the present question. The\r\n\r\nscheme of separate confederacies, which will always multiply the\r\n\r\nchances of ambition, will be a never failing bait to all such\r\n\r\ninfluential characters in the State administrations as are\r\n\r\ncapable of preferring their own emolument and advancement to the\r\n\r\npublic weal. With so effectual a weapon in their hands as the\r\n\r\nexclusive power of regulating elections for the national\r\n\r\ngovernment, a combination of a few such men, in a few of the most\r\n\r\nconsiderable States, where the temptation will always be the\r\n\r\nstrongest, might accomplish the destruction of the Union, by\r\n\r\nseizing the opportunity of some casual dissatisfaction among the\r\n\r\npeople (and which perhaps they may themselves have excited), to\r\n\r\ndiscontinue the choice of members for the federal House of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives. It ought never to be forgotten, that a firm\r\n\r\nunion of this country, under an efficient government, will\r\n\r\nprobably be an increasing object of jealousy to more than one\r\n\r\nnation of Europe; and that enterprises to subvert it will\r\n\r\nsometimes originate in the intrigues of foreign powers, and will\r\n\r\nseldom fail to be patronized and abetted by some of them. Its\r\n\r\npreservation, therefore ought in no case that can be avoided, to\r\n\r\nbe committed to the guardianship of any but those whose situation\r\n\r\nwill uniformly beget an immediate interest in the faithful and\r\n\r\nvigilant performance of the trust. PUBLIUS. Ist clause, 4th\r\n\r\nsection, of the Ist article.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 60\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued\r\n\r\n(Concerning the Power of Congress to Regulate the Election of\r\nMembers)\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, February 26, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nWE HAVE seen, that an uncontrollable power over the elections to\r\nthe federal government could not, without hazard, be committed to\r\nthe State legislatures. Let us now see, what would be the danger on\r\nthe other side; that is, from confiding the ultimate right of\r\nregulating its own elections to the Union itself. It is not\r\npretended, that this right would ever be used for the exclusion of\r\nany State from its share in the representation. The interest of all\r\nwould, in this respect at least, be the security of all. But it is\r\nalleged, that it might be employed in such a manner as to promote\r\nthe election of some favorite class of men in exclusion of others,\r\nby confining the places of election to particular districts, and\r\nrendering it impracticable to the citizens at large to partake in\r\nthe choice. Of all chimerical suppositions, this seems to be the\r\nmost chimerical. On the one hand, no rational calculation of\r\nprobabilities would lead us to imagine that the disposition which a\r\nconduct so violent and extraordinary would imply, could ever find\r\nits way into the national councils; and on the other, it may be\r\nconcluded with certainty, that if so improper a spirit should ever\r\ngain admittance into them, it would display itself in a form\r\naltogether different and far more decisive.\r\n\r\nThe improbability of the attempt may be satisfactorily inferred\r\nfrom this single reflection, that it could never be made without\r\ncausing an immediate revolt of the great body of the people, headed\r\nand directed by the State governments. It is not difficult to\r\nconceive that this characteristic right of freedom may, in certain\r\nturbulent and factious seasons, be violated, in respect to a\r\nparticular class of citizens, by a victorious and overbearing\r\nmajority; but that so fundamental a privilege, in a country so\r\nsituated and enlightened, should be invaded to the prejudice of the\r\ngreat mass of the people, by the deliberate policy of the\r\ngovernment, without occasioning a popular revolution, is altogether\r\ninconceivable and incredible.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this general reflection, there are considerations\r\nof a more precise nature, which forbid all apprehension on the\r\nsubject. The dissimilarity in the ingredients which will compose\r\nthe national government, and still more in the manner in which they\r\nwill be brought into action in its various branches, must form a\r\npowerful obstacle to a concert of views in any partial scheme of\r\nelections. There is sufficient diversity in the state of property,\r\nin the genius, manners, and habits of the people of the different\r\nparts of the Union, to occasion a material diversity of disposition\r\nin their representatives towards the different ranks and conditions\r\nin society. And though an intimate intercourse under the same\r\ngovernment will promote a gradual assimilation in some of these\r\nrespects, yet there are causes, as well physical as moral, which\r\nmay, in a greater or less degree, permanently nourish different\r\npropensities and inclinations in this respect. But the circumstance\r\nwhich will be likely to have the greatest influence in the matter,\r\nwill be the dissimilar modes of constituting the several component\r\nparts of the government. The House of Representatives being to be\r\nelected immediately by the people, the Senate by the State\r\nlegislatures, the President by electors chosen for that purpose by\r\nthe people, there would be little probability of a common interest\r\nto cement these different branches in a predilection for any\r\nparticular class of electors.\r\n\r\nAs to the Senate, it is impossible that any regulation of \"time\r\nand manner,\" which is all that is proposed to be submitted to the\r\nnational government in respect to that body, can affect the spirit\r\nwhich will direct the choice of its members. The collective sense\r\nof the State legislatures can never be influenced by extraneous\r\ncircumstances of that sort; a consideration which alone ought to\r\nsatisfy us that the discrimination apprehended would never be\r\nattempted. For what inducement could the Senate have to concur in a\r\npreference in which itself would not be included? Or to what\r\npurpose would it be established, in reference to one branch of the\r\nlegislature, if it could not be extended to the other? The\r\ncomposition of the one would in this case counteract that of the\r\nother. And we can never suppose that it would embrace the\r\nappointments to the Senate, unless we can at the same time suppose\r\nthe voluntary co-operation of the State legislatures. If we make\r\nthe latter supposition, it then becomes immaterial where the power\r\nin question is placed whether in their hands or in those of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nBut what is to be the object of this capricious partiality in\r\nthe national councils? Is it to be exercised in a discrimination\r\nbetween the different departments of industry, or between the\r\ndifferent kinds of property, or between the different degrees of\r\nproperty? Will it lean in favor of the landed interest, or the\r\nmoneyed interest, or the mercantile interest, or the manufacturing\r\ninterest? Or, to speak in the fashionable language of the\r\nadversaries to the Constitution, will it court the elevation of\r\n\"the wealthy and the well-born,\" to the exclusion and debasement\r\nof all the rest of the society?\r\n\r\nIf this partiality is to be exerted in favor of those who are\r\nconcerned in any particular description of industry or property, I\r\npresume it will readily be admitted, that the competition for it\r\nwill lie between landed men and merchants. And I scruple not to\r\naffirm, that it is infinitely less likely that either of them should\r\ngain an ascendant in the national councils, than that the one or the\r\nother of them should predominate in all the local councils. The\r\ninference will be, that a conduct tending to give an undue\r\npreference to either is much less to be dreaded from the former than\r\nfrom the latter.\r\n\r\nThe several States are in various degrees addicted to\r\nagriculture and commerce. In most, if not all of them, agriculture\r\nis predominant. In a few of them, however, commerce nearly divides\r\nits empire, and in most of them has a considerable share of\r\ninfluence. In proportion as either prevails, it will be conveyed\r\ninto the national representation; and for the very reason, that\r\nthis will be an emanation from a greater variety of interests, and\r\nin much more various proportions, than are to be found in any single\r\nState, it will be much less apt to espouse either of them with a\r\ndecided partiality, than the representation of any single State.\r\n\r\nIn a country consisting chiefly of the cultivators of land,\r\nwhere the rules of an equal representation obtain, the landed\r\ninterest must, upon the whole, preponderate in the government. As\r\nlong as this interest prevails in most of the State legislatures, so\r\nlong it must maintain a correspondent superiority in the national\r\nSenate, which will generally be a faithful copy of the majorities of\r\nthose assemblies. It cannot therefore be presumed, that a sacrifice\r\nof the landed to the mercantile class will ever be a favorite object\r\nof this branch of the federal legislature. In applying thus\r\nparticularly to the Senate a general observation suggested by the\r\nsituation of the country, I am governed by the consideration, that\r\nthe credulous votaries of State power cannot, upon their own\r\nprinciples, suspect, that the State legislatures would be warped\r\nfrom their duty by any external influence. But in reality the same\r\nsituation must have the same effect, in the primative composition at\r\nleast of the federal House of Representatives: an improper bias\r\ntowards the mercantile class is as little to be expected from this\r\nquarter as from the other.\r\n\r\nIn order, perhaps, to give countenance to the objection at any\r\nrate, it may be asked, is there not danger of an opposite bias in\r\nthe national government, which may dispose it to endeavor to secure\r\na monopoly of the federal administration to the landed class? As\r\nthere is little likelihood that the supposition of such a bias will\r\nhave any terrors for those who would be immediately injured by it, a\r\nlabored answer to this question will be dispensed with. It will be\r\nsufficient to remark, first, that for the reasons elsewhere\r\nassigned, it is less likely that any decided partiality should\r\nprevail in the councils of the Union than in those of any of its\r\nmembers. Secondly, that there would be no temptation to violate the\r\nConstitution in favor of the landed class, because that class would,\r\nin the natural course of things, enjoy as great a preponderancy as\r\nitself could desire. And thirdly, that men accustomed to\r\ninvestigate the sources of public prosperity upon a large scale,\r\nmust be too well convinced of the utility of commerce, to be\r\ninclined to inflict upon it so deep a wound as would result from the\r\nentire exclusion of those who would best understand its interest\r\nfrom a share in the management of them. The importance of commerce,\r\nin the view of revenue alone, must effectually guard it against the\r\nenmity of a body which would be continually importuned in its favor,\r\nby the urgent calls of public necessity.\r\n\r\nI the rather consult brevity in discussing the probability of a\r\npreference founded upon a discrimination between the different kinds\r\nof industry and property, because, as far as I understand the\r\nmeaning of the objectors, they contemplate a discrimination of\r\nanother kind. They appear to have in view, as the objects of the\r\npreference with which they endeavor to alarm us, those whom they\r\ndesignate by the description of \"the wealthy and the well-born.\"\r\nThese, it seems, are to be exalted to an odious pre-eminence over\r\nthe rest of their fellow-citizens. At one time, however, their\r\nelevation is to be a necessary consequence of the smallness of the\r\nrepresentative body; at another time it is to be effected by\r\ndepriving the people at large of the opportunity of exercising their\r\nright of suffrage in the choice of that body.\r\n\r\nBut upon what principle is the discrimination of the places of\r\nelection to be made, in order to answer the purpose of the meditated\r\npreference? Are \"the wealthy and the well-born,\" as they are\r\ncalled, confined to particular spots in the several States? Have\r\nthey, by some miraculous instinct or foresight, set apart in each of\r\nthem a common place of residence? Are they only to be met with in\r\nthe towns or cities? Or are they, on the contrary, scattered over\r\nthe face of the country as avarice or chance may have happened to\r\ncast their own lot or that of their predecessors? If the latter is\r\nthe case, (as every intelligent man knows it to be,1) is it not\r\nevident that the policy of confining the places of election to\r\nparticular districts would be as subversive of its own aim as it\r\nwould be exceptionable on every other account? The truth is, that\r\nthere is no method of securing to the rich the preference\r\napprehended, but by prescribing qualifications of property either\r\nfor those who may elect or be elected. But this forms no part of\r\nthe power to be conferred upon the national government. Its\r\nauthority would be expressly restricted to the regulation of the\r\nTIMES, the PLACES, the MANNER of elections. The qualifications of\r\nthe persons who may choose or be chosen, as has been remarked upon\r\nother occasions, are defined and fixed in the Constitution, and are\r\nunalterable by the legislature.\r\n\r\nLet it, however, be admitted, for argument sake, that the\r\nexpedient suggested might be successful; and let it at the same\r\ntime be equally taken for granted that all the scruples which a\r\nsense of duty or an apprehension of the danger of the experiment\r\nmight inspire, were overcome in the breasts of the national rulers,\r\nstill I imagine it will hardly be pretended that they could ever\r\nhope to carry such an enterprise into execution without the aid of a\r\nmilitary force sufficient to subdue the resistance of the great body\r\nof the people. The improbability of the existence of a force equal\r\nto that object has been discussed and demonstrated in different\r\nparts of these papers; but that the futility of the objection under\r\nconsideration may appear in the strongest light, it shall be\r\nconceded for a moment that such a force might exist, and the\r\nnational government shall be supposed to be in the actual possession\r\nof it. What will be the conclusion? With a disposition to invade\r\nthe essential rights of the community, and with the means of\r\ngratifying that disposition, is it presumable that the persons who\r\nwere actuated by it would amuse themselves in the ridiculous task of\r\nfabricating election laws for securing a preference to a favorite\r\nclass of men? Would they not be likely to prefer a conduct better\r\nadapted to their own immediate aggrandizement? Would they not\r\nrather boldly resolve to perpetuate themselves in office by one\r\ndecisive act of usurpation, than to trust to precarious expedients\r\nwhich, in spite of all the precautions that might accompany them,\r\nmight terminate in the dismission, disgrace, and ruin of their\r\nauthors? Would they not fear that citizens, not less tenacious than\r\nconscious of their rights, would flock from the remote extremes of\r\ntheir respective States to the places of election, to overthrow\r\ntheir tyrants, and to substitute men who would be disposed to avenge\r\nthe violated majesty of the people?\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n1 Particularly in the Southern States and in this State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 61\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued\r\n\r\n(Concerning the Power of Congress to Regulate the Election of\r\nMembers)\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, February 26, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTHE more candid opposers of the provision respecting elections,\r\ncontained in the plan of the convention, when pressed in argument,\r\nwill sometimes concede the propriety of that provision; with this\r\nqualification, however, that it ought to have been accompanied with\r\na declaration, that all elections should be had in the counties\r\nwhere the electors resided. This, say they, was a necessary\r\nprecaution against an abuse of the power. A declaration of this\r\nnature would certainly have been harmless; so far as it would have\r\nhad the effect of quieting apprehensions, it might not have been\r\nundesirable. But it would, in fact, have afforded little or no\r\nadditional security against the danger apprehended; and the want of\r\nit will never be considered, by an impartial and judicious examiner,\r\nas a serious, still less as an insuperable, objection to the plan.\r\nThe different views taken of the subject in the two preceding\r\npapers must be sufficient to satisfy all dispassionate and\r\ndiscerning men, that if the public liberty should ever be the victim\r\nof the ambition of the national rulers, the power under examination,\r\nat least, will be guiltless of the sacrifice.\r\n\r\nIf those who are inclined to consult their jealousy only, would\r\nexercise it in a careful inspection of the several State\r\nconstitutions, they would find little less room for disquietude and\r\nalarm, from the latitude which most of them allow in respect to\r\nelections, than from the latitude which is proposed to be allowed to\r\nthe national government in the same respect. A review of their\r\nsituation, in this particular, would tend greatly to remove any ill\r\nimpressions which may remain in regard to this matter. But as that\r\nview would lead into long and tedious details, I shall content\r\nmyself with the single example of the State in which I write. The\r\nconstitution of New York makes no other provision for LOCALITY of\r\nelections, than that the members of the Assembly shall be elected in\r\nthe COUNTIES; those of the Senate, in the great districts into\r\nwhich the State is or may be divided: these at present are four in\r\nnumber, and comprehend each from two to six counties. It may\r\nreadily be perceived that it would not be more difficult to the\r\nlegislature of New York to defeat the suffrages of the citizens of\r\nNew York, by confining elections to particular places, than for the\r\nlegislature of the United States to defeat the suffrages of the\r\ncitizens of the Union, by the like expedient. Suppose, for\r\ninstance, the city of Albany was to be appointed the sole place of\r\nelection for the county and district of which it is a part, would\r\nnot the inhabitants of that city speedily become the only electors\r\nof the members both of the Senate and Assembly for that county and\r\ndistrict? Can we imagine that the electors who reside in the remote\r\nsubdivisions of the counties of Albany, Saratoga, Cambridge, etc.,\r\nor in any part of the county of Montgomery, would take the trouble\r\nto come to the city of Albany, to give their votes for members of\r\nthe Assembly or Senate, sooner than they would repair to the city of\r\nNew York, to participate in the choice of the members of the federal\r\nHouse of Representatives? The alarming indifference discoverable in\r\nthe exercise of so invaluable a privilege under the existing laws,\r\nwhich afford every facility to it, furnishes a ready answer to this\r\nquestion. And, abstracted from any experience on the subject, we\r\ncan be at no loss to determine, that when the place of election is\r\nat an INCONVENIENT DISTANCE from the elector, the effect upon his\r\nconduct will be the same whether that distance be twenty miles or\r\ntwenty thousand miles. Hence it must appear, that objections to the\r\nparticular modification of the federal power of regulating elections\r\nwill, in substance, apply with equal force to the modification of\r\nthe like power in the constitution of this State; and for this\r\nreason it will be impossible to acquit the one, and to condemn the\r\nother. A similar comparison would lead to the same conclusion in\r\nrespect to the constitutions of most of the other States.\r\n\r\nIf it should be said that defects in the State constitutions\r\nfurnish no apology for those which are to be found in the plan\r\nproposed, I answer, that as the former have never been thought\r\nchargeable with inattention to the security of liberty, where the\r\nimputations thrown on the latter can be shown to be applicable to\r\nthem also, the presumption is that they are rather the cavilling\r\nrefinements of a predetermined opposition, than the well-founded\r\ninferences of a candid research after truth. To those who are\r\ndisposed to consider, as innocent omissions in the State\r\nconstitutions, what they regard as unpardonable blemishes in the\r\nplan of the convention, nothing can be said; or at most, they can\r\nonly be asked to assign some substantial reason why the\r\nrepresentatives of the people in a single State should be more\r\nimpregnable to the lust of power, or other sinister motives, than\r\nthe representatives of the people of the United States? If they\r\ncannot do this, they ought at least to prove to us that it is easier\r\nto subvert the liberties of three millions of people, with the\r\nadvantage of local governments to head their opposition, than of two\r\nhundred thousand people who are destitute of that advantage. And in\r\nrelation to the point immediately under consideration, they ought to\r\nconvince us that it is less probable that a predominant faction in a\r\nsingle State should, in order to maintain its superiority, incline\r\nto a preference of a particular class of electors, than that a\r\nsimilar spirit should take possession of the representatives of\r\nthirteen States, spread over a vast region, and in several respects\r\ndistinguishable from each other by a diversity of local\r\ncircumstances, prejudices, and interests.\r\n\r\nHitherto my observations have only aimed at a vindication of the\r\nprovision in question, on the ground of theoretic propriety, on that\r\nof the danger of placing the power elsewhere, and on that of the\r\nsafety of placing it in the manner proposed. But there remains to\r\nbe mentioned a positive advantage which will result from this\r\ndisposition, and which could not as well have been obtained from any\r\nother: I allude to the circumstance of uniformity in the time of\r\nelections for the federal House of Representatives. It is more than\r\npossible that this uniformity may be found by experience to be of\r\ngreat importance to the public welfare, both as a security against\r\nthe perpetuation of the same spirit in the body, and as a cure for\r\nthe diseases of faction. If each State may choose its own time of\r\nelection, it is possible there may be at least as many different\r\nperiods as there are months in the year. The times of election in\r\nthe several States, as they are now established for local purposes,\r\nvary between extremes as wide as March and November. The\r\nconsequence of this diversity would be that there could never happen\r\na total dissolution or renovation of the body at one time. If an\r\nimproper spirit of any kind should happen to prevail in it, that\r\nspirit would be apt to infuse itself into the new members, as they\r\ncome forward in succession. The mass would be likely to remain\r\nnearly the same, assimilating constantly to itself its gradual\r\naccretions. There is a contagion in example which few men have\r\nsufficient force of mind to resist. I am inclined to think that\r\ntreble the duration in office, with the condition of a total\r\ndissolution of the body at the same time, might be less formidable\r\nto liberty than one third of that duration subject to gradual and\r\nsuccessive alterations.\r\n\r\nUniformity in the time of elections seems not less requisite for\r\nexecuting the idea of a regular rotation in the Senate, and for\r\nconveniently assembling the legislature at a stated period in each\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, Why, then, could not a time have been fixed in\r\nthe Constitution? As the most zealous adversaries of the plan of\r\nthe convention in this State are, in general, not less zealous\r\nadmirers of the constitution of the State, the question may be\r\nretorted, and it may be asked, Why was not a time for the like\r\npurpose fixed in the constitution of this State? No better answer\r\ncan be given than that it was a matter which might safely be\r\nentrusted to legislative discretion; and that if a time had been\r\nappointed, it might, upon experiment, have been found less\r\nconvenient than some other time. The same answer may be given to\r\nthe question put on the other side. And it may be added that the\r\nsupposed danger of a gradual change being merely speculative, it\r\nwould have been hardly advisable upon that speculation to establish,\r\nas a fundamental point, what would deprive several States of the\r\nconvenience of having the elections for their own governments and\r\nfor the national government at the same epochs.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 62\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Senate\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON OR MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nHAVING examined the constitution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and answered such of the objections against it as\r\nseemed to merit notice, I enter next on the examination of the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nThe heads into which this member of the government may be\r\nconsidered are: I. The qualification of senators; II. The\r\nappointment of them by the State legislatures; III. The equality of\r\nrepresentation in the Senate; IV. The number of senators, and the\r\nterm for which they are to be elected; V. The powers vested in the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nI. The qualifications proposed for senators, as distinguished\r\nfrom those of representatives, consist in a more advanced age and a\r\nlonger period of citizenship. A senator must be thirty years of age\r\nat least; as a representative must be twenty-five. And the former\r\nmust have been a citizen nine years; as seven years are required\r\nfor the latter. The propriety of these distinctions is explained by\r\nthe nature of the senatorial trust, which, requiring greater extent\r\nof information and stability of character, requires at the same time\r\nthat the senator should have reached a period of life most likely to\r\nsupply these advantages; and which, participating immediately in\r\ntransactions with foreign nations, ought to be exercised by none who\r\nare not thoroughly weaned from the prepossessions and habits\r\nincident to foreign birth and education. The term of nine years\r\nappears to be a prudent mediocrity between a total exclusion of\r\nadopted citizens, whose merits and talents may claim a share in the\r\npublic confidence, and an indiscriminate and hasty admission of\r\nthem, which might create a channel for foreign influence on the\r\nnational councils.\r\n\r\nII. It is equally unnecessary to dilate on the appointment of\r\nsenators by the State legislatures. Among the various modes which\r\nmight have been devised for constituting this branch of the\r\ngovernment, that which has been proposed by the convention is\r\nprobably the most congenial with the public opinion. It is\r\nrecommended by the double advantage of favoring a select\r\nappointment, and of giving to the State governments such an agency\r\nin the formation of the federal government as must secure the\r\nauthority of the former, and may form a convenient link between the\r\ntwo systems.\r\n\r\nIII. The equality of representation in the Senate is another\r\npoint, which, being evidently the result of compromise between the\r\nopposite pretensions of the large and the small States, does not\r\ncall for much discussion. If indeed it be right, that among a\r\npeople thoroughly incorporated into one nation, every district ought\r\nto have a PROPORTIONAL share in the government, and that among\r\nindependent and sovereign States, bound together by a simple league,\r\nthe parties, however unequal in size, ought to have an EQUAL share\r\nin the common councils, it does not appear to be without some reason\r\nthat in a compound republic, partaking both of the national and\r\nfederal character, the government ought to be founded on a mixture\r\nof the principles of proportional and equal representation. But it\r\nis superfluous to try, by the standard of theory, a part of the\r\nConstitution which is allowed on all hands to be the result, not of\r\ntheory, but \"of a spirit of amity, and that mutual deference and\r\nconcession which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered\r\nindispensable.\" A common government, with powers equal to its\r\nobjects, is called for by the voice, and still more loudly by the\r\npolitical situation, of America. A government founded on principles\r\nmore consonant to the wishes of the larger States, is not likely to\r\nbe obtained from the smaller States. The only option, then, for the\r\nformer, lies between the proposed government and a government still\r\nmore objectionable. Under this alternative, the advice of prudence\r\nmust be to embrace the lesser evil; and, instead of indulging a\r\nfruitless anticipation of the possible mischiefs which may ensue, to\r\ncontemplate rather the advantageous consequences which may qualify\r\nthe sacrifice.\r\n\r\nIn this spirit it may be remarked, that the equal vote allowed\r\nto each State is at once a constitutional recognition of the portion\r\nof sovereignty remaining in the individual States, and an instrument\r\nfor preserving that residuary sovereignty. So far the equality\r\nought to be no less acceptable to the large than to the small\r\nStates; since they are not less solicitous to guard, by every\r\npossible expedient, against an improper consolidation of the States\r\ninto one simple republic.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage accruing from this ingredient in the\r\nconstitution of the Senate is, the additional impediment it must\r\nprove against improper acts of legislation. No law or resolution\r\ncan now be passed without the concurrence, first, of a majority of\r\nthe people, and then, of a majority of the States. It must be\r\nacknowledged that this complicated check on legislation may in some\r\ninstances be injurious as well as beneficial; and that the peculiar\r\ndefense which it involves in favor of the smaller States, would be\r\nmore rational, if any interests common to them, and distinct from\r\nthose of the other States, would otherwise be exposed to peculiar\r\ndanger. But as the larger States will always be able, by their\r\npower over the supplies, to defeat unreasonable exertions of this\r\nprerogative of the lesser States, and as the faculty and excess of\r\nlaw-making seem to be the diseases to which our governments are most\r\nliable, it is not impossible that this part of the Constitution may\r\nbe more convenient in practice than it appears to many in\r\ncontemplation.\r\n\r\nIV. The number of senators, and the duration of their\r\nappointment, come next to be considered. In order to form an\r\naccurate judgment on both of these points, it will be proper to\r\ninquire into the purposes which are to be answered by a senate; and\r\nin order to ascertain these, it will be necessary to review the\r\ninconveniences which a republic must suffer from the want of such an\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nFirst. It is a misfortune incident to republican\r\ngovernment, though in a less degree than to other governments, that\r\nthose who administer it may forget their obligations to their\r\nconstituents, and prove unfaithful to their important trust. In\r\nthis point of view, a senate, as a second branch of the legislative\r\nassembly, distinct from, and dividing the power with, a first, must\r\nbe in all cases a salutary check on the government. It doubles the\r\nsecurity to the people, by requiring the concurrence of two distinct\r\nbodies in schemes of usurpation or perfidy, where the ambition or\r\ncorruption of one would otherwise be sufficient. This is a\r\nprecaution founded on such clear principles, and now so well\r\nunderstood in the United States, that it would be more than\r\nsuperfluous to enlarge on it. I will barely remark, that as the\r\nimprobability of sinister combinations will be in proportion to the\r\ndissimilarity in the genius of the two bodies, it must be politic to\r\ndistinguish them from each other by every circumstance which will\r\nconsist with a due harmony in all proper measures, and with the\r\ngenuine principles of republican government.\r\n\r\nSecondly. The necessity of a senate is not less indicated\r\nby the propensity of all single and numerous assemblies to yield to\r\nthe impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to be seduced by\r\nfactious leaders into intemperate and pernicious resolutions.\r\nExamples on this subject might be cited without number; and from\r\nproceedings within the United States, as well as from the history of\r\nother nations. But a position that will not be contradicted, need\r\nnot be proved. All that need be remarked is, that a body which is\r\nto correct this infirmity ought itself to be free from it, and\r\nconsequently ought to be less numerous. It ought, moreover, to\r\npossess great firmness, and consequently ought to hold its authority\r\nby a tenure of considerable duration.\r\n\r\nThirdly. Another defect to be supplied by a senate lies in\r\na want of due acquaintance with the objects and principles of\r\nlegislation. It is not possible that an assembly of men called for\r\nthe most part from pursuits of a private nature, continued in\r\nappointment for a short time, and led by no permanent motive to\r\ndevote the intervals of public occupation to a study of the laws,\r\nthe affairs, and the comprehensive interests of their country,\r\nshould, if left wholly to themselves, escape a variety of important\r\nerrors in the exercise of their legislative trust. It may be\r\naffirmed, on the best grounds, that no small share of the present\r\nembarrassments of America is to be charged on the blunders of our\r\ngovernments; and that these have proceeded from the heads rather\r\nthan the hearts of most of the authors of them. What indeed are all\r\nthe repealing, explaining, and amending laws, which fill and\r\ndisgrace our voluminous codes, but so many monuments of deficient\r\nwisdom; so many impeachments exhibited by each succeeding against\r\neach preceding session; so many admonitions to the people, of the\r\nvalue of those aids which may be expected from a well-constituted\r\nsenate?\r\n\r\nA good government implies two things: first, fidelity to the\r\nobject of government, which is the happiness of the people;\r\nsecondly, a knowledge of the means by which that object can be best\r\nattained. Some governments are deficient in both these qualities;\r\nmost governments are deficient in the first. I scruple not to\r\nassert, that in American governments too little attention has been\r\npaid to the last. The federal Constitution avoids this error; and\r\nwhat merits particular notice, it provides for the last in a mode\r\nwhich increases the security for the first.\r\n\r\nFourthly. The mutability in the public councils arising\r\nfrom a rapid succession of new members, however qualified they may\r\nbe, points out, in the strongest manner, the necessity of some\r\nstable institution in the government. Every new election in the\r\nStates is found to change one half of the representatives. From\r\nthis change of men must proceed a change of opinions; and from a\r\nchange of opinions, a change of measures. But a continual change\r\neven of good measures is inconsistent with every rule of prudence\r\nand every prospect of success. The remark is verified in private\r\nlife, and becomes more just, as well as more important, in national\r\ntransactions.\r\n\r\nTo trace the mischievous effects of a mutable government would\r\nfill a volume. I will hint a few only, each of which will be\r\nperceived to be a source of innumerable others.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it forfeits the respect and confidence of\r\nother nations, and all the advantages connected with national\r\ncharacter. An individual who is observed to be inconstant to his\r\nplans, or perhaps to carry on his affairs without any plan at all,\r\nis marked at once, by all prudent people, as a speedy victim to his\r\nown unsteadiness and folly. His more friendly neighbors may pity\r\nhim, but all will decline to connect their fortunes with his; and\r\nnot a few will seize the opportunity of making their fortunes out of\r\nhis. One nation is to another what one individual is to another;\r\nwith this melancholy distinction perhaps, that the former, with\r\nfewer of the benevolent emotions than the latter, are under fewer\r\nrestraints also from taking undue advantage from the indiscretions\r\nof each other. Every nation, consequently, whose affairs betray a\r\nwant of wisdom and stability, may calculate on every loss which can\r\nbe sustained from the more systematic policy of their wiser\r\nneighbors. But the best instruction on this subject is unhappily\r\nconveyed to America by the example of her own situation. She finds\r\nthat she is held in no respect by her friends; that she is the\r\nderision of her enemies; and that she is a prey to every nation\r\nwhich has an interest in speculating on her fluctuating councils and\r\nembarrassed affairs.\r\n\r\nThe internal effects of a mutable policy are still more\r\ncalamitous. It poisons the blessing of liberty itself. It will be\r\nof little avail to the people, that the laws are made by men of\r\ntheir own choice, if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be\r\nread, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood; if they be\r\nrepealed or revised before they are promulgated, or undergo such\r\nincessant changes that no man, who knows what the law is to-day, can\r\nguess what it will be to-morrow. Law is defined to be a rule of\r\naction; but how can that be a rule, which is little known, and less\r\nfixed?\r\n\r\nAnother effect of public instability is the unreasonable\r\nadvantage it gives to the sagacious, the enterprising, and the\r\nmoneyed few over the industrious and uniformed mass of the people.\r\nEvery new regulation concerning commerce or revenue, or in any way\r\naffecting the value of the different species of property, presents a\r\nnew harvest to those who watch the change, and can trace its\r\nconsequences; a harvest, reared not by themselves, but by the toils\r\nand cares of the great body of their fellow-citizens. This is a\r\nstate of things in which it may be said with some truth that laws\r\nare made for the FEW, not for the MANY.\r\n\r\nIn another point of view, great injury results from an unstable\r\ngovernment. The want of confidence in the public councils damps\r\nevery useful undertaking, the success and profit of which may depend\r\non a continuance of existing arrangements. What prudent merchant\r\nwill hazard his fortunes in any new branch of commerce when he knows\r\nnot but that his plans may be rendered unlawful before they can be\r\nexecuted? What farmer or manufacturer will lay himself out for the\r\nencouragement given to any particular cultivation or establishment,\r\nwhen he can have no assurance that his preparatory labors and\r\nadvances will not render him a victim to an inconstant government?\r\nIn a word, no great improvement or laudable enterprise can go\r\nforward which requires the auspices of a steady system of national\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nBut the most deplorable effect of all is that diminution of\r\nattachment and reverence which steals into the hearts of the people,\r\ntowards a political system which betrays so many marks of infirmity,\r\nand disappoints so many of their flattering hopes. No government,\r\nany more than an individual, will long be respected without being\r\ntruly respectable; nor be truly respectable, without possessing a\r\ncertain portion of order and stability.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST. No. 63\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Senate Continued\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON OR MADISON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nA FIFTH desideratum, illustrating the utility of a senate, is\r\nthe want of a due sense of national character. Without a select and\r\nstable member of the government, the esteem of foreign powers will\r\nnot only be forfeited by an unenlightened and variable policy,\r\nproceeding from the causes already mentioned, but the national\r\ncouncils will not possess that sensibility to the opinion of the\r\nworld, which is perhaps not less necessary in order to merit, than\r\nit is to obtain, its respect and confidence.\r\n\r\nAn attention to the judgment of other nations is important to\r\nevery government for two reasons: the one is, that, independently\r\nof the merits of any particular plan or measure, it is desirable, on\r\nvarious accounts, that it should appear to other nations as the\r\noffspring of a wise and honorable policy; the second is, that in\r\ndoubtful cases, particularly where the national councils may be\r\nwarped by some strong passion or momentary interest, the presumed or\r\nknown opinion of the impartial world may be the best guide that can\r\nbe followed. What has not America lost by her want of character\r\nwith foreign nations; and how many errors and follies would she not\r\nhave avoided, if the justice and propriety of her measures had, in\r\nevery instance, been previously tried by the light in which they\r\nwould probably appear to the unbiased part of mankind?\r\n\r\nYet however requisite a sense of national character may be, it\r\nis evident that it can never be sufficiently possessed by a numerous\r\nand changeable body. It can only be found in a number so small that\r\na sensible degree of the praise and blame of public measures may be\r\nthe portion of each individual; or in an assembly so durably\r\ninvested with public trust, that the pride and consequence of its\r\nmembers may be sensibly incorporated with the reputation and\r\nprosperity of the community. The half-yearly representatives of\r\nRhode Island would probably have been little affected in their\r\ndeliberations on the iniquitous measures of that State, by arguments\r\ndrawn from the light in which such measures would be viewed by\r\nforeign nations, or even by the sister States; whilst it can\r\nscarcely be doubted that if the concurrence of a select and stable\r\nbody had been necessary, a regard to national character alone would\r\nhave prevented the calamities under which that misguided people is\r\nnow laboring.\r\n\r\nI add, as a SIXTH defect the want, in some important cases, of a\r\ndue responsibility in the government to the people, arising from\r\nthat frequency of elections which in other cases produces this\r\nresponsibility. This remark will, perhaps, appear not only new, but\r\nparadoxical. It must nevertheless be acknowledged, when explained,\r\nto be as undeniable as it is important.\r\n\r\nResponsibility, in order to be reasonable, must be limited to\r\nobjects within the power of the responsible party, and in order to\r\nbe effectual, must relate to operations of that power, of which a\r\nready and proper judgment can be formed by the constituents. The\r\nobjects of government may be divided into two general classes: the\r\none depending on measures which have singly an immediate and\r\nsensible operation; the other depending on a succession of\r\nwell-chosen and well-connected measures, which have a gradual and\r\nperhaps unobserved operation. The importance of the latter\r\ndescription to the collective and permanent welfare of every\r\ncountry, needs no explanation. And yet it is evident that an\r\nassembly elected for so short a term as to be unable to provide more\r\nthan one or two links in a chain of measures, on which the general\r\nwelfare may essentially depend, ought not to be answerable for the\r\nfinal result, any more than a steward or tenant, engaged for one\r\nyear, could be justly made to answer for places or improvements\r\nwhich could not be accomplished in less than half a dozen years.\r\nNor is it possible for the people to estimate the SHARE of\r\ninfluence which their annual assemblies may respectively have on\r\nevents resulting from the mixed transactions of several years. It\r\nis sufficiently difficult to preserve a personal responsibility in\r\nthe members of a NUMEROUS body, for such acts of the body as have an\r\nimmediate, detached, and palpable operation on its constituents.\r\n\r\nThe proper remedy for this defect must be an additional body in\r\nthe legislative department, which, having sufficient permanency to\r\nprovide for such objects as require a continued attention, and a\r\ntrain of measures, may be justly and effectually answerable for the\r\nattainment of those objects.\r\n\r\nThus far I have considered the circumstances which point out the\r\nnecessity of a well-constructed Senate only as they relate to the\r\nrepresentatives of the people. To a people as little blinded by\r\nprejudice or corrupted by flattery as those whom I address, I shall\r\nnot scruple to add, that such an institution may be sometimes\r\nnecessary as a defense to the people against their own temporary\r\nerrors and delusions. As the cool and deliberate sense of the\r\ncommunity ought, in all governments, and actually will, in all free\r\ngovernments, ultimately prevail over the views of its rulers; so\r\nthere are particular moments in public affairs when the people,\r\nstimulated by some irregular passion, or some illicit advantage, or\r\nmisled by the artful misrepresentations of interested men, may call\r\nfor measures which they themselves will afterwards be the most ready\r\nto lament and condemn. In these critical moments, how salutary will\r\nbe the interference of some temperate and respectable body of\r\ncitizens, in order to check the misguided career, and to suspend the\r\nblow meditated by the people against themselves, until reason,\r\njustice, and truth can regain their authority over the public mind?\r\nWhat bitter anguish would not the people of Athens have often\r\nescaped if their government had contained so provident a safeguard\r\nagainst the tyranny of their own passions? Popular liberty might\r\nthen have escaped the indelible reproach of decreeing to the same\r\ncitizens the hemlock on one day and statues on the next.\r\n\r\nIt may be suggested, that a people spread over an extensive\r\nregion cannot, like the crowded inhabitants of a small district, be\r\nsubject to the infection of violent passions, or to the danger of\r\ncombining in pursuit of unjust measures. I am far from denying that\r\nthis is a distinction of peculiar importance. I have, on the\r\ncontrary, endeavored in a former paper to show, that it is one of\r\nthe principal recommendations of a confederated republic. At the\r\nsame time, this advantage ought not to be considered as superseding\r\nthe use of auxiliary precautions. It may even be remarked, that the\r\nsame extended situation, which will exempt the people of America\r\nfrom some of the dangers incident to lesser republics, will expose\r\nthem to the inconveniency of remaining for a longer time under the\r\ninfluence of those misrepresentations which the combined industry of\r\ninterested men may succeed in distributing among them.\r\n\r\nIt adds no small weight to all these considerations, to\r\nrecollect that history informs us of no long-lived republic which\r\nhad not a senate. Sparta, Rome, and Carthage are, in fact, the only\r\nstates to whom that character can be applied. In each of the two\r\nfirst there was a senate for life. The constitution of the senate\r\nin the last is less known. Circumstantial evidence makes it\r\nprobable that it was not different in this particular from the two\r\nothers. It is at least certain, that it had some quality or other\r\nwhich rendered it an anchor against popular fluctuations; and that\r\na smaller council, drawn out of the senate, was appointed not only\r\nfor life, but filled up vacancies itself. These examples, though as\r\nunfit for the imitation, as they are repugnant to the genius, of\r\nAmerica, are, notwithstanding, when compared with the fugitive and\r\nturbulent existence of other ancient republics, very instructive\r\nproofs of the necessity of some institution that will blend\r\nstability with liberty. I am not unaware of the circumstances which\r\ndistinguish the American from other popular governments, as well\r\nancient as modern; and which render extreme circumspection\r\nnecessary, in reasoning from the one case to the other. But after\r\nallowing due weight to this consideration, it may still be\r\nmaintained, that there are many points of similitude which render\r\nthese examples not unworthy of our attention. Many of the defects,\r\nas we have seen, which can only be supplied by a senatorial\r\ninstitution, are common to a numerous assembly frequently elected by\r\nthe people, and to the people themselves. There are others peculiar\r\nto the former, which require the control of such an institution.\r\nThe people can never wilfully betray their own interests; but they\r\nmay possibly be betrayed by the representatives of the people; and\r\nthe danger will be evidently greater where the whole legislative\r\ntrust is lodged in the hands of one body of men, than where the\r\nconcurrence of separate and dissimilar bodies is required in every\r\npublic act.\r\n\r\nThe difference most relied on, between the American and other\r\nrepublics, consists in the principle of representation; which is\r\nthe pivot on which the former move, and which is supposed to have\r\nbeen unknown to the latter, or at least to the ancient part of them.\r\nThe use which has been made of this difference, in reasonings\r\ncontained in former papers, will have shown that I am disposed\r\nneither to deny its existence nor to undervalue its importance. I\r\nfeel the less restraint, therefore, in observing, that the position\r\nconcerning the ignorance of the ancient governments on the subject\r\nof representation, is by no means precisely true in the latitude\r\ncommonly given to it. Without entering into a disquisition which\r\nhere would be misplaced, I will refer to a few known facts, in\r\nsupport of what I advance.\r\n\r\nIn the most pure democracies of Greece, many of the executive\r\nfunctions were performed, not by the people themselves, but by\r\nofficers elected by the people, and REPRESENTING the people in their\r\nEXECUTIVE capacity.\r\n\r\nPrior to the reform of Solon, Athens was governed by nine\r\nArchons, annually ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE AT LARGE. The degree of\r\npower delegated to them seems to be left in great obscurity.\r\nSubsequent to that period, we find an assembly, first of four, and\r\nafterwards of six hundred members, annually ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE;\r\nand PARTIALLY representing them in their LEGISLATIVE capacity,\r\nsince they were not only associated with the people in the function\r\nof making laws, but had the exclusive right of originating\r\nlegislative propositions to the people. The senate of Carthage,\r\nalso, whatever might be its power, or the duration of its\r\nappointment, appears to have been ELECTIVE by the suffrages of the\r\npeople. Similar instances might be traced in most, if not all the\r\npopular governments of antiquity.\r\n\r\nLastly, in Sparta we meet with the Ephori, and in Rome with the\r\nTribunes; two bodies, small indeed in numbers, but annually ELECTED\r\nBY THE WHOLE BODY OF THE PEOPLE, and considered as the\r\nREPRESENTATIVES of the people, almost in their PLENIPOTENTIARY\r\ncapacity. The Cosmi of Crete were also annually ELECTED BY THE\r\nPEOPLE, and have been considered by some authors as an institution\r\nanalogous to those of Sparta and Rome, with this difference only,\r\nthat in the election of that representative body the right of\r\nsuffrage was communicated to a part only of the people.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts, to which many others might be added, it is\r\nclear that the principle of representation was neither unknown to\r\nthe ancients nor wholly overlooked in their political constitutions.\r\nThe true distinction between these and the American governments,\r\nlies IN THE TOTAL EXCLUSION OF THE PEOPLE, IN THEIR COLLECTIVE\r\nCAPACITY, from any share in the LATTER, and not in the TOTAL\r\nEXCLUSION OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE from the\r\nadministration of the FORMER. The distinction, however, thus\r\nqualified, must be admitted to leave a most advantageous superiority\r\nin favor of the United States. But to insure to this advantage its\r\nfull effect, we must be careful not to separate it from the other\r\nadvantage, of an extensive territory. For it cannot be believed,\r\nthat any form of representative government could have succeeded\r\nwithin the narrow limits occupied by the democracies of Greece.\r\n\r\nIn answer to all these arguments, suggested by reason,\r\nillustrated by examples, and enforced by our own experience, the\r\njealous adversary of the Constitution will probably content himself\r\nwith repeating, that a senate appointed not immediately by the\r\npeople, and for the term of six years, must gradually acquire a\r\ndangerous pre-eminence in the government, and finally transform it\r\ninto a tyrannical aristocracy.\r\n\r\nTo this general answer, the general reply ought to be\r\nsufficient, that liberty may be endangered by the abuses of liberty\r\nas well as by the abuses of power; that there are numerous\r\ninstances of the former as well as of the latter; and that the\r\nformer, rather than the latter, are apparently most to be\r\napprehended by the United States. But a more particular reply may\r\nbe given.\r\n\r\nBefore such a revolution can be effected, the Senate, it is to\r\nbe observed, must in the first place corrupt itself; must next\r\ncorrupt the State legislatures; must then corrupt the House of\r\nRepresentatives; and must finally corrupt the people at large. It\r\nis evident that the Senate must be first corrupted before it can\r\nattempt an establishment of tyranny. Without corrupting the State\r\nlegislatures, it cannot prosecute the attempt, because the\r\nperiodical change of members would otherwise regenerate the whole\r\nbody. Without exerting the means of corruption with equal success\r\non the House of Representatives, the opposition of that coequal\r\nbranch of the government would inevitably defeat the attempt; and\r\nwithout corrupting the people themselves, a succession of new\r\nrepresentatives would speedily restore all things to their pristine\r\norder. Is there any man who can seriously persuade himself that the\r\nproposed Senate can, by any possible means within the compass of\r\nhuman address, arrive at the object of a lawless ambition, through\r\nall these obstructions?\r\n\r\nIf reason condemns the suspicion, the same sentence is\r\npronounced by experience. The constitution of Maryland furnishes\r\nthe most apposite example. The Senate of that State is elected, as\r\nthe federal Senate will be, indirectly by the people, and for a term\r\nless by one year only than the federal Senate. It is distinguished,\r\nalso, by the remarkable prerogative of filling up its own vacancies\r\nwithin the term of its appointment, and, at the same time, is not\r\nunder the control of any such rotation as is provided for the\r\nfederal Senate. There are some other lesser distinctions, which\r\nwould expose the former to colorable objections, that do not lie\r\nagainst the latter. If the federal Senate, therefore, really\r\ncontained the danger which has been so loudly proclaimed, some\r\nsymptoms at least of a like danger ought by this time to have been\r\nbetrayed by the Senate of Maryland, but no such symptoms have\r\nappeared. On the contrary, the jealousies at first entertained by\r\nmen of the same description with those who view with terror the\r\ncorrespondent part of the federal Constitution, have been gradually\r\nextinguished by the progress of the experiment; and the Maryland\r\nconstitution is daily deriving, from the salutary operation of this\r\npart of it, a reputation in which it will probably not be rivalled\r\nby that of any State in the Union.\r\n\r\nBut if any thing could silence the jealousies on this subject,\r\nit ought to be the British example. The Senate there instead of\r\nbeing elected for a term of six years, and of being unconfined to\r\nparticular families or fortunes, is an hereditary assembly of\r\nopulent nobles. The House of Representatives, instead of being\r\nelected for two years, and by the whole body of the people, is\r\nelected for seven years, and, in very great proportion, by a very\r\nsmall proportion of the people. Here, unquestionably, ought to be\r\nseen in full display the aristocratic usurpations and tyranny which\r\nare at some future period to be exemplified in the United States.\r\nUnfortunately, however, for the anti-federal argument, the British\r\nhistory informs us that this hereditary assembly has not been able\r\nto defend itself against the continual encroachments of the House of\r\nRepresentatives; and that it no sooner lost the support of the\r\nmonarch, than it was actually crushed by the weight of the popular\r\nbranch.\r\n\r\nAs far as antiquity can instruct us on this subject, its\r\nexamples support the reasoning which we have employed. In Sparta,\r\nthe Ephori, the annual representatives of the people, were found an\r\novermatch for the senate for life, continually gained on its\r\nauthority and finally drew all power into their own hands. The\r\nTribunes of Rome, who were the representatives of the people,\r\nprevailed, it is well known, in almost every contest with the senate\r\nfor life, and in the end gained the most complete triumph over it.\r\nThe fact is the more remarkable, as unanimity was required in every\r\nact of the Tribunes, even after their number was augmented to ten.\r\nIt proves the irresistible force possessed by that branch of a free\r\ngovernment, which has the people on its side. To these examples\r\nmight be added that of Carthage, whose senate, according to the\r\ntestimony of Polybius, instead of drawing all power into its vortex,\r\nhad, at the commencement of the second Punic War, lost almost the\r\nwhole of its original portion.\r\n\r\nBesides the conclusive evidence resulting from this assemblage\r\nof facts, that the federal Senate will never be able to transform\r\nitself, by gradual usurpations, into an independent and aristocratic\r\nbody, we are warranted in believing, that if such a revolution\r\nshould ever happen from causes which the foresight of man cannot\r\nguard against, the House of Representatives, with the people on\r\ntheir side, will at all times be able to bring back the Constitution\r\nto its primitive form and principles. Against the force of the\r\nimmediate representatives of the people, nothing will be able to\r\nmaintain even the constitutional authority of the Senate, but such a\r\ndisplay of enlightened policy, and attachment to the public good, as\r\nwill divide with that branch of the legislature the affections and\r\nsupport of the entire body of the people themselves.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 64\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Powers of the Senate\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nFriday, March 7, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nIT IS a just and not a new observation, that enemies to\r\nparticular persons, and opponents to particular measures, seldom\r\nconfine their censures to such things only in either as are worthy\r\nof blame. Unless on this principle, it is difficult to explain the\r\nmotives of their conduct, who condemn the proposed Constitution in\r\nthe aggregate, and treat with severity some of the most\r\nunexceptionable articles in it.\r\n\r\nThe second section gives power to the President, \"BY AND WITH\r\nTHE ADVICE AND CONSENT OF THE SENATE, TO MAKE TREATIES, PROVIDED TWO\r\nTHIRDS OF THE SENATORS PRESENT CONCUR.\"\r\n\r\nThe power of making treaties is an important one, especially as\r\nit relates to war, peace, and commerce; and it should not be\r\ndelegated but in such a mode, and with such precautions, as will\r\nafford the highest security that it will be exercised by men the\r\nbest qualified for the purpose, and in the manner most conducive to\r\nthe public good. The convention appears to have been attentive to\r\nboth these points: they have directed the President to be chosen by\r\nselect bodies of electors, to be deputed by the people for that\r\nexpress purpose; and they have committed the appointment of\r\nsenators to the State legislatures. This mode has, in such cases,\r\nvastly the advantage of elections by the people in their collective\r\ncapacity, where the activity of party zeal, taking the advantage of\r\nthe supineness, the ignorance, and the hopes and fears of the unwary\r\nand interested, often places men in office by the votes of a small\r\nproportion of the electors.\r\n\r\nAs the select assemblies for choosing the President, as well as\r\nthe State legislatures who appoint the senators, will in general be\r\ncomposed of the most enlightened and respectable citizens, there is\r\nreason to presume that their attention and their votes will be\r\ndirected to those men only who have become the most distinguished by\r\ntheir abilities and virtue, and in whom the people perceive just\r\ngrounds for confidence. The Constitution manifests very particular\r\nattention to this object. By excluding men under thirty-five from\r\nthe first office, and those under thirty from the second, it\r\nconfines the electors to men of whom the people have had time to\r\nform a judgment, and with respect to whom they will not be liable to\r\nbe deceived by those brilliant appearances of genius and patriotism,\r\nwhich, like transient meteors, sometimes mislead as well as dazzle.\r\nIf the observation be well founded, that wise kings will always be\r\nserved by able ministers, it is fair to argue, that as an assembly\r\nof select electors possess, in a greater degree than kings, the\r\nmeans of extensive and accurate information relative to men and\r\ncharacters, so will their appointments bear at least equal marks of\r\ndiscretion and discernment. The inference which naturally results\r\nfrom these considerations is this, that the President and senators\r\nso chosen will always be of the number of those who best understand\r\nour national interests, whether considered in relation to the\r\nseveral States or to foreign nations, who are best able to promote\r\nthose interests, and whose reputation for integrity inspires and\r\nmerits confidence. With such men the power of making treaties may\r\nbe safely lodged.\r\n\r\nAlthough the absolute necessity of system, in the conduct of any\r\nbusiness, is universally known and acknowledged, yet the high\r\nimportance of it in national affairs has not yet become sufficiently\r\nimpressed on the public mind. They who wish to commit the power\r\nunder consideration to a popular assembly, composed of members\r\nconstantly coming and going in quick succession, seem not to\r\nrecollect that such a body must necessarily be inadequate to the\r\nattainment of those great objects, which require to be steadily\r\ncontemplated in all their relations and circumstances, and which can\r\nonly be approached and achieved by measures which not only talents,\r\nbut also exact information, and often much time, are necessary to\r\nconcert and to execute. It was wise, therefore, in the convention\r\nto provide, not only that the power of making treaties should be\r\ncommitted to able and honest men, but also that they should continue\r\nin place a sufficient time to become perfectly acquainted with our\r\nnational concerns, and to form and introduce a a system for the\r\nmanagement of them. The duration prescribed is such as will give\r\nthem an opportunity of greatly extending their political\r\ninformation, and of rendering their accumulating experience more and\r\nmore beneficial to their country. Nor has the convention discovered\r\nless prudence in providing for the frequent elections of senators in\r\nsuch a way as to obviate the inconvenience of periodically\r\ntransferring those great affairs entirely to new men; for by\r\nleaving a considerable residue of the old ones in place, uniformity\r\nand order, as well as a constant succession of official information\r\nwill be preserved.\r\n\r\nThere are a few who will not admit that the affairs of trade and\r\nnavigation should be regulated by a system cautiously formed and\r\nsteadily pursued; and that both our treaties and our laws should\r\ncorrespond with and be made to promote it. It is of much\r\nconsequence that this correspondence and conformity be carefully\r\nmaintained; and they who assent to the truth of this position will\r\nsee and confess that it is well provided for by making concurrence\r\nof the Senate necessary both to treaties and to laws.\r\n\r\nIt seldom happens in the negotiation of treaties, of whatever\r\nnature, but that perfect SECRECY and immediate DESPATCH are\r\nsometimes requisite. These are cases where the most useful\r\nintelligence may be obtained, if the persons possessing it can be\r\nrelieved from apprehensions of discovery. Those apprehensions will\r\noperate on those persons whether they are actuated by mercenary or\r\nfriendly motives; and there doubtless are many of both\r\ndescriptions, who would rely on the secrecy of the President, but\r\nwho would not confide in that of the Senate, and still less in that\r\nof a large popular Assembly. The convention have done well,\r\ntherefore, in so disposing of the power of making treaties, that\r\nalthough the President must, in forming them, act by the advice and\r\nconsent of the Senate, yet he will be able to manage the business of\r\nintelligence in such a manner as prudence may suggest.\r\n\r\nThey who have turned their attention to the affairs of men, must\r\nhave perceived that there are tides in them; tides very irregular\r\nin their duration, strength, and direction, and seldom found to run\r\ntwice exactly in the same manner or measure. To discern and to\r\nprofit by these tides in national affairs is the business of those\r\nwho preside over them; and they who have had much experience on\r\nthis head inform us, that there frequently are occasions when days,\r\nnay, even when hours, are precious. The loss of a battle, the death\r\nof a prince, the removal of a minister, or other circumstances\r\nintervening to change the present posture and aspect of affairs, may\r\nturn the most favorable tide into a course opposite to our wishes.\r\nAs in the field, so in the cabinet, there are moments to be seized\r\nas they pass, and they who preside in either should be left in\r\ncapacity to improve them. So often and so essentially have we\r\nheretofore suffered from the want of secrecy and despatch, that the\r\nConstitution would have been inexcusably defective, if no attention\r\nhad been paid to those objects. Those matters which in negotiations\r\nusually require the most secrecy and the most despatch, are those\r\npreparatory and auxiliary measures which are not otherwise important\r\nin a national view, than as they tend to facilitate the attainment\r\nof the objects of the negotiation. For these, the President will\r\nfind no difficulty to provide; and should any circumstance occur\r\nwhich requires the advice and consent of the Senate, he may at any\r\ntime convene them. Thus we see that the Constitution provides that\r\nour negotiations for treaties shall have every advantage which can\r\nbe derived from talents, information, integrity, and deliberate\r\ninvestigations, on the one hand, and from secrecy and despatch on\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nBut to this plan, as to most others that have ever appeared,\r\nobjections are contrived and urged.\r\n\r\nSome are displeased with it, not on account of any errors or\r\ndefects in it, but because, as the treaties, when made, are to have\r\nthe force of laws, they should be made only by men invested with\r\nlegislative authority. These gentlemen seem not to consider that\r\nthe judgments of our courts, and the commissions constitutionally\r\ngiven by our governor, are as valid and as binding on all persons\r\nwhom they concern, as the laws passed by our legislature. All\r\nconstitutional acts of power, whether in the executive or in the\r\njudicial department, have as much legal validity and obligation as\r\nif they proceeded from the legislature; and therefore, whatever\r\nname be given to the power of making treaties, or however obligatory\r\nthey may be when made, certain it is, that the people may, with much\r\npropriety, commit the power to a distinct body from the legislature,\r\nthe executive, or the judicial. It surely does not follow, that\r\nbecause they have given the power of making laws to the legislature,\r\nthat therefore they should likewise give them the power to do every\r\nother act of sovereignty by which the citizens are to be bound and\r\naffected.\r\n\r\nOthers, though content that treaties should be made in the mode\r\nproposed, are averse to their being the SUPREME laws of the land.\r\nThey insist, and profess to believe, that treaties like acts of\r\nassembly, should be repealable at pleasure. This idea seems to be\r\nnew and peculiar to this country, but new errors, as well as new\r\ntruths, often appear. These gentlemen would do well to reflect that\r\na treaty is only another name for a bargain, and that it would be\r\nimpossible to find a nation who would make any bargain with us,\r\nwhich should be binding on them ABSOLUTELY, but on us only so long\r\nand so far as we may think proper to be bound by it. They who make\r\nlaws may, without doubt, amend or repeal them; and it will not be\r\ndisputed that they who make treaties may alter or cancel them; but\r\nstill let us not forget that treaties are made, not by only one of\r\nthe contracting parties, but by both; and consequently, that as the\r\nconsent of both was essential to their formation at first, so must\r\nit ever afterwards be to alter or cancel them. The proposed\r\nConstitution, therefore, has not in the least extended the\r\nobligation of treaties. They are just as binding, and just as far\r\nbeyond the lawful reach of legislative acts now, as they will be at\r\nany future period, or under any form of government.\r\n\r\nHowever useful jealousy may be in republics, yet when like bile\r\nin the natural, it abounds too much in the body politic, the eyes of\r\nboth become very liable to be deceived by the delusive appearances\r\nwhich that malady casts on surrounding objects. From this cause,\r\nprobably, proceed the fears and apprehensions of some, that the\r\nPresident and Senate may make treaties without an equal eye to the\r\ninterests of all the States. Others suspect that two thirds will\r\noppress the remaining third, and ask whether those gentlemen are\r\nmade sufficiently responsible for their conduct; whether, if they\r\nact corruptly, they can be punished; and if they make\r\ndisadvantageous treaties, how are we to get rid of those treaties?\r\n\r\nAs all the States are equally represented in the Senate, and by\r\nmen the most able and the most willing to promote the interests of\r\ntheir constituents, they will all have an equal degree of influence\r\nin that body, especially while they continue to be careful in\r\nappointing proper persons, and to insist on their punctual\r\nattendance. In proportion as the United States assume a national\r\nform and a national character, so will the good of the whole be more\r\nand more an object of attention, and the government must be a weak\r\none indeed, if it should forget that the good of the whole can only\r\nbe promoted by advancing the good of each of the parts or members\r\nwhich compose the whole. It will not be in the power of the\r\nPresident and Senate to make any treaties by which they and their\r\nfamilies and estates will not be equally bound and affected with the\r\nrest of the community; and, having no private interests distinct\r\nfrom that of the nation, they will be under no temptations to\r\nneglect the latter.\r\n\r\nAs to corruption, the case is not supposable. He must either\r\nhave been very unfortunate in his intercourse with the world, or\r\npossess a heart very susceptible of such impressions, who can think\r\nit probable that the President and two thirds of the Senate will\r\never be capable of such unworthy conduct. The idea is too gross and\r\ntoo invidious to be entertained. But in such a case, if it should\r\never happen, the treaty so obtained from us would, like all other\r\nfraudulent contracts, be null and void by the law of nations.\r\n\r\nWith respect to their responsibility, it is difficult to\r\nconceive how it could be increased. Every consideration that can\r\ninfluence the human mind, such as honor, oaths, reputations,\r\nconscience, the love of country, and family affections and\r\nattachments, afford security for their fidelity. In short, as the\r\nConstitution has taken the utmost care that they shall be men of\r\ntalents and integrity, we have reason to be persuaded that the\r\ntreaties they make will be as advantageous as, all circumstances\r\nconsidered, could be made; and so far as the fear of punishment and\r\ndisgrace can operate, that motive to good behavior is amply afforded\r\nby the article on the subject of impeachments.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 65\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Powers of the Senate Continued\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nFriday, March 7, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTHE remaining powers which the plan of the convention allots to\r\nthe Senate, in a distinct capacity, are comprised in their\r\nparticipation with the executive in the appointment to offices, and\r\nin their judicial character as a court for the trial of impeachments.\r\nAs in the business of appointments the executive will be the\r\nprincipal agent, the provisions relating to it will most properly be\r\ndiscussed in the examination of that department. We will,\r\ntherefore, conclude this head with a view of the judicial character\r\nof the Senate.\r\n\r\nA well-constituted court for the trial of impeachments is an\r\nobject not more to be desired than difficult to be obtained in a\r\ngovernment wholly elective. The subjects of its jurisdiction are\r\nthose offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or,\r\nin other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.\r\nThey are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be\r\ndenominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done\r\nimmediately to the society itself. The prosecution of them, for\r\nthis reason, will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole\r\ncommunity, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or\r\ninimical to the accused. In many cases it will connect itself with\r\nthe pre-existing factions, and will enlist all their animosities,\r\npartialities, influence, and interest on one side or on the other;\r\nand in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the\r\ndecision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of\r\nparties, than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.\r\n\r\nThe delicacy and magnitude of a trust which so deeply concerns\r\nthe political reputation and existence of every man engaged in the\r\nadministration of public affairs, speak for themselves. The\r\ndifficulty of placing it rightly, in a government resting entirely\r\non the basis of periodical elections, will as readily be perceived,\r\nwhen it is considered that the most conspicuous characters in it\r\nwill, from that circumstance, be too often the leaders or the tools\r\nof the most cunning or the most numerous faction, and on this\r\naccount, can hardly be expected to possess the requisite neutrality\r\ntowards those whose conduct may be the subject of scrutiny.\r\n\r\nThe convention, it appears, thought the Senate the most fit\r\ndepositary of this important trust. Those who can best discern the\r\nintrinsic difficulty of the thing, will be least hasty in condemning\r\nthat opinion, and will be most inclined to allow due weight to the\r\narguments which may be supposed to have produced it.\r\n\r\nWhat, it may be asked, is the true spirit of the institution\r\nitself? Is it not designed as a method of NATIONAL INQUEST into the\r\nconduct of public men? If this be the design of it, who can so\r\nproperly be the inquisitors for the nation as the representatives of\r\nthe nation themselves? It is not disputed that the power of\r\noriginating the inquiry, or, in other words, of preferring the\r\nimpeachment, ought to be lodged in the hands of one branch of the\r\nlegislative body. Will not the reasons which indicate the propriety\r\nof this arrangement strongly plead for an admission of the other\r\nbranch of that body to a share of the inquiry? The model from which\r\nthe idea of this institution has been borrowed, pointed out that\r\ncourse to the convention. In Great Britain it is the province of\r\nthe House of Commons to prefer the impeachment, and of the House of\r\nLords to decide upon it. Several of the State constitutions have\r\nfollowed the example. As well the latter, as the former, seem to\r\nhave regarded the practice of impeachments as a bridle in the hands\r\nof the legislative body upon the executive servants of the\r\ngovernment. Is not this the true light in which it ought to be\r\nregarded?\r\n\r\nWhere else than in the Senate could have been found a tribunal\r\nsufficiently dignified, or sufficiently independent? What other\r\nbody would be likely to feel CONFIDENCE ENOUGH IN ITS OWN SITUATION,\r\nto preserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the necessary impartiality\r\nbetween an INDIVIDUAL accused, and the REPRESENTATIVES OF THE\r\nPEOPLE, HIS ACCUSERS?\r\n\r\nCould the Supreme Court have been relied upon as answering this\r\ndescription? It is much to be doubted, whether the members of that\r\ntribunal would at all times be endowed with so eminent a portion of\r\nfortitude, as would be called for in the execution of so difficult a\r\ntask; and it is still more to be doubted, whether they would\r\npossess the degree of credit and authority, which might, on certain\r\noccasions, be indispensable towards reconciling the people to a\r\ndecision that should happen to clash with an accusation brought by\r\ntheir immediate representatives. A deficiency in the first, would\r\nbe fatal to the accused; in the last, dangerous to the public\r\ntranquillity. The hazard in both these respects, could only be\r\navoided, if at all, by rendering that tribunal more numerous than\r\nwould consist with a reasonable attention to economy. The necessity\r\nof a numerous court for the trial of impeachments, is equally\r\ndictated by the nature of the proceeding. This can never be tied\r\ndown by such strict rules, either in the delineation of the offense\r\nby the prosecutors, or in the construction of it by the judges, as\r\nin common cases serve to limit the discretion of courts in favor of\r\npersonal security. There will be no jury to stand between the\r\njudges who are to pronounce the sentence of the law, and the party\r\nwho is to receive or suffer it. The awful discretion which a court\r\nof impeachments must necessarily have, to doom to honor or to infamy\r\nthe most confidential and the most distinguished characters of the\r\ncommunity, forbids the commitment of the trust to a small number of\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nThese considerations seem alone sufficient to authorize a\r\nconclusion, that the Supreme Court would have been an improper\r\nsubstitute for the Senate, as a court of impeachments. There\r\nremains a further consideration, which will not a little strengthen\r\nthis conclusion. It is this: The punishment which may be the\r\nconsequence of conviction upon impeachment, is not to terminate the\r\nchastisement of the offender. After having been sentenced to a\r\nperpetual ostracism from the esteem and confidence, and honors and\r\nemoluments of his country, he will still be liable to prosecution\r\nand punishment in the ordinary course of law. Would it be proper\r\nthat the persons who had disposed of his fame, and his most valuable\r\nrights as a citizen in one trial, should, in another trial, for the\r\nsame offense, be also the disposers of his life and his fortune?\r\nWould there not be the greatest reason to apprehend, that error, in\r\nthe first sentence, would be the parent of error in the second\r\nsentence? That the strong bias of one decision would be apt to\r\noverrule the influence of any new lights which might be brought to\r\nvary the complexion of another decision? Those who know anything of\r\nhuman nature, will not hesitate to answer these questions in the\r\naffirmative; and will be at no loss to perceive, that by making the\r\nsame persons judges in both cases, those who might happen to be the\r\nobjects of prosecution would, in a great measure, be deprived of the\r\ndouble security intended them by a double trial. The loss of life\r\nand estate would often be virtually included in a sentence which, in\r\nits terms, imported nothing more than dismission from a present, and\r\ndisqualification for a future, office. It may be said, that the\r\nintervention of a jury, in the second instance, would obviate the\r\ndanger. But juries are frequently influenced by the opinions of\r\njudges. They are sometimes induced to find special verdicts, which\r\nrefer the main question to the decision of the court. Who would be\r\nwilling to stake his life and his estate upon the verdict of a jury\r\nacting under the auspices of judges who had predetermined his guilt?\r\n\r\nWould it have been an improvement of the plan, to have united\r\nthe Supreme Court with the Senate, in the formation of the court of\r\nimpeachments? This union would certainly have been attended with\r\nseveral advantages; but would they not have been overbalanced by\r\nthe signal disadvantage, already stated, arising from the agency of\r\nthe same judges in the double prosecution to which the offender\r\nwould be liable? To a certain extent, the benefits of that union\r\nwill be obtained from making the chief justice of the Supreme Court\r\nthe president of the court of impeachments, as is proposed to be\r\ndone in the plan of the convention; while the inconveniences of an\r\nentire incorporation of the former into the latter will be\r\nsubstantially avoided. This was perhaps the prudent mean. I\r\nforbear to remark upon the additional pretext for clamor against the\r\njudiciary, which so considerable an augmentation of its authority\r\nwould have afforded.\r\n\r\nWould it have been desirable to have composed the court for the\r\ntrial of impeachments, of persons wholly distinct from the other\r\ndepartments of the government? There are weighty arguments, as well\r\nagainst, as in favor of, such a plan. To some minds it will not\r\nappear a trivial objection, that it could tend to increase the\r\ncomplexity of the political machine, and to add a new spring to the\r\ngovernment, the utility of which would at best be questionable. But\r\nan objection which will not be thought by any unworthy of attention,\r\nis this: a court formed upon such a plan, would either be attended\r\nwith a heavy expense, or might in practice be subject to a variety\r\nof casualties and inconveniences. It must either consist of\r\npermanent officers, stationary at the seat of government, and of\r\ncourse entitled to fixed and regular stipends, or of certain\r\nofficers of the State governments to be called upon whenever an\r\nimpeachment was actually depending. It will not be easy to imagine\r\nany third mode materially different, which could rationally be\r\nproposed. As the court, for reasons already given, ought to be\r\nnumerous, the first scheme will be reprobated by every man who can\r\ncompare the extent of the public wants with the means of supplying\r\nthem. The second will be espoused with caution by those who will\r\nseriously consider the difficulty of collecting men dispersed over\r\nthe whole Union; the injury to the innocent, from the\r\nprocrastinated determination of the charges which might be brought\r\nagainst them; the advantage to the guilty, from the opportunities\r\nwhich delay would afford to intrigue and corruption; and in some\r\ncases the detriment to the State, from the prolonged inaction of men\r\nwhose firm and faithful execution of their duty might have exposed\r\nthem to the persecution of an intemperate or designing majority in\r\nthe House of Representatives. Though this latter supposition may\r\nseem harsh, and might not be likely often to be verified, yet it\r\nought not to be forgotten that the demon of faction will, at certain\r\nseasons, extend his sceptre over all numerous bodies of men.\r\n\r\nBut though one or the other of the substitutes which have been\r\nexamined, or some other that might be devised, should be thought\r\npreferable to the plan in this respect, reported by the convention,\r\nit will not follow that the Constitution ought for this reason to be\r\nrejected. If mankind were to resolve to agree in no institution of\r\ngovernment, until every part of it had been adjusted to the most\r\nexact standard of perfection, society would soon become a general\r\nscene of anarchy, and the world a desert. Where is the standard of\r\nperfection to be found? Who will undertake to unite the discordant\r\nopinions of a whole community, in the same judgment of it; and to\r\nprevail upon one conceited projector to renounce his INFALLIBLE\r\ncriterion for the FALLIBLE criterion of his more CONCEITED NEIGHBOR?\r\nTo answer the purpose of the adversaries of the Constitution, they\r\nought to prove, not merely that particular provisions in it are not\r\nthe best which might have been imagined, but that the plan upon the\r\nwhole is bad and pernicious.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 66\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjections to the Power of the Senate To Set as a Court for\r\nImpeachments Further Considered\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, March 11, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nA REVIEW of the principal objections that have appeared against\r\nthe proposed court for the trial of impeachments, will not\r\nimprobably eradicate the remains of any unfavorable impressions\r\nwhich may still exist in regard to this matter.\r\n\r\nThe FIRST of these objections is, that the provision in question\r\nconfounds legislative and judiciary authorities in the same body, in\r\nviolation of that important and wellestablished maxim which requires\r\na separation between the different departments of power. The true\r\nmeaning of this maxim has been discussed and ascertained in another\r\nplace, and has been shown to be entirely compatible with a partial\r\nintermixture of those departments for special purposes, preserving\r\nthem, in the main, distinct and unconnected. This partial\r\nintermixture is even, in some cases, not only proper but necessary\r\nto the mutual defense of the several members of the government\r\nagainst each other. An absolute or qualified negative in the\r\nexecutive upon the acts of the legislative body, is admitted, by the\r\nablest adepts in political science, to be an indispensable barrier\r\nagainst the encroachments of the latter upon the former. And it\r\nmay, perhaps, with no less reason be contended, that the powers\r\nrelating to impeachments are, as before intimated, an essential\r\ncheck in the hands of that body upon the encroachments of the\r\nexecutive. The division of them between the two branches of the\r\nlegislature, assigning to one the right of accusing, to the other\r\nthe right of judging, avoids the inconvenience of making the same\r\npersons both accusers and judges; and guards against the danger of\r\npersecution, from the prevalency of a factious spirit in either of\r\nthose branches. As the concurrence of two thirds of the Senate will\r\nbe requisite to a condemnation, the security to innocence, from this\r\nadditional circumstance, will be as complete as itself can desire.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe, with what vehemence this part of the\r\nplan is assailed, on the principle here taken notice of, by men who\r\nprofess to admire, without exception, the constitution of this\r\nState; while that constitution makes the Senate, together with the\r\nchancellor and judges of the Supreme Court, not only a court of\r\nimpeachments, but the highest judicatory in the State, in all\r\ncauses, civil and criminal. The proportion, in point of numbers, of\r\nthe chancellor and judges to the senators, is so inconsiderable,\r\nthat the judiciary authority of New York, in the last resort, may,\r\nwith truth, be said to reside in its Senate. If the plan of the\r\nconvention be, in this respect, chargeable with a departure from the\r\ncelebrated maxim which has been so often mentioned, and seems to be\r\nso little understood, how much more culpable must be the\r\nconstitution of New York?1\r\n\r\nA SECOND objection to the Senate, as a court of impeachments,\r\nis, that it contributes to an undue accumulation of power in that\r\nbody, tending to give to the government a countenance too\r\naristocratic. The Senate, it is observed, is to have concurrent\r\nauthority with the Executive in the formation of treaties and in the\r\nappointment to offices: if, say the objectors, to these\r\nprerogatives is added that of deciding in all cases of impeachment,\r\nit will give a decided predominancy to senatorial influence. To an\r\nobjection so little precise in itself, it is not easy to find a very\r\nprecise answer. Where is the measure or criterion to which we can\r\nappeal, for determining what will give the Senate too much, too\r\nlittle, or barely the proper degree of influence? Will it not be\r\nmore safe, as well as more simple, to dismiss such vague and\r\nuncertain calculations, to examine each power by itself, and to\r\ndecide, on general principles, where it may be deposited with most\r\nadvantage and least inconvenience?\r\n\r\nIf we take this course, it will lead to a more intelligible, if\r\nnot to a more certain result. The disposition of the power of\r\nmaking treaties, which has obtained in the plan of the convention,\r\nwill, then, if I mistake not, appear to be fully justified by the\r\nconsiderations stated in a former number, and by others which will\r\noccur under the next head of our inquiries. The expediency of the\r\njunction of the Senate with the Executive, in the power of\r\nappointing to offices, will, I trust, be placed in a light not less\r\nsatisfactory, in the disquisitions under the same head. And I\r\nflatter myself the observations in my last paper must have gone no\r\ninconsiderable way towards proving that it was not easy, if\r\npracticable, to find a more fit receptacle for the power of\r\ndetermining impeachments, than that which has been chosen. If this\r\nbe truly the case, the hypothetical dread of the too great weight of\r\nthe Senate ought to be discarded from our reasonings.\r\n\r\nBut this hypothesis, such as it is, has already been refuted in\r\nthe remarks applied to the duration in office prescribed for the\r\nsenators. It was by them shown, as well on the credit of historical\r\nexamples, as from the reason of the thing, that the most POPULAR\r\nbranch of every government, partaking of the republican genius, by\r\nbeing generally the favorite of the people, will be as generally a\r\nfull match, if not an overmatch, for every other member of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nBut independent of this most active and operative principle, to\r\nsecure the equilibrium of the national House of Representatives, the\r\nplan of the convention has provided in its favor several important\r\ncounterpoises to the additional authorities to be conferred upon the\r\nSenate. The exclusive privilege of originating money bills will\r\nbelong to the House of Representatives. The same house will possess\r\nthe sole right of instituting impeachments: is not this a complete\r\ncounterbalance to that of determining them? The same house will be\r\nthe umpire in all elections of the President, which do not unite the\r\nsuffrages of a majority of the whole number of electors; a case\r\nwhich it cannot be doubted will sometimes, if not frequently, happen.\r\nThe constant possibility of the thing must be a fruitful source of\r\ninfluence to that body. The more it is contemplated, the more\r\nimportant will appear this ultimate though contingent power, of\r\ndeciding the competitions of the most illustrious citizens of the\r\nUnion, for the first office in it. It would not perhaps be rash to\r\npredict, that as a mean of influence it will be found to outweigh\r\nall the peculiar attributes of the Senate.\r\n\r\nA THIRD objection to the Senate as a court of impeachments, is\r\ndrawn from the agency they are to have in the appointments to office.\r\nIt is imagined that they would be too indulgent judges of the\r\nconduct of men, in whose official creation they had participated.\r\nThe principle of this objection would condemn a practice, which is\r\nto be seen in all the State governments, if not in all the\r\ngovernments with which we are acquainted: I mean that of rendering\r\nthose who hold offices during pleasure, dependent on the pleasure of\r\nthose who appoint them. With equal plausibility might it be alleged\r\nin this case, that the favoritism of the latter would always be an\r\nasylum for the misbehavior of the former. But that practice, in\r\ncontradiction to this principle, proceeds upon the presumption, that\r\nthe responsibility of those who appoint, for the fitness and\r\ncompetency of the persons on whom they bestow their choice, and the\r\ninterest they will have in the respectable and prosperous\r\nadministration of affairs, will inspire a sufficient disposition to\r\ndismiss from a share in it all such who, by their conduct, shall\r\nhave proved themselves unworthy of the confidence reposed in them.\r\nThough facts may not always correspond with this presumption, yet\r\nif it be, in the main, just, it must destroy the supposition that\r\nthe Senate, who will merely sanction the choice of the Executive,\r\nshould feel a bias, towards the objects of that choice, strong\r\nenough to blind them to the evidences of guilt so extraordinary, as\r\nto have induced the representatives of the nation to become its\r\naccusers.\r\n\r\nIf any further arguments were necessary to evince the\r\nimprobability of such a bias, it might be found in the nature of the\r\nagency of the Senate in the business of appointments.\r\n\r\nIt will be the office of the President to NOMINATE, and, with\r\nthe advice and consent of the Senate, to APPOINT. There will, of\r\ncourse, be no exertion of CHOICE on the part of the Senate. They\r\nmay defeat one choice of the Executive, and oblige him to make\r\nanother; but they cannot themselves CHOOSE, they can only ratify or\r\nreject the choice of the President. They might even entertain a\r\npreference to some other person, at the very moment they were\r\nassenting to the one proposed, because there might be no positive\r\nground of opposition to him; and they could not be sure, if they\r\nwithheld their assent, that the subsequent nomination would fall\r\nupon their own favorite, or upon any other person in their\r\nestimation more meritorious than the one rejected. Thus it could\r\nhardly happen, that the majority of the Senate would feel any other\r\ncomplacency towards the object of an appointment than such as the\r\nappearances of merit might inspire, and the proofs of the want of it\r\ndestroy.\r\n\r\nA FOURTH objection to the Senate in the capacity of a court of\r\nimpeachments, is derived from its union with the Executive in the\r\npower of making treaties. This, it has been said, would constitute\r\nthe senators their own judges, in every case of a corrupt or\r\nperfidious execution of that trust. After having combined with the\r\nExecutive in betraying the interests of the nation in a ruinous\r\ntreaty, what prospect, it is asked, would there be of their being\r\nmade to suffer the punishment they would deserve, when they were\r\nthemselves to decide upon the accusation brought against them for\r\nthe treachery of which they have been guilty?\r\n\r\nThis objection has been circulated with more earnestness and\r\nwith greater show of reason than any other which has appeared\r\nagainst this part of the plan; and yet I am deceived if it does not\r\nrest upon an erroneous foundation.\r\n\r\nThe security essentially intended by the Constitution against\r\ncorruption and treachery in the formation of treaties, is to be\r\nsought for in the numbers and characters of those who are to make\r\nthem. The JOINT AGENCY of the Chief Magistrate of the Union, and of\r\ntwo thirds of the members of a body selected by the collective\r\nwisdom of the legislatures of the several States, is designed to be\r\nthe pledge for the fidelity of the national councils in this\r\nparticular. The convention might with propriety have meditated the\r\npunishment of the Executive, for a deviation from the instructions\r\nof the Senate, or a want of integrity in the conduct of the\r\nnegotiations committed to him; they might also have had in view the\r\npunishment of a few leading individuals in the Senate, who should\r\nhave prostituted their influence in that body as the mercenary\r\ninstruments of foreign corruption: but they could not, with more or\r\nwith equal propriety, have contemplated the impeachment and\r\npunishment of two thirds of the Senate, consenting to an improper\r\ntreaty, than of a majority of that or of the other branch of the\r\nnational legislature, consenting to a pernicious or unconstitutional\r\nlaw, a principle which, I believe, has never been admitted into any\r\ngovernment. How, in fact, could a majority in the House of\r\nRepresentatives impeach themselves? Not better, it is evident, than\r\ntwo thirds of the Senate might try themselves. And yet what reason\r\nis there, that a majority of the House of Representatives,\r\nsacrificing the interests of the society by an unjust and tyrannical\r\nact of legislation, should escape with impunity, more than two\r\nthirds of the Senate, sacrificing the same interests in an injurious\r\ntreaty with a foreign power? The truth is, that in all such cases\r\nit is essential to the freedom and to the necessary independence of\r\nthe deliberations of the body, that the members of it should be\r\nexempt from punishment for acts done in a collective capacity; and\r\nthe security to the society must depend on the care which is taken\r\nto confide the trust to proper hands, to make it their interest to\r\nexecute it with fidelity, and to make it as difficult as possible\r\nfor them to combine in any interest opposite to that of the public\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nSo far as might concern the misbehavior of the Executive in\r\nperverting the instructions or contravening the views of the Senate,\r\nwe need not be apprehensive of the want of a disposition in that\r\nbody to punish the abuse of their confidence or to vindicate their\r\nown authority. We may thus far count upon their pride, if not upon\r\ntheir virtue. And so far even as might concern the corruption of\r\nleading members, by whose arts and influence the majority may have\r\nbeen inveigled into measures odious to the community, if the proofs\r\nof that corruption should be satisfactory, the usual propensity of\r\nhuman nature will warrant us in concluding that there would be\r\ncommonly no defect of inclination in the body to divert the public\r\nresentment from themselves by a ready sacrifice of the authors of\r\ntheir mismanagement and disgrace.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\nIn that of New Jersey, also, the final judiciary authority is in\r\na branch of the legislature. In New Hampshire, Massachusetts,\r\nPennsylvanis, and South Carolina, one branch of the legislature is\r\nthe court for the trial of impeachments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 67\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Executive Department\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, March 11, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTHE constitution of the executive department of the proposed\r\ngovernment, claims next our attention.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly any part of the system which could have been\r\nattended with greater difficulty in the arrangement of it than this;\r\nand there is, perhaps, none which has been inveighed against with\r\nless candor or criticised with less judgment.\r\n\r\nHere the writers against the Constitution seem to have taken\r\npains to signalize their talent of misrepresentation. Calculating\r\nupon the aversion of the people to monarchy, they have endeavored to\r\nenlist all their jealousies and apprehensions in opposition to the\r\nintended President of the United States; not merely as the embryo,\r\nbut as the full-grown progeny, of that detested parent. To\r\nestablish the pretended affinity, they have not scrupled to draw\r\nresources even from the regions of fiction. The authorities of a\r\nmagistrate, in few instances greater, in some instances less, than\r\nthose of a governor of New York, have been magnified into more than\r\nroyal prerogatives. He has been decorated with attributes superior\r\nin dignity and splendor to those of a king of Great Britain. He has\r\nbeen shown to us with the diadem sparkling on his brow and the\r\nimperial purple flowing in his train. He has been seated on a\r\nthrone surrounded with minions and mistresses, giving audience to\r\nthe envoys of foreign potentates, in all the supercilious pomp of\r\nmajesty. The images of Asiatic despotism and voluptuousness have\r\nscarcely been wanting to crown the exaggerated scene. We have been\r\ntaught to tremble at the terrific visages of murdering janizaries,\r\nand to blush at the unveiled mysteries of a future seraglio.\r\n\r\nAttempts so extravagant as these to disfigure or, it might\r\nrather be said, to metamorphose the object, render it necessary to\r\ntake an accurate view of its real nature and form: in order as well\r\nto ascertain its true aspect and genuine appearance, as to unmask\r\nthe disingenuity and expose the fallacy of the counterfeit\r\nresemblances which have been so insidiously, as well as\r\nindustriously, propagated.\r\n\r\nIn the execution of this task, there is no man who would not\r\nfind it an arduous effort either to behold with moderation, or to\r\ntreat with seriousness, the devices, not less weak than wicked,\r\nwhich have been contrived to pervert the public opinion in relation\r\nto the subject. They so far exceed the usual though unjustifiable\r\nlicenses of party artifice, that even in a disposition the most\r\ncandid and tolerant, they must force the sentiments which favor an\r\nindulgent construction of the conduct of political adversaries to\r\ngive place to a voluntary and unreserved indignation. It is\r\nimpossible not to bestow the imputation of deliberate imposture and\r\ndeception upon the gross pretense of a similitude between a king of\r\nGreat Britain and a magistrate of the character marked out for that\r\nof the President of the United States. It is still more impossible\r\nto withhold that imputation from the rash and barefaced expedients\r\nwhich have been employed to give success to the attempted imposition.\r\n\r\nIn one instance, which I cite as a sample of the general spirit,\r\nthe temerity has proceeded so far as to ascribe to the President of\r\nthe United States a power which by the instrument reported is\r\nEXPRESSLY allotted to the Executives of the individual States. I\r\nmean the power of filling casual vacancies in the Senate.\r\n\r\nThis bold experiment upon the discernment of his countrymen has\r\nbeen hazarded by a writer who (whatever may be his real merit) has\r\nhad no inconsiderable share in the applauses of his party1; and\r\nwho, upon this false and unfounded suggestion, has built a series of\r\nobservations equally false and unfounded. Let him now be confronted\r\nwith the evidence of the fact, and let him, if he be able, justify\r\nor extenuate the shameful outrage he has offered to the dictates of\r\ntruth and to the rules of fair dealing.\r\n\r\nThe second clause of the second section of the second article\r\nempowers the President of the United States \"to nominate, and by\r\nand with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint\r\nambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the\r\nSupreme Court, and all other OFFICERS of United States whose\r\nappointments are NOT in the Constitution OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR, and\r\nWHICH SHALL BE ESTABLISHED BY LAW.\" Immediately after this clause\r\nfollows another in these words: \"The President shall have power to\r\nfill up ?? VACANCIES that may happen DURING THE RECESS OF THE\r\nSENATE, by granting commissions which shall EXPIRE AT THE END OF\r\nTHEIR NEXT SESSION.\" It is from this last provision that the\r\npretended power of the President to fill vacancies in the Senate has\r\nbeen deduced. A slight attention to the connection of the clauses,\r\nand to the obvious meaning of the terms, will satisfy us that the\r\ndeduction is not even colorable.\r\n\r\nThe first of these two clauses, it is clear, only provides a\r\nmode for appointing such officers, \"whose appointments are NOT\r\nOTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR in the Constitution, and which SHALL BE\r\nESTABLISHED BY LAW\"; of course it cannot extend to the\r\nappointments of senators, whose appointments are OTHERWISE PROVIDED\r\nFOR in the Constitution2, and who are ESTABLISHED BY THE\r\nCONSTITUTION, and will not require a future establishment by law.\r\nThis position will hardly be contested.\r\n\r\nThe last of these two clauses, it is equally clear, cannot be\r\nunderstood to comprehend the power of filling vacancies in the\r\nSenate, for the following reasons:  First. The relation in\r\nwhich that clause stands to the other, which declares the general\r\nmode of appointing officers of the United States, denotes it to be\r\nnothing more than a supplement to the other, for the purpose of\r\nestablishing an auxiliary method of appointment, in cases to which\r\nthe general method was inadequate. The ordinary power of\r\nappointment is confined to the President and Senate JOINTLY, and can\r\ntherefore only be exercised during the session of the Senate; but\r\nas it would have been improper to oblige this body to be continually\r\nin session for the appointment of officers and as vacancies might\r\nhappen IN THEIR RECESS, which it might be necessary for the public\r\nservice to fill without delay, the succeeding clause is evidently\r\nintended to authorize the President, SINGLY, to make temporary\r\nappointments \"during the recess of the Senate, by granting\r\ncommissions which shall expire at the end of their next session.\"\r\nSecondly. If this clause is to be considered as supplementary\r\nto the one which precedes, the VACANCIES of which it speaks must be\r\nconstrued to relate to the \"officers\" described in the preceding\r\none; and this, we have seen, excludes from its description the\r\nmembers of the Senate. Thirdly. The time within which the\r\npower is to operate, \"during the recess of the Senate,\" and the\r\nduration of the appointments, \"to the end of the next session\" of\r\nthat body, conspire to elucidate the sense of the provision, which,\r\nif it had been intended to comprehend senators, would naturally have\r\nreferred the temporary power of filling vacancies to the recess of\r\nthe State legislatures, who are to make the permanent appointments,\r\nand not to the recess of the national Senate, who are to have no\r\nconcern in those appointments; and would have extended the duration\r\nin office of the temporary senators to the next session of the\r\nlegislature of the State, in whose representation the vacancies had\r\nhappened, instead of making it to expire at the end of the ensuing\r\nsession of the national Senate. The circumstances of the body\r\nauthorized to make the permanent appointments would, of course, have\r\ngoverned the modification of a power which related to the temporary\r\nappointments; and as the national Senate is the body, whose\r\nsituation is alone contemplated in the clause upon which the\r\nsuggestion under examination has been founded, the vacancies to\r\nwhich it alludes can only be deemed to respect those officers in\r\nwhose appointment that body has a concurrent agency with the\r\nPresident. But lastly, the first and second clauses of the\r\nthird section of the first article, not only obviate all possibility\r\nof doubt, but destroy the pretext of misconception. The former\r\nprovides, that \"the Senate of the United States shall be composed\r\nof two Senators from each State, chosen BY THE LEGISLATURE THEREOF\r\nfor six years\"; and the latter directs, that, \"if vacancies in\r\nthat body should happen by resignation or otherwise, DURING THE\r\nRECESS OF THE LEGISLATURE OF ANY STATE, the Executive THEREOF may\r\nmake temporary appointments until the NEXT MEETING OF THE\r\nLEGISLATURE, which shall then fill such vacancies.\" Here is an\r\nexpress power given, in clear and unambiguous terms, to the State\r\nExecutives, to fill casual vacancies in the Senate, by temporary\r\nappointments; which not only invalidates the supposition, that the\r\nclause before considered could have been intended to confer that\r\npower upon the President of the United States, but proves that this\r\nsupposition, destitute as it is even of the merit of plausibility,\r\nmust have originated in an intention to deceive the people, too\r\npalpable to be obscured by sophistry, too atrocious to be palliated\r\nby hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nI have taken the pains to select this instance of\r\nmisrepresentation, and to place it in a clear and strong light, as\r\nan unequivocal proof of the unwarrantable arts which are practiced\r\nto prevent a fair and impartial judgment of the real merits of the\r\nConstitution submitted to the consideration of the people. Nor have\r\nI scrupled, in so flagrant a case, to allow myself a severity of\r\nanimadversion little congenial with the general spirit of these\r\npapers. I hesitate not to submit it to the decision of any candid\r\nand honest adversary of the proposed government, whether language\r\ncan furnish epithets of too much asperity, for so shameless and so\r\nprostitute an attempt to impose on the citizens of America.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n1 See CATO, No. V.\r\n\r\n2 Article I, section 3, clause I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 68\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mode of Electing the President\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nFriday, March 14, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTHE mode of appointment of the Chief Magistrate of the United\r\nStates is almost the only part of the system, of any consequence,\r\nwhich has escaped without severe censure, or which has received the\r\nslightest mark of approbation from its opponents. The most\r\nplausible of these, who has appeared in print, has even deigned to\r\nadmit that the election of the President is pretty well\r\nguarded.1 I venture somewhat further, and hesitate not to\r\naffirm, that if the manner of it be not perfect, it is at least\r\nexcellent. It unites in an eminent degree all the advantages, the\r\nunion of which was to be wished for.\r\n\r\nIt was desirable that the sense of the people should operate in\r\nthe choice of the person to whom so important a trust was to be\r\nconfided. This end will be answered by committing the right of\r\nmaking it, not to any preestablished body, but to men chosen by the\r\npeople for the special purpose, and at the particular conjuncture.\r\n\r\nIt was equally desirable, that the immediate election should be\r\nmade by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the\r\nstation, and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation,\r\nand to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements\r\nwhich were proper to govern their choice. A small number of\r\npersons, selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass,\r\nwill be most likely to possess the information and discernment\r\nrequisite to such complicated investigations.\r\n\r\nIt was also peculiarly desirable to afford as little opportunity\r\nas possible to tumult and disorder. This evil was not least to be\r\ndreaded in the election of a magistrate, who was to have so\r\nimportant an agency in the administration of the government as the\r\nPresident of the United States. But the precautions which have been\r\nso happily concerted in the system under consideration, promise an\r\neffectual security against this mischief. The choice of SEVERAL, to\r\nform an intermediate body of electors, will be much less apt to\r\nconvulse the community with any extraordinary or violent movements,\r\nthan the choice of ONE who was himself to be the final object of the\r\npublic wishes. And as the electors, chosen in each State, are to\r\nassemble and vote in the State in which they are chosen, this\r\ndetached and divided situation will expose them much less to heats\r\nand ferments, which might be communicated from them to the people,\r\nthan if they were all to be convened at one time, in one place.\r\n\r\nNothing was more to be desired than that every practicable\r\nobstacle should be opposed to cabal, intrigue, and corruption.\r\nThese most deadly adversaries of republican government might\r\nnaturally have been expected to make their approaches from more than\r\none quarter, but chiefly from the desire in foreign powers to gain\r\nan improper ascendant in our councils. How could they better\r\ngratify this, than by raising a creature of their own to the chief\r\nmagistracy of the Union? But the convention have guarded against\r\nall danger of this sort, with the most provident and judicious\r\nattention. They have not made the appointment of the President to\r\ndepend on any preexisting bodies of men, who might be tampered with\r\nbeforehand to prostitute their votes; but they have referred it in\r\nthe first instance to an immediate act of the people of America, to\r\nbe exerted in the choice of persons for the temporary and sole\r\npurpose of making the appointment. And they have excluded from\r\neligibility to this trust, all those who from situation might be\r\nsuspected of too great devotion to the President in office. No\r\nsenator, representative, or other person holding a place of trust or\r\nprofit under the United States, can be of the numbers of the\r\nelectors. Thus without corrupting the body of the people, the\r\nimmediate agents in the election will at least enter upon the task\r\nfree from any sinister bias. Their transient existence, and their\r\ndetached situation, already taken notice of, afford a satisfactory\r\nprospect of their continuing so, to the conclusion of it. The\r\nbusiness of corruption, when it is to embrace so considerable a\r\nnumber of men, requires time as well as means. Nor would it be\r\nfound easy suddenly to embark them, dispersed as they would be over\r\nthirteen States, in any combinations founded upon motives, which\r\nthough they could not properly be denominated corrupt, might yet be\r\nof a nature to mislead them from their duty.\r\n\r\nAnother and no less important desideratum was, that the\r\nExecutive should be independent for his continuance in office on all\r\nbut the people themselves. He might otherwise be tempted to\r\nsacrifice his duty to his complaisance for those whose favor was\r\nnecessary to the duration of his official consequence. This\r\nadvantage will also be secured, by making his re-election to depend\r\non a special body of representatives, deputed by the society for the\r\nsingle purpose of making the important choice.\r\n\r\nAll these advantages will happily combine in the plan devised by\r\nthe convention; which is, that the people of each State shall\r\nchoose a number of persons as electors, equal to the number of\r\nsenators and representatives of such State in the national\r\ngovernment, who shall assemble within the State, and vote for some\r\nfit person as President. Their votes, thus given, are to be\r\ntransmitted to the seat of the national government, and the person\r\nwho may happen to have a majority of the whole number of votes will\r\nbe the President. But as a majority of the votes might not always\r\nhappen to centre in one man, and as it might be unsafe to permit\r\nless than a majority to be conclusive, it is provided that, in such\r\na contingency, the House of Representatives shall select out of the\r\ncandidates who shall have the five highest number of votes, the man\r\nwho in their opinion may be best qualified for the office.\r\n\r\nThe process of election affords a moral certainty, that the\r\noffice of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not\r\nin an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications.\r\nTalents for low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity, may\r\nalone suffice to elevate a man to the first honors in a single\r\nState; but it will require other talents, and a different kind of\r\nmerit, to establish him in the esteem and confidence of the whole\r\nUnion, or of so considerable a portion of it as would be necessary\r\nto make him a successful candidate for the distinguished office of\r\nPresident of the United States. It will not be too strong to say,\r\nthat there will be a constant probability of seeing the station\r\nfilled by characters pre-eminent for ability and virtue. And this\r\nwill be thought no inconsiderable recommendation of the\r\nConstitution, by those who are able to estimate the share which the\r\nexecutive in every government must necessarily have in its good or\r\nill administration. Though we cannot acquiesce in the political\r\nheresy of the poet who says:  \"For forms of government let fools\r\ncontest That which is best  administered is best,\"\r\nyet we may safely pronounce, that the true test of a good\r\ngovernment is its aptitude and tendency to produce a good\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nThe Vice-President is to be chosen in the same manner with the\r\nPresident; with this difference, that the Senate is to do, in\r\nrespect to the former, what is to be done by the House of\r\nRepresentatives, in respect to the latter.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of an extraordinary person, as Vice-President,\r\nhas been objected to as superfluous, if not mischievous. It has\r\nbeen alleged, that it would have been preferable to have authorized\r\nthe Senate to elect out of their own body an officer answering that\r\ndescription. But two considerations seem to justify the ideas of\r\nthe convention in this respect. One is, that to secure at all times\r\nthe possibility of a definite resolution of the body, it is\r\nnecessary that the President should have only a casting vote. And\r\nto take the senator of any State from his seat as senator, to place\r\nhim in that of President of the Senate, would be to exchange, in\r\nregard to the State from which he came, a constant for a contingent\r\nvote. The other consideration is, that as the Vice-President may\r\noccasionally become a substitute for the President, in the supreme\r\nexecutive magistracy, all the reasons which recommend the mode of\r\nelection prescribed for the one, apply with great if not with equal\r\nforce to the manner of appointing the other. It is remarkable that\r\nin this, as in most other instances, the objection which is made\r\nwould lie against the constitution of this State. We have a\r\nLieutenant-Governor, chosen by the people at large, who presides in\r\nthe Senate, and is the constitutional substitute for the Governor,\r\nin casualties similar to those which would authorize the\r\nVice-President to exercise the authorities and discharge the duties\r\nof the President.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n1 Vide FEDERAL FARMER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 69\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Real Character of the Executive\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nFriday, March 14, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nI PROCEED now to trace the real characters of the proposed\r\nExecutive, as they are marked out in the plan of the convention.\r\nThis will serve to place in a strong light the unfairness of the\r\nrepresentations which have been made in regard to it.\r\n\r\nThe first thing which strikes our attention is, that the\r\nexecutive authority, with few exceptions, is to be vested in a\r\nsingle magistrate. This will scarcely, however, be considered as a\r\npoint upon which any comparison can be grounded; for if, in this\r\nparticular, there be a resemblance to the king of Great Britain,\r\nthere is not less a resemblance to the Grand Seignior, to the khan\r\nof Tartary, to the Man of the Seven Mountains, or to the governor of\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nThat magistrate is to be elected for FOUR years; and is to be\r\nre-eligible as often as the people of the United States shall think\r\nhim worthy of their confidence. In these circumstances there is a\r\ntotal dissimilitude between HIM and a king of Great Britain, who is\r\nan HEREDITARY monarch, possessing the crown as a patrimony\r\ndescendible to his heirs forever; but there is a close analogy\r\nbetween HIM and a governor of New York, who is elected for THREE\r\nyears, and is re-eligible without limitation or intermission. If we\r\nconsider how much less time would be requisite for establishing a\r\ndangerous influence in a single State, than for establishing a like\r\ninfluence throughout the United States, we must conclude that a\r\nduration of FOUR years for the Chief Magistrate of the Union is a\r\ndegree of permanency far less to be dreaded in that office, than a\r\nduration of THREE years for a corresponding office in a single State.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States would be liable to be\r\nimpeached, tried, and, upon conviction of treason, bribery, or other\r\nhigh crimes or misdemeanors, removed from office; and would\r\nafterwards be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary\r\ncourse of law. The person of the king of Great Britain is sacred\r\nand inviolable; there is no constitutional tribunal to which he is\r\namenable; no punishment to which he can be subjected without\r\ninvolving the crisis of a national revolution. In this delicate and\r\nimportant circumstance of personal responsibility, the President of\r\nConfederated America would stand upon no better ground than a\r\ngovernor of New York, and upon worse ground than the governors of\r\nMaryland and Delaware.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States is to have power to return a\r\nbill, which shall have passed the two branches of the legislature,\r\nfor reconsideration; and the bill so returned is to become a law,\r\nif, upon that reconsideration, it be approved by two thirds of both\r\nhouses. The king of Great Britain, on his part, has an absolute\r\nnegative upon the acts of the two houses of Parliament. The disuse\r\nof that power for a considerable time past does not affect the\r\nreality of its existence; and is to be ascribed wholly to the\r\ncrown's having found the means of substituting influence to\r\nauthority, or the art of gaining a majority in one or the other of\r\nthe two houses, to the necessity of exerting a prerogative which\r\ncould seldom be exerted without hazarding some degree of national\r\nagitation. The qualified negative of the President differs widely\r\nfrom this absolute negative of the British sovereign; and tallies\r\nexactly with the revisionary authority of the council of revision of\r\nthis State, of which the governor is a constituent part. In this\r\nrespect the power of the President would exceed that of the governor\r\nof New York, because the former would possess, singly, what the\r\nlatter shares with the chancellor and judges; but it would be\r\nprecisely the same with that of the governor of Massachusetts, whose\r\nconstitution, as to this article, seems to have been the original\r\nfrom which the convention have copied.\r\n\r\nThe President is to be the \"commander-in-chief of the army and\r\nnavy of the United States, and of the militia of the several States,\r\nwhen called into the actual service of the United States. He is to\r\nhave power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the\r\nUnited States, EXCEPT IN CASES OF IMPEACHMENT; to recommend to the\r\nconsideration of Congress such measures as he shall judge necessary\r\nand expedient; to convene, on extraordinary occasions, both houses\r\nof the legislature, or either of them, and, in case of disagreement\r\nbetween them WITH RESPECT TO THE TIME OF ADJOURNMENT, to adjourn\r\nthem to such time as he shall think proper; to take care that the\r\nlaws be faithfully executed; and to commission all officers of the\r\nUnited States.\" In most of these particulars, the power of the\r\nPresident will resemble equally that of the king of Great Britain\r\nand of the governor of New York. The most material points of\r\ndifference are these:  First. The President will have only the\r\noccasional command of such part of the militia of the nation as by\r\nlegislative provision may be called into the actual service of the\r\nUnion. The king of Great Britain and the governor of New York have\r\nat all times the entire command of all the militia within their\r\nseveral jurisdictions. In this article, therefore, the power of the\r\nPresident would be inferior to that of either the monarch or the\r\ngovernor. Secondly. The President is to be commander-in-chief\r\nof the army and navy of the United States. In this respect his\r\nauthority would be nominally the same with that of the king of Great\r\nBritain, but in substance much inferior to it. It would amount to\r\nnothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military\r\nand naval forces, as first General and admiral of the Confederacy;\r\nwhile that of the British king extends to the DECLARING of war and\r\nto the RAISING and REGULATING of fleets and armies, all which, by\r\nthe Constitution under consideration, would appertain to the\r\nlegislature.1 The governor of New York, on the other hand, is\r\nby the constitution of the State vested only with the command of its\r\nmilitia and navy. But the constitutions of several of the States\r\nexpressly declare their governors to be commanders-in-chief, as well\r\nof the army as navy; and it may well be a question, whether those\r\nof New Hampshire and Massachusetts, in particular, do not, in this\r\ninstance, confer larger powers upon their respective governors, than\r\ncould be claimed by a President of the United States. Thirdly.\r\nThe power of the President, in respect to pardons, would extend to\r\nall cases, EXCEPT THOSE OF IMPEACHMENT. The governor of New York\r\nmay pardon in all cases, even in those of impeachment, except for\r\ntreason and murder. Is not the power of the governor, in this\r\narticle, on a calculation of political consequences, greater than\r\nthat of the President? All conspiracies and plots against the\r\ngovernment, which have not been matured into actual treason, may be\r\nscreened from punishment of every kind, by the interposition of the\r\nprerogative of pardoning. If a governor of New York, therefore,\r\nshould be at the head of any such conspiracy, until the design had\r\nbeen ripened into actual hostility he could insure his accomplices\r\nand adherents an entire impunity. A President of the Union, on the\r\nother hand, though he may even pardon treason, when prosecuted in\r\nthe ordinary course of law, could shelter no offender, in any\r\ndegree, from the effects of impeachment and conviction. Would not\r\nthe prospect of a total indemnity for all the preliminary steps be a\r\ngreater temptation to undertake and persevere in an enterprise\r\nagainst the public liberty, than the mere prospect of an exemption\r\nfrom death and confiscation, if the final execution of the design,\r\nupon an actual appeal to arms, should miscarry? Would this last\r\nexpectation have any influence at all, when the probability was\r\ncomputed, that the person who was to afford that exemption might\r\nhimself be involved in the consequences of the measure, and might be\r\nincapacitated by his agency in it from affording the desired\r\nimpunity? The better to judge of this matter, it will be necessary\r\nto recollect, that, by the proposed Constitution, the offense of\r\ntreason is limited \"to levying war upon the United States, and\r\nadhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort\"; and that\r\nby the laws of New York it is confined within similar bounds.\r\nFourthly. The President can only adjourn the national legislature\r\nin the single case of disagreement about the time of adjournment.\r\nThe British monarch may prorogue or even dissolve the Parliament.\r\nThe governor of New York may also prorogue the legislature of this\r\nState for a limited time; a power which, in certain situations, may\r\nbe employed to very important purposes.\r\n\r\nThe President is to have power, with the advice and consent of\r\nthe Senate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the senators\r\npresent concur. The king of Great Britain is the sole and absolute\r\nrepresentative of the nation in all foreign transactions. He can of\r\nhis own accord make treaties of peace, commerce, alliance, and of\r\nevery other description. It has been insinuated, that his authority\r\nin this respect is not conclusive, and that his conventions with\r\nforeign powers are subject to the revision, and stand in need of the\r\nratification, of Parliament. But I believe this doctrine was never\r\nheard of, until it was broached upon the present occasion. Every\r\njurist2 of that kingdom, and every other man acquainted with its\r\nConstitution, knows, as an established fact, that the prerogative of\r\nmaking treaties exists in the crown in its utmost plentitude; and\r\nthat the compacts entered into by the royal authority have the most\r\ncomplete legal validity and perfection, independent of any other\r\nsanction. The Parliament, it is true, is sometimes seen employing\r\nitself in altering the existing laws to conform them to the\r\nstipulations in a new treaty; and this may have possibly given\r\nbirth to the imagination, that its co-operation was necessary to the\r\nobligatory efficacy of the treaty. But this parliamentary\r\ninterposition proceeds from a different cause: from the necessity\r\nof adjusting a most artificial and intricate system of revenue and\r\ncommercial laws, to the changes made in them by the operation of the\r\ntreaty; and of adapting new provisions and precautions to the new\r\nstate of things, to keep the machine from running into disorder. In\r\nthis respect, therefore, there is no comparison between the intended\r\npower of the President and the actual power of the British sovereign.\r\nThe one can perform alone what the other can do only with the\r\nconcurrence of a branch of the legislature. It must be admitted,\r\nthat, in this instance, the power of the federal Executive would\r\nexceed that of any State Executive. But this arises naturally from\r\nthe sovereign power which relates to treaties. If the Confederacy\r\nwere to be dissolved, it would become a question, whether the\r\nExecutives of the several States were not solely invested with that\r\ndelicate and important prerogative.\r\n\r\nThe President is also to be authorized to receive ambassadors\r\nand other public ministers. This, though it has been a rich theme\r\nof declamation, is more a matter of dignity than of authority. It\r\nis a circumstance which will be without consequence in the\r\nadministration of the government; and it was far more convenient\r\nthat it should be arranged in this manner, than that there should be\r\na necessity of convening the legislature, or one of its branches,\r\nupon every arrival of a foreign minister, though it were merely to\r\ntake the place of a departed predecessor.\r\n\r\nThe President is to nominate, and, WITH THE ADVICE AND CONSENT\r\nOF THE SENATE, to appoint ambassadors and other public ministers,\r\njudges of the Supreme Court, and in general all officers of the\r\nUnited States established by law, and whose appointments are not\r\notherwise provided for by the Constitution. The king of Great\r\nBritain is emphatically and truly styled the fountain of honor. He\r\nnot only appoints to all offices, but can create offices. He can\r\nconfer titles of nobility at pleasure; and has the disposal of an\r\nimmense number of church preferments. There is evidently a great\r\ninferiority in the power of the President, in this particular, to\r\nthat of the British king; nor is it equal to that of the governor\r\nof New York, if we are to interpret the meaning of the constitution\r\nof the State by the practice which has obtained under it. The power\r\nof appointment is with us lodged in a council, composed of the\r\ngovernor and four members of the Senate, chosen by the Assembly.\r\nThe governor CLAIMS, and has frequently EXERCISED, the right of\r\nnomination, and is ENTITLED to a casting vote in the appointment.\r\nIf he really has the right of nominating, his authority is in this\r\nrespect equal to that of the President, and exceeds it in the\r\narticle of the casting vote. In the national government, if the\r\nSenate should be divided, no appointment could be made; in the\r\ngovernment of New York, if the council should be divided, the\r\ngovernor can turn the scale, and confirm his own nomination.3\r\nIf we compare the publicity which must necessarily attend the mode\r\nof appointment by the President and an entire branch of the national\r\nlegislature, with the privacy in the mode of appointment by the\r\ngovernor of New York, closeted in a secret apartment with at most\r\nfour, and frequently with only two persons; and if we at the same\r\ntime consider how much more easy it must be to influence the small\r\nnumber of which a council of appointment consists, than the\r\nconsiderable number of which the national Senate would consist, we\r\ncannot hesitate to pronounce that the power of the chief magistrate\r\nof this State, in the disposition of offices, must, in practice, be\r\ngreatly superior to that of the Chief Magistrate of the Union.\r\n\r\nHence it appears that, except as to the concurrent authority of\r\nthe President in the article of treaties, it would be difficult to\r\ndetermine whether that magistrate would, in the aggregate, possess\r\nmore or less power than the Governor of New York. And it appears\r\nyet more unequivocally, that there is no pretense for the parallel\r\nwhich has been attempted between him and the king of Great Britain.\r\nBut to render the contrast in this respect still more striking, it\r\nmay be of use to throw the principal circumstances of dissimilitude\r\ninto a closer group.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States would be an officer elected\r\nby the people for FOUR years; the king of Great Britain is a\r\nperpetual and HEREDITARY prince. The one would be amenable to\r\npersonal punishment and disgrace; the person of the other is sacred\r\nand inviolable. The one would have a QUALIFIED negative upon the\r\nacts of the legislative body; the other has an ABSOLUTE negative.\r\nThe one would have a right to command the military and naval forces\r\nof the nation; the other, in addition to this right, possesses that\r\nof DECLARING war, and of RAISING and REGULATING fleets and armies by\r\nhis own authority. The one would have a concurrent power with a\r\nbranch of the legislature in the formation of treaties; the other\r\nis the SOLE POSSESSOR of the power of making treaties. The one\r\nwould have a like concurrent authority in appointing to offices;\r\nthe other is the sole author of all appointments. The one can\r\nconfer no privileges whatever; the other can make denizens of\r\naliens, noblemen of commoners; can erect corporations with all the\r\nrights incident to corporate bodies. The one can prescribe no rules\r\nconcerning the commerce or currency of the nation; the other is in\r\nseveral respects the arbiter of commerce, and in this capacity can\r\nestablish markets and fairs, can regulate weights and measures, can\r\nlay embargoes for a limited time, can coin money, can authorize or\r\nprohibit the circulation of foreign coin. The one has no particle\r\nof spiritual jurisdiction; the other is the supreme head and\r\ngovernor of the national church! What answer shall we give to those\r\nwho would persuade us that things so unlike resemble each other?\r\nThe same that ought to be given to those who tell us that a\r\ngovernment, the whole power of which would be in the hands of the\r\nelective and periodical servants of the people, is an aristocracy, a\r\nmonarchy, and a despotism.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n1 A writer in a Pennsylvania paper, under the signature of\r\nTAMONY, has asserted that the king of Great Britain owes his\r\nprerogative as commander-in-chief to an annual mutiny bill. The\r\ntruth is, on the contrary, that his prerogative, in this respect, is\r\nimmemorial, and was only disputed, \"contrary to all reason and\r\nprecedent,\" as Blackstone vol. i., page 262, expresses it, by the\r\nLong Parliament of Charles I. but by the statute the 13th of Charles\r\nII., chap. 6, it was declared to be in the king alone, for that the\r\nsole supreme government and command of the militia within his\r\nMajesty's realms and dominions, and of all forces by sea and land,\r\nand of all forts and places of strength, EVER WAS AND IS the\r\nundoubted right of his Majesty and his royal predecessors, kings and\r\nqueens of England, and that both or either house of Parliament\r\ncannot nor ought to pretend to the same.\r\n\r\n2 Vide Blackstone's \"Commentaries,\" vol i., p. 257.\r\n\r\n3 Candor, however, demands an acknowledgment that I do not think\r\nthe claim of the governor to a right of nomination well founded.\r\nYet it is always justifiable to reason from the practice of a\r\ngovernment, till its propriety has been constitutionally questioned.\r\nAnd independent of this claim, when we take into view the other\r\nconsiderations, and pursue them through all their consequences, we\r\nshall be inclined to draw much the same conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*There are two slightly different versions of No. 70 included here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 70\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Executive Department Further Considered\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, March 18, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTHERE is an idea, which is not without its advocates, that a\r\nvigorous Executive is inconsistent with the genius of republican\r\ngovernment. The enlightened well-wishers to this species of\r\ngovernment must at least hope that the supposition is destitute of\r\nfoundation; since they can never admit its truth, without at the\r\nsame time admitting the condemnation of their own principles.\r\nEnergy in the Executive is a leading character in the definition of\r\ngood government. It is essential to the protection of the community\r\nagainst foreign attacks; it is not less essential to the steady\r\nadministration of the laws; to the protection of property against\r\nthose irregular and high-handed combinations which sometimes\r\ninterrupt the ordinary course of justice; to the security of\r\nliberty against the enterprises and assaults of ambition, of\r\nfaction, and of anarchy. Every man the least conversant in Roman\r\nstory, knows how often that republic was obliged to take refuge in\r\nthe absolute power of a single man, under the formidable title of\r\nDictator, as well against the intrigues of ambitious individuals who\r\naspired to the tyranny, and the seditions of whole classes of the\r\ncommunity whose conduct threatened the existence of all government,\r\nas against the invasions of external enemies who menaced the\r\nconquest and destruction of Rome.\r\n\r\nThere can be no need, however, to multiply arguments or examples\r\non this head. A feeble Executive implies a feeble execution of the\r\ngovernment. A feeble execution is but another phrase for a bad\r\nexecution; and a government ill executed, whatever it may be in\r\ntheory, must be, in practice, a bad government.\r\n\r\nTaking it for granted, therefore, that all men of sense will\r\nagree in the necessity of an energetic Executive, it will only\r\nremain to inquire, what are the ingredients which constitute this\r\nenergy? How far can they be combined with those other ingredients\r\nwhich constitute safety in the republican sense? And how far does\r\nthis combination characterize the plan which has been reported by\r\nthe convention?\r\n\r\nThe ingredients which constitute energy in the Executive are,\r\nfirst, unity; secondly, duration; thirdly, an adequate provision\r\nfor its support; fourthly, competent powers.\r\n\r\nThe ingredients which constitute safety in the repub lican sense\r\nare, first, a due dependence on the people, secondly, a due\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nThose politicians and statesmen who have been the most\r\ncelebrated for the soundness of their principles and for the justice\r\nof their views, have declared in favor of a single Executive and a\r\nnumerous legislature. They have with great propriety, considered\r\nenergy as the most necessary qualification of the former, and have\r\nregarded this as most applicable to power in a single hand, while\r\nthey have, with equal propriety, considered the latter as best\r\nadapted to deliberation and wisdom, and best calculated to\r\nconciliate the confidence of the people and to secure their\r\nprivileges and interests.\r\n\r\nThat unity is conducive to energy will not be disputed.\r\nDecision, activity, secrecy, and despatch will generally\r\ncharacterize the proceedings of one man in a much more eminent\r\ndegree than the proceedings of any greater number; and in\r\nproportion as the number is increased, these qualities will be\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\nThis unity may be destroyed in two ways: either by vesting the\r\npower in two or more magistrates of equal dignity and authority; or\r\nby vesting it ostensibly in one man, subject, in whole or in part,\r\nto the control and co-operation of others, in the capacity of\r\ncounsellors to him. Of the first, the two Consuls of Rome may serve\r\nas an example; of the last, we shall find examples in the\r\nconstitutions of several of the States. New York and New Jersey, if\r\nI recollect right, are the only States which have intrusted the\r\nexecutive authority wholly to single men.1 Both these methods\r\nof destroying the unity of the Executive have their partisans; but\r\nthe votaries of an executive council are the most numerous. They\r\nare both liable, if not to equal, to similar objections, and may in\r\nmost lights be examined in conjunction.\r\n\r\nThe experience of other nations will afford little instruction\r\non this head. As far, however, as it teaches any thing, it teaches\r\nus not to be enamoured of plurality in the Executive. We have seen\r\nthat the Achaeans, on an experiment of two Praetors, were induced to\r\nabolish one. The Roman history records many instances of mischiefs\r\nto the republic from the dissensions between the Consuls, and\r\nbetween the military Tribunes, who were at times substituted for the\r\nConsuls. But it gives us no specimens of any peculiar advantages\r\nderived to the state from the circumstance of the plurality of those\r\nmagistrates. That the dissensions between them were not more\r\nfrequent or more fatal, is a matter of astonishment, until we advert\r\nto the singular position in which the republic was almost\r\ncontinually placed, and to the prudent policy pointed out by the\r\ncircumstances of the state, and pursued by the Consuls, of making a\r\ndivision of the government between them. The patricians engaged in\r\na perpetual struggle with the plebeians for the preservation of\r\ntheir ancient authorities and dignities; the Consuls, who were\r\ngenerally chosen out of the former body, were commonly united by the\r\npersonal interest they had in the defense of the privileges of their\r\norder. In addition to this motive of union, after the arms of the\r\nrepublic had considerably expanded the bounds of its empire, it\r\nbecame an established custom with the Consuls to divide the\r\nadministration between themselves by lot one of them remaining at\r\nRome to govern the city and its environs, the other taking the\r\ncommand in the more distant provinces. This expedient must, no\r\ndoubt, have had great influence in preventing those collisions and\r\nrivalships which might otherwise have embroiled the peace of the\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\nBut quitting the dim light of historical research, attaching\r\nourselves purely to the dictates of reason and good sense, we shall\r\ndiscover much greater cause to reject than to approve the idea of\r\nplurality in the Executive, under any modification whatever.\r\n\r\nWherever two or more persons are engaged in any common\r\nenterprise or pursuit, there is always danger of difference of\r\nopinion. If it be a public trust or office, in which they are\r\nclothed with equal dignity and authority, there is peculiar danger\r\nof personal emulation and even animosity. From either, and\r\nespecially from all these causes, the most bitter dissensions are\r\napt to spring. Whenever these happen, they lessen the\r\nrespectability, weaken the authority, and distract the plans and\r\noperation of those whom they divide. If they should unfortunately\r\nassail the supreme executive magistracy of a country, consisting of\r\na plurality of persons, they might impede or frustrate the most\r\nimportant measures of the government, in the most critical\r\nemergencies of the state. And what is still worse, they might split\r\nthe community into the most violent and irreconcilable factions,\r\nadhering differently to the different individuals who composed the\r\nmagistracy.\r\n\r\nMen often oppose a thing, merely because they have had no agency\r\nin planning it, or because it may have been planned by those whom\r\nthey dislike. But if they have been consulted, and have happened to\r\ndisapprove, opposition then becomes, in their estimation, an\r\nindispensable duty of self-love. They seem to think themselves\r\nbound in honor, and by all the motives of personal infallibility, to\r\ndefeat the success of what has been resolved upon contrary to their\r\nsentiments. Men of upright, benevolent tempers have too many\r\nopportunities of remarking, with horror, to what desperate lengths\r\nthis disposition is sometimes carried, and how often the great\r\ninterests of society are sacrificed to the vanity, to the conceit,\r\nand to the obstinacy of individuals, who have credit enough to make\r\ntheir passions and their caprices interesting to mankind. Perhaps\r\nthe question now before the public may, in its consequences, afford\r\nmelancholy proofs of the effects of this despicable frailty, or\r\nrather detestable vice, in the human character.\r\n\r\nUpon the principles of a free government, inconveniences from\r\nthe source just mentioned must necessarily be submitted to in the\r\nformation of the legislature; but it is unnecessary, and therefore\r\nunwise, to introduce them into the constitution of the Executive.\r\nIt is here too that they may be most pernicious. In the\r\nlegislature, promptitude of decision is oftener an evil than a\r\nbenefit. The differences of opinion, and the jarrings of parties in\r\nthat department of the government, though they may sometimes\r\nobstruct salutary plans, yet often promote deliberation and\r\ncircumspection, and serve to check excesses in the majority. When a\r\nresolution too is once taken, the opposition must be at an end.\r\nThat resolution is a law, and resistance to it punishable. But no\r\nfavorable circumstances palliate or atone for the disadvantages of\r\ndissension in the executive department. Here, they are pure and\r\nunmixed. There is no point at which they cease to operate. They\r\nserve to embarrass and weaken the execution of the plan or measure\r\nto which they relate, from the first step to the final conclusion of\r\nit. They constantly counteract those qualities in the Executive\r\nwhich are the most necessary ingredients in its composition, vigor\r\nand expedition, and this without anycounterbalancing good. In the\r\nconduct of war, in which the energy of the Executive is the bulwark\r\nof the national security, every thing would be to be apprehended\r\nfrom its plurality.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that these observations apply with\r\nprincipal weight to the first case supposed that is, to a plurality\r\nof magistrates of equal dignity and authority a scheme, the\r\nadvocates for which are not likely to form a numerous sect; but\r\nthey apply, though not with equal, yet with considerable weight to\r\nthe project of a council, whose concurrence is made constitutionally\r\nnecessary to the operations of the ostensible Executive. An artful\r\ncabal in that council would be able to distract and to enervate the\r\nwhole system of administration. If no such cabal should exist, the\r\nmere diversity of views and opinions would alone be sufficient to\r\ntincture the exercise of the executive authority with a spirit of\r\nhabitual feebleness and dilatoriness.\r\n\r\nBut one of the weightiest objections to a plurality in the\r\nExecutive, and which lies as much against the last as the first\r\nplan, is, that it tends to conceal faults and destroy responsibility.\r\nResponsibility is of two kinds to censure and to punishment. The\r\nfirst is the more important of the two, especially in an elective\r\noffice. Man, in public trust, will much oftener act in such a\r\nmanner as to render him unworthy of being any longer trusted, than\r\nin such a manner as to make him obnoxious to legal punishment. But\r\nthe multiplication of the Executive adds to the difficulty of\r\ndetection in either case. It often becomes impossible, amidst\r\nmutual accusations, to determine on whom the blame or the punishment\r\nof a pernicious measure, or series of pernicious measures, ought\r\nreally to fall. It is shifted from one to another with so much\r\ndexterity, and under such plausible appearances, that the public\r\nopinion is left in suspense about the real author. The\r\ncircumstances which may have led to any national miscarriage or\r\nmisfortune are sometimes so complicated that, where there are a\r\nnumber of actors who may have had different degrees and kinds of\r\nagency, though we may clearly see upon the whole that there has been\r\nmismanagement, yet it may be impracticable to pronounce to whose\r\naccount the evil which may have been incurred is truly chargeable.\r\n\r\n\"I was overruled by my council. The council were so divided in\r\ntheir opinions that it was impossible to obtain any better\r\nresolution on the point.\" These and similar pretexts are\r\nconstantly at hand, whether true or false. And who is there that\r\nwill either take the trouble or incur the odium, of a strict\r\nscrunity into the secret springs of the transaction? Should there\r\nbe found a citizen zealous enough to undertake the unpromising task,\r\nif there happen to be collusion between the parties concerned, how\r\neasy it is to clothe the circumstances with so much ambiguity, as to\r\nrender it uncertain what was the precise conduct of any of those\r\nparties?\r\n\r\nIn the single instance in which the governor of this State is\r\ncoupled with a council that is, in the appointment to offices, we\r\nhave seen the mischiefs of it in the view now under consideration.\r\nScandalous appointments to important offices have been made. Some\r\ncases, indeed, have been so flagrant that ALL PARTIES have agreed in\r\nthe impropriety of the thing. When inquiry has been made, the blame\r\nhas been laid by the governor on the members of the council, who, on\r\ntheir part, have charged it upon his nomination; while the people\r\nremain altogether at a loss to determine, by whose influence their\r\ninterests have been committed to hands so unqualified and so\r\nmanifestly improper. In tenderness to individuals, I forbear to\r\ndescend to particulars.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from these considerations, that the plurality of\r\nthe Executive tends to deprive the people of the two greatest\r\nsecurities they can have for the faithful exercise of any delegated\r\npower, first, the restraints of public opinion, which lose their\r\nefficacy, as well on account of the division of the censure\r\nattendant on bad measures among a number, as on account of the\r\nuncertainty on whom it ought to fall; and, secondly, the\r\nopportunity of discovering with facility and clearness the\r\nmisconduct of the persons they trust, in order either to their\r\nremoval from office or to their actual punishment in cases which\r\nadmit of it.\r\n\r\nIn England, the king is a perpetual magistrate; and it is a\r\nmaxim which has obtained for the sake of the pub lic peace, that he\r\nis unaccountable for his administration, and his person sacred.\r\nNothing, therefore, can be wiser in that kingdom, than to annex to\r\nthe king a constitutional council, who may be responsible to the\r\nnation for the advice they give. Without this, there would be no\r\nresponsibility whatever in the executive department an idea\r\ninadmissible in a free government. But even there the king is not\r\nbound by the resolutions of his council, though they are answerable\r\nfor the advice they give. He is the absolute master of his own\r\nconduct in the exercise of his office, and may observe or disregard\r\nthe counsel given to him at his sole discretion.\r\n\r\nBut in a republic, where every magistrate ought to be personally\r\nresponsible for his behavior in office the reason which in the\r\nBritish Constitution dictates the propriety of a council, not only\r\nceases to apply, but turns against the institution. In the monarchy\r\nof Great Britain, it furnishes a substitute for the prohibited\r\nresponsibility of the chief magistrate, which serves in some degree\r\nas a hostage to the national justice for his good behavior. In the\r\nAmerican republic, it would serve to destroy, or would greatly\r\ndiminish, the intended and necessary responsibility of the Chief\r\nMagistrate himself.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a council to the Executive, which has so generally\r\nobtained in the State constitutions, has been derived from that\r\nmaxim of republican jealousy which considers power as safer in the\r\nhands of a number of men than of a single man. If the maxim should\r\nbe admitted to be applicable to the case, I should contend that the\r\nadvantage on that side would not counterbalance the numerous\r\ndisadvantages on the opposite side. But I do not think the rule at\r\nall applicable to the executive power. I clearly concur in opinion,\r\nin this particular, with a writer whom the celebrated Junius\r\npronounces to be \"deep, solid, and ingenious,\" that \"the\r\nexecutive power is more easily confined when it is ONE\";2 that\r\nit is far more safe there should be a single object for the jealousy\r\nand watchfulness of the people; and, in a word, that all\r\nmultiplication of the Executive is rather dangerous than friendly to\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nA little consideration will satisfy us, that the species of\r\nsecurity sought for in the multiplication of the Executive, is\r\nnattainable. Numbers must be so great as to render combination\r\ndifficult, or they are rather a source of danger than of security.\r\nThe united credit and influence of several individuals must be more\r\nformidable to liberty, than the credit and influence of either of\r\nthem separately. When power, therefore, is placed in the hands of\r\nso small a number of men, as to admit of their interests and views\r\nbeing easily combined in a common enterprise, by an artful leader,\r\nit becomes more liable to abuse, and more dangerous when abused,\r\nthan if it be lodged in the hands of one man; who, from the very\r\ncircumstance of his being alone, will be more narrowly watched and\r\nmore readily suspected, and who cannot unite so great a mass of\r\ninfluence as when he is associated with others. The Decemvirs of\r\nRome, whose name denotes their number,3 were more to be dreaded\r\nin their usurpation than any ONE of them would have been. No person\r\nwould think of proposing an Executive much more numerous than that\r\nbody; from six to a dozen have been suggested for the number of the\r\ncouncil. The extreme of these numbers, is not too great for an easy\r\ncombination; and from such a combination America would have more to\r\nfear, than from the ambition of any single individual. A council to\r\na magistrate, who is himself responsible for what he does, are\r\ngenerally nothing better than a clog upon his good intentions, are\r\noften the instruments and accomplices of his bad and are almost\r\nalways a cloak to his faults.\r\n\r\nI forbear to dwell upon the subject of expense; though it be\r\nevident that if the council should be numerous enough to answer the\r\nprincipal end aimed at by the institution, the salaries of the\r\nmembers, who must be drawn from their homes to reside at the seat of\r\ngovernment, would form an item in the catalogue of public\r\nexpenditures too serious to be incurred for an object of equivocal\r\nutility. I will only add that, prior to the appearance of the\r\nConstitution, I rarely met with an intelligent man from any of the\r\nStates, who did not admit, as the result of experience, that the\r\nUNITY of the executive of this State was one of the best of the\r\ndistinguishing features of our constitution.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n1 New York has no council except for the single purpose of\r\nappointing to offices; New Jersey has a council whom the governor\r\nmay consult. But I think, from the terms of the constitution, their\r\nresolutions do not bind him.\r\n\r\n2 De Lolme.\r\n\r\n3 Ten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*There are two slightly different versions of No. 70 included here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 70\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Executive Department Further Considered\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, March 18, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTHERE is an idea, which is not without its advocates, that a\r\nvigorous Executive is inconsistent with the genius of republican\r\ngovernment.

When a\r\nresolution too is once taken, the opposition must be at an end.\r\nThat resolution is a law, and resistance to it punishable. But no\r\nfavorable circumstances palliate or atone for the disadvantages of\r\ndissension in the executive department. Here, they are pure and\r\nunmixed. There is no point at which they cease to operate. They\r\nserve to embarrass and weaken the execution of the plan or measure\r\nto which they relate, from the first step to the final conclusion of\r\nit. They constantly counteract those qualities in the Executive\r\nwhich are the most necessary ingredients in its composition, vigor\r\nand expedition, and this without anycounterbalancing good. In the\r\nconduct of war, in which the energy of the Executive is the bulwark\r\nof the national security, every thing would be to be apprehended\r\nfrom its plurality.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that these observations apply with\r\nprincipal weight to the first case supposed that is, to a plurality\r\nof magistrates of equal dignity and authority a scheme, the\r\nadvocates for which are not likely to form a numerous sect; but\r\nthey apply, though not with equal, yet with considerable weight to\r\nthe project of a council, whose concurrence is made constitutionally\r\nnecessary to the operations of the ostensible Executive. An artful\r\ncabal in that council would be able to distract and to enervate the\r\nwhole system of administration. If no such cabal should exist, the\r\nmere diversity of views and opinions would alone be sufficient to\r\ntincture the exercise of the executive authority with a spirit of\r\nhabitual feebleness and dilatoriness.\r\n\r\nBut one of the weightiest objections to a plurality in the\r\nExecutive, and which lies as much against the last as the first\r\nplan, is, that it tends to conceal faults and destroy responsibility.\r\n\r\nResponsibility is of two kinds to censure and to punishment. The\r\nfirst is the more important of the two, especially in an elective\r\noffice. Man, in public trust, will much oftener act in such a\r\nmanner as to render him unworthy of being any longer trusted, than\r\nin such a manner as to make him obnoxious to legal punishment. But\r\nthe multiplication of the Executive adds to the difficulty of\r\ndetection in either case. It often becomes impossible, amidst\r\nmutual accusations, to determine on whom the blame or the punishment\r\nof a pernicious measure, or series of pernicious measures, ought\r\nreally to fall. It is shifted from one to another with so much\r\ndexterity, and under such plausible appearances, that the public\r\nopinion is left in suspense about the real author. The\r\ncircumstances which may have led to any national miscarriage or\r\nmisfortune are sometimes so complicated that, where there are a\r\nnumber of actors who may have had different degrees and kinds of\r\nagency, though we may clearly see upon the whole that there has been\r\nmismanagement, yet it may be impracticable to pronounce to whose\r\naccount the evil which may have been incurred is truly chargeable.\r\n\r\n\"I was overruled by my council. The council were so divided in\r\ntheir opinions that it was impossible to obtain any better\r\nresolution on the point.\" These and similar pretexts are\r\nconstantly at hand, whether true or false. And who is there that\r\nwill either take the trouble or incur the odium, of a strict\r\nscrunity into the secret springs of the transaction? Should there\r\nbe found a citizen zealous enough to undertake the unpromising task,\r\nif there happen to be collusion between the parties concerned, how\r\neasy it is to clothe the circumstances with so much ambiguity, as to\r\nrender it uncertain what was the precise conduct of any of those\r\nparties?\r\n\r\nIn the single instance in which the governor of this State is\r\ncoupled with a council that is, in the appointment to offices, we\r\nhave seen the mischiefs of it in the view now under consideration.\r\nScandalous appointments to important offices have been made. Some\r\ncases, indeed, have been so flagrant that ALL PARTIES have agreed in\r\nthe impropriety of the thing. When inquiry has been made, the blame\r\nhas been laid by the governor on the members of the council, who, on\r\ntheir part, have charged it upon his nomination; while the people\r\nremain altogether at a loss to determine, by whose influence their\r\ninterests have been committed to hands so unqualified and so\r\nmanifestly improper. In tenderness to individuals, I forbear to\r\ndescend to particulars.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from these considerations, that the plurality of\r\nthe Executive tends to deprive the people of the two greatest\r\nsecurities they can have for the faithful exercise of any delegated\r\npower, first, the restraints of public opinion, which lose their\r\nefficacy, as well on account of the division of the censure\r\nattendant on bad measures among a number, as on account of the\r\nuncertainty on whom it ought to fall; and, secondly, the\r\nopportunity of discovering with facility and clearness the\r\nmisconduct of the persons they trust, in order either to their\r\nremoval from office or to their actual punishment in cases which\r\nadmit of it.\r\n\r\nIn England, the king is a perpetual magistrate; and it is a\r\nmaxim which has obtained for the sake of the pub lic peace, that he\r\nis unaccountable for his administration, and his person sacred.\r\nNothing, therefore, can be wiser in that kingdom, than to annex to\r\nthe king a constitutional council, who may be responsible to the\r\nnation for the advice they give. Without this, there would be no\r\nresponsibility whatever in the executive department an idea\r\ninadmissible in a free government. But even there the king is not\r\nbound by the resolutions of his council, though they are answerable\r\nfor the advice they give. He is the absolute master of his own\r\nconduct in the exercise of his office, and may observe or disregard\r\nthe counsel given to him at his sole discretion.\r\n\r\nBut in a republic, where every magistrate ought to be personally\r\nresponsible for his behavior in office the reason which in the\r\nBritish Constitution dictates the propriety of a council, not only\r\nceases to apply, but turns against the institution. In the monarchy\r\nof Great Britain, it furnishes a substitute for the prohibited\r\nresponsibility of the chief magistrate, which serves in some degree\r\nas a hostage to the national justice for his good behavior. In the\r\nAmerican republic, it would serve to destroy, or would greatly\r\ndiminish, the intended and necessary responsibility of the Chief\r\nMagistrate himself.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a council to the Executive, which has so generally\r\nobtained in the State constitutions, has been derived from that\r\nmaxim of republican jealousy which considers power as safer in the\r\nhands of a number of men than of a single man. If the maxim should\r\nbe admitted to be applicable to the case, I should contend that the\r\nadvantage on that side would not counterbalance the numerous\r\ndisadvantages on the opposite side. But I do not think the rule at\r\nall applicable to the executive power. I clearly concur in opinion,\r\nin this particular, with a writer whom the celebrated Junius\r\npronounces to be \"deep, solid, and ingenious,\" that \"the\r\nexecutive power is more easily confined when it is ONE\";2 that\r\nit is far more safe there should be a single object for the jealousy\r\nand watchfulness of the people; and, in a word, that all\r\nmultiplication of the Executive is rather dangerous than friendly to\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nA little consideration will satisfy us, that the species of\r\nsecurity sought for in the multiplication of the Executive, is\r\nnattainable. Numbers must be so great as to render combination\r\ndifficult, or they are rather a source of danger than of security.\r\nThe united credit and influence of several individuals must be more\r\nformidable to liberty, than the credit and influence of either of\r\nthem separately. When power, therefore, is placed in the hands of\r\nso small a number of men, as to admit of their interests and views\r\nbeing easily combined in a common enterprise, by an artful leader,\r\nit becomes more liable to abuse, and more dangerous when abused,\r\nthan if it be lodged in the hands of one man; who, from the very\r\ncircumstance of his being alone, will be more narrowly watched and\r\nmore readily suspected, and who cannot unite so great a mass of\r\ninfluence as when he is associated with others. The Decemvirs of\r\nRome, whose name denotes their number,3 were more to be dreaded\r\nin their usurpation than any ONE of them would have been. No person\r\nwould think of proposing an Executive much more numerous than that\r\nbody; from six to a dozen have been suggested for the number of the\r\ncouncil. The extreme of these numbers, is not too great for an easy\r\ncombination; and from such a combination America would have more to\r\nfear, than from the ambition of any single individual. A council to\r\na magistrate, who is himself responsible for what he does, are\r\ngenerally nothing better than a clog upon his good intentions, are\r\noften the instruments and accomplices of his bad and are almost\r\nalways a cloak to his faults.\r\n\r\nI forbear to dwell upon the subject of expense; though it be\r\nevident that if the council should be numerous enough to answer the\r\nprincipal end aimed at by the institution, the salaries of the\r\nmembers, who must be drawn from their homes to reside at the seat of\r\ngovernment, would form an item in the catalogue of public\r\nexpenditures too serious to be incurred for an object of equivocal\r\nutility. I will only add that, prior to the appearance of the\r\nConstitution, I rarely met with an intelligent man from any of the\r\nStates, who did not admit, as the result of experience, that the\r\nUNITY of the executive of this State was one of the best of the\r\ndistinguishing features of our constitution.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n1 New York has no council except for the single purpose of\r\nappointing to offices; New Jersey has a council whom the governor\r\nmay consult. But I think, from the terms of the constitution, their\r\nresolutions do not bind him.\r\n\r\n2 De Lolme.\r\n\r\n3 Ten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 71\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duration in Office of the Executive\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, March 18, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nDURATION in office has been mentioned as the second requisite to\r\nthe energy of the Executive authority. This has relation to two\r\nobjects: to the personal firmness of the executive magistrate, in\r\nthe employment of his constitutional powers; and to the stability\r\nof the system of administration which may have been adopted under\r\nhis auspices. With regard to the first, it must be evident, that\r\nthe longer the duration in office, the greater will be the\r\nprobability of obtaining so important an advantage. It is a general\r\nprinciple of human nature, that a man will be interested in whatever\r\nhe possesses, in proportion to the firmness or precariousness of the\r\ntenure by which he holds it; will be less attached to what he holds\r\nby a momentary or uncertain title, than to what he enjoys by a\r\ndurable or certain title; and, of course, will be willing to risk\r\nmore for the sake of the one, than for the sake of the other. This\r\nremark is not less applicable to a political privilege, or honor, or\r\ntrust, than to any article of ordinary property. The inference from\r\nit is, that a man acting in the capacity of chief magistrate, under\r\na consciousness that in a very short time he MUST lay down his\r\noffice, will be apt to feel himself too little interested in it to\r\nhazard any material censure or perplexity, from the independent\r\nexertion of his powers, or from encountering the ill-humors, however\r\ntransient, which may happen to prevail, either in a considerable\r\npart of the society itself, or even in a predominant faction in the\r\nlegislative body. If the case should only be, that he MIGHT lay it\r\ndown, unless continued by a new choice, and if he should be desirous\r\nof being continued, his wishes, conspiring with his fears, would\r\ntend still more powerfully to corrupt his integrity, or debase his\r\nfortitude. In either case, feebleness and irresolution must be the\r\ncharacteristics of the station.\r\n\r\nThere are some who would be inclined to regard the servile\r\npliancy of the Executive to a prevailing current, either in the\r\ncommunity or in the legislature, as its best recommendation. But\r\nsuch men entertain very crude notions, as well of the purposes for\r\nwhich government was instituted, as of the true means by which the\r\npublic happiness may be promoted. The republican principle demands\r\nthat the deliberate sense of the community should govern the conduct\r\nof those to whom they intrust the management of their affairs; but\r\nit does not require an unqualified complaisance to every sudden\r\nbreeze of passion, or to every transient impulse which the people\r\nmay receive from the arts of men, who flatter their prejudices to\r\nbetray their interests. It is a just observation, that the people\r\ncommonly INTEND the PUBLIC GOOD. This often applies to their very\r\nerrors. But their good sense would despise the adulator who should\r\npretend that they always REASON RIGHT about the MEANS of promoting\r\nit. They know from experience that they sometimes err; and the\r\nwonder is that they so seldom err as they do, beset, as they\r\ncontinually are, by the wiles of parasites and sycophants, by the\r\nsnares of the ambitious, the avaricious, the desperate, by the\r\nartifices of men who possess their confidence more than they deserve\r\nit, and of those who seek to possess rather than to deserve it.\r\nWhen occasions present themselves, in which the interests of the\r\npeople are at variance with their inclinations, it is the duty of\r\nthe persons whom they have appointed to be the guardians of those\r\ninterests, to withstand the temporary delusion, in order to give\r\nthem time and opportunity for more cool and sedate reflection.\r\nInstances might be cited in which a conduct of this kind has saved\r\nthe people from very fatal consequences of their own mistakes, and\r\nhas procured lasting monuments of their gratitude to the men who had\r\ncourage and magnanimity enough to serve them at the peril of their\r\ndispleasure.\r\n\r\nBut however inclined we might be to insist upon an unbounded\r\ncomplaisance in the Executive to the inclinations of the people, we\r\ncan with no propriety contend for a like complaisance to the humors\r\nof the legislature. The latter may sometimes stand in opposition to\r\nthe former, and at other times the people may be entirely neutral.\r\nIn either supposition, it is certainly desirable that the Executive\r\nshould be in a situation to dare to act his own opinion with vigor\r\nand decision.\r\n\r\nThe same rule which teaches the propriety of a partition between\r\nthe various branches of power, teaches us likewise that this\r\npartition ought to be so contrived as to render the one independent\r\nof the other. To what purpose separate the executive or the\r\njudiciary from the legislative, if both the executive and the\r\njudiciary are so constituted as to be at the absolute devotion of\r\nthe legislative? Such a separation must be merely nominal, and\r\nincapable of producing the ends for which it was established. It is\r\none thing to be subordinate to the laws, and another to be dependent\r\non the legislative body. The first comports with, the last\r\nviolates, the fundamental principles of good government; and,\r\nwhatever may be the forms of the Constitution, unites all power in\r\nthe same hands. The tendency of the legislative authority to absorb\r\nevery other, has been fully displayed and illustrated by examples in\r\nsome preceding numbers. In governments purely republican, this\r\ntendency is almost irresistible. The representatives of the people,\r\nin a popular assembly, seem sometimes to fancy that they are the\r\npeople themselves, and betray strong symptoms of impatience and\r\ndisgust at the least sign of opposition from any other quarter; as\r\nif the exercise of its rights, by either the executive or judiciary,\r\nwere a breach of their privilege and an outrage to their dignity.\r\nThey often appear disposed to exert an imperious control over the\r\nother departments; and as they commonly have the people on their\r\nside, they always act with such momentum as to make it very\r\ndifficult for the other members of the government to maintain the\r\nbalance of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be asked, how the shortness of the duration in\r\noffice can affect the independence of the Executive on the\r\nlegislature, unless the one were possessed of the power of\r\nappointing or displacing the other. One answer to this inquiry may\r\nbe drawn from the principle already remarked that is, from the\r\nslender interest a man is apt to take in a short-lived advantage,\r\nand the little inducement it affords him to expose himself, on\r\naccount of it, to any considerable inconvenience or hazard. Another\r\nanswer, perhaps more obvious, though not more conclusive, will\r\nresult from the consideration of the influence of the legislative\r\nbody over the people; which might be employed to prevent the\r\nre-election of a man who, by an upright resistance to any sinister\r\nproject of that body, should have made himself obnoxious to its\r\nresentment.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked also, whether a duration of four years would\r\nanswer the end proposed; and if it would not, whether a less\r\nperiod, which would at least be recommended by greater security\r\nagainst ambitious designs, would not, for that reason, be preferable\r\nto a longer period, which was, at the same time, too short for the\r\npurpose of inspiring the desired firmness and independence of the\r\nmagistrate.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be affirmed, that a duration of four years, or any\r\nother limited duration, would completely answer the end proposed;\r\nbut it would contribute towards it in a degree which would have a\r\nmaterial influence upon the spirit and character of the government.\r\nBetween the commencement and termination of such a period, there\r\nwould always be a considerable interval, in which the prospect of\r\nannihilation would be sufficiently remote, not to have an improper\r\neffect upon the conduct of a man indued with a tolerable portion of\r\nfortitude; and in which he might reasonably promise himself, that\r\nthere would be time enough before it arrived, to make the community\r\nsensible of the propriety of the measures he might incline to pursue.\r\nThough it be probable that, as he approached the moment when the\r\npublic were, by a new election, to signify their sense of his\r\nconduct, his confidence, and with it his firmness, would decline;\r\nyet both the one and the other would derive support from the\r\nopportunities which his previous continuance in the station had\r\nafforded him, of establishing himself in the esteem and good-will of\r\nhis constituents. He might, then, hazard with safety, in proportion\r\nto the proofs he had given of his wisdom and integrity, and to the\r\ntitle he had acquired to the respect and attachment of his\r\nfellow-citizens. As, on the one hand, a duration of four years will\r\ncontribute to the firmness of the Executive in a sufficient degree\r\nto render it a very valuable ingredient in the composition; so, on\r\nthe other, it is not enough to justify any alarm for the public\r\nliberty. If a British House of Commons, from the most feeble\r\nbeginnings, FROM THE MERE POWER OF ASSENTING OR DISAGREEING TO THE\r\nIMPOSITION OF A NEW TAX, have, by rapid strides, reduced the\r\nprerogatives of the crown and the privileges of the nobility within\r\nthe limits they conceived to be compatible with the principles of a\r\nfree government, while they raised themselves to the rank and\r\nconsequence of a coequal branch of the legislature; if they have\r\nbeen able, in one instance, to abolish both the royalty and the\r\naristocracy, and to overturn all the ancient establishments, as well\r\nin the Church as State; if they have been able, on a recent\r\noccasion, to make the monarch tremble at the prospect of an\r\ninnovation1 attempted by them, what would be to be feared from\r\nan elective magistrate of four years' duration, with the confined\r\nauthorities of a President of the United States? What, but that he\r\nmight be unequal to the task which the Constitution assigns him? I\r\nshall only add, that if his duration be such as to leave a doubt of\r\nhis firmness, that doubt is inconsistent with a jealousy of his\r\nencroachments.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n1 This was the case with respect to Mr. Fox's India bill, which\r\nwas carried in the House of Commons, and rejected in the House of\r\nLords, to the entire satisfaction, as it is said, of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 72\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Same Subject Continued, and Re-Eligibility of the Executive\r\nConsidered\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nFriday, March 21, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTHE administration of government, in its largest sense,\r\ncomprehends all the operations of the body politic, whether\r\nlegislative, executive, or judiciary; but in its most usual, and\r\nperhaps its most precise signification. It is limited to executive\r\ndetails, and falls peculiarly within the province of the executive\r\ndepartment. The actual conduct of foreign negotiations, the\r\npreparatory plans of finance, the application and disbursement of\r\nthe public moneys in conformity to the general appropriations of the\r\nlegislature, the arrangement of the army and navy, the directions of\r\nthe operations of war, these, and other matters of a like nature,\r\nconstitute what seems to be most properly understood by the\r\nadministration of government. The persons, therefore, to whose\r\nimmediate management these different matters are committed, ought to\r\nbe considered as the assistants or deputies of the chief magistrate,\r\nand on this account, they ought to derive their offices from his\r\nappointment, at least from his nomination, and ought to be subject\r\nto his superintendence. This view of the subject will at once\r\nsuggest to us the intimate connection between the duration of the\r\nexecutive magistrate in office and the stability of the system of\r\nadministration. To reverse and undo what has been done by a\r\npredecessor, is very often considered by a successor as the best\r\nproof he can give of his own capacity and desert; and in addition\r\nto this propensity, where the alteration has been the result of\r\npublic choice, the person substituted is warranted in supposing that\r\nthe dismission of his predecessor has proceeded from a dislike to\r\nhis measures; and that the less he resembles him, the more he will\r\nrecommend himself to the favor of his constituents. These\r\nconsiderations, and the influence of personal confidences and\r\nattachments, would be likely to induce every new President to\r\npromote a change of men to fill the subordinate stations; and these\r\ncauses together could not fail to occasion a disgraceful and ruinous\r\nmutability in the administration of the government.\r\n\r\nWith a positive duration of considerable extent, I connect the\r\ncircumstance of re-eligibility. The first is necessary to give to\r\nthe officer himself the inclination and the resolution to act his\r\npart well, and to the community time and leisure to observe the\r\ntendency of his measures, and thence to form an experimental\r\nestimate of their merits. The last is necessary to enable the\r\npeople, when they see reason to approve of his conduct, to continue\r\nhim in his station, in order to prolong the utility of his talents\r\nand virtues, and to secure to the government the advantage of\r\npermanency in a wise system of administration.\r\n\r\nNothing appears more plausible at first sight, nor more\r\nill-founded upon close inspection, than a scheme which in relation\r\nto the present point has had some respectable advocates, I mean that\r\nof continuing the chief magistrate in office for a certain time, and\r\nthen excluding him from it, either for a limited period or forever\r\nafter. This exclusion, whether temporary or perpetual, would have\r\nnearly the same effects, and these effects would be for the most\r\npart rather pernicious than salutary.\r\n\r\nOne ill effect of the exclusion would be a diminution of the\r\ninducements to good behavior. There are few men who would not feel\r\nmuch less zeal in the discharge of a duty when they were conscious\r\nthat the advantages of the station with which it was connected must\r\nbe relinquished at a determinate period, than when they were\r\npermitted to entertain a hope of OBTAINING, by MERITING, a\r\ncontinuance of them. This position will not be disputed so long as\r\nit is admitted that the desire of reward is one of the strongest\r\nincentives of human conduct; or that the best security for the\r\nfidelity of mankind is to make their interests coincide with their\r\nduty. Even the love of fame, the ruling passion of the noblest\r\nminds, which would prompt a man to plan and undertake extensive and\r\narduous enterprises for the public benefit, requiring considerable\r\ntime to mature and perfect them, if he could flatter himself with\r\nthe prospect of being allowed to finish what he had begun, would, on\r\nthe contrary, deter him from the undertaking, when he foresaw that\r\nhe must quit the scene before he could accomplish the work, and must\r\ncommit that, together with his own reputation, to hands which might\r\nbe unequal or unfriendly to the task. The most to be expected from\r\nthe generality of men, in such a situation, is the negative merit of\r\nnot doing harm, instead of the positive merit of doing good.\r\n\r\nAnother ill effect of the exclusion would be the temptation to\r\nsordid views, to peculation, and, in some instances, to usurpation.\r\nAn avaricious man, who might happen to fill the office, looking\r\nforward to a time when he must at all events yield up the emoluments\r\nhe enjoyed, would feel a propensity, not easy to be resisted by such\r\na man, to make the best use of the opportunity he enjoyed while it\r\nlasted, and might not scruple to have recourse to the most corrupt\r\nexpedients to make the harvest as abundant as it was transitory;\r\nthough the same man, probably, with a different prospect before\r\nhim, might content himself with the regular perquisites of his\r\nsituation, and might even be unwilling to risk the consequences of\r\nan abuse of his opportunities. His avarice might be a guard upon\r\nhis avarice. Add to this that the same man might be vain or\r\nambitious, as well as avaricious. And if he could expect to prolong\r\nhis honors by his good conduct, he might hesitate to sacrifice his\r\nappetite for them to his appetite for gain. But with the prospect\r\nbefore him of approaching an inevitable annihilation, his avarice\r\nwould be likely to get the victory over his caution, his vanity, or\r\nhis ambition.\r\n\r\nAn ambitious man, too, when he found himself seated on the\r\nsummit of his country's honors, when he looked forward to the time\r\nat which he must descend from the exalted eminence for ever, and\r\nreflected that no exertion of merit on his part could save him from\r\nthe unwelcome reverse; such a man, in such a situation, would be\r\nmuch more violently tempted to embrace a favorable conjuncture for\r\nattempting the prolongation of his power, at every personal hazard,\r\nthan if he had the probability of answering the same end by doing\r\nhis duty.\r\n\r\nWould it promote the peace of the community, or the stability of\r\nthe government to have half a dozen men who had had credit enough to\r\nbe raised to the seat of the supreme magistracy, wandering among the\r\npeople like discontented ghosts, and sighing for a place which they\r\nwere destined never more to possess?\r\n\r\nA third ill effect of the exclusion would be, the depriving the\r\ncommunity of the advantage of the experience gained by the chief\r\nmagistrate in the exercise of his office. That experience is the\r\nparent of wisdom, is an adage the truth of which is recognized by\r\nthe wisest as well as the simplest of mankind. What more desirable\r\nor more essential than this quality in the governors of nations?\r\nWhere more desirable or more essential than in the first magistrate\r\nof a nation? Can it be wise to put this desirable and essential\r\nquality under the ban of the Constitution, and to declare that the\r\nmoment it is acquired, its possessor shall be compelled to abandon\r\nthe station in which it was acquired, and to which it is adapted?\r\nThis, nevertheless, is the precise import of all those regulations\r\nwhich exclude men from serving their country, by the choice of their\r\nfellowcitizens, after they have by a course of service fitted\r\nthemselves for doing it with a greater degree of utility.\r\n\r\nA fourth ill effect of the exclusion would be the banishing men\r\nfrom stations in which, in certain emergencies of the state, their\r\npresence might be of the greatest moment to the public interest or\r\nsafety. There is no nation which has not, at one period or another,\r\nexperienced an absolute necessity of the services of particular men\r\nin particular situations; perhaps it would not be too strong to\r\nsay, to the preservation of its political existence. How unwise,\r\ntherefore, must be every such self-denying ordinance as serves to\r\nprohibit a nation from making use of its own citizens in the manner\r\nbest suited to its exigencies and circumstances! Without supposing\r\nthe personal essentiality of the man, it is evident that a change of\r\nthe chief magistrate, at the breaking out of a war, or at any\r\nsimilar crisis, for another, even of equal merit, would at all times\r\nbe detrimental to the community, inasmuch as it would substitute\r\ninexperience to experience, and would tend to unhinge and set afloat\r\nthe already settled train of the administration.\r\n\r\nA fifth ill effect of the exclusion would be, that it would\r\noperate as a constitutional interdiction of stability in the\r\nadministration. By NECESSITATING a change of men, in the first\r\noffice of the nation, it would necessitate a mutability of measures.\r\nIt is not generally to be expected, that men will vary and measures\r\nremain uniform. The contrary is the usual course of things. And we\r\nneed not be apprehensive that there will be too much stability,\r\nwhile there is even the option of changing; nor need we desire to\r\nprohibit the people from continuing their confidence where they\r\nthink it may be safely placed, and where, by constancy on their\r\npart, they may obviate the fatal inconveniences of fluctuating\r\ncouncils and a variable policy.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the disadvantages which would flow from the\r\nprinciple of exclusion. They apply most forcibly to the scheme of a\r\nperpetual exclusion; but when we consider that even a partial\r\nexclusion would always render the readmission of the person a remote\r\nand precarious object, the observations which have been made will\r\napply nearly as fully to one case as to the other.\r\n\r\nWhat are the advantages promised to counterbalance these\r\ndisadvantages? They are represented to be: 1st, greater\r\nindependence in the magistrate; 2d, greater security to the people.\r\nUnless the exclusion be perpetual, there will be no pretense to\r\ninfer the first advantage. But even in that case, may he have no\r\nobject beyond his present station, to which he may sacrifice his\r\nindependence? May he have no connections, no friends, for whom he\r\nmay sacrifice it? May he not be less willing by a firm conduct, to\r\nmake personal enemies, when he acts under the impression that a time\r\nis fast approaching, on the arrival of which he not only MAY, but\r\nMUST, be exposed to their resentments, upon an equal, perhaps upon\r\nan inferior, footing? It is not an easy point to determine whether\r\nhis independence would be most promoted or impaired by such an\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nAs to the second supposed advantage, there is still greater\r\nreason to entertain doubts concerning it. If the exclusion were to\r\nbe perpetual, a man of irregular ambition, of whom alone there could\r\nbe reason in any case to entertain apprehension, would, with\r\ninfinite reluctance, yield to the necessity of taking his leave\r\nforever of a post in which his passion for power and pre-eminence\r\nhad acquired the force of habit. And if he had been fortunate or\r\nadroit enough to conciliate the good-will of the people, he might\r\ninduce them to consider as a very odious and unjustifiable restraint\r\nupon themselves, a provision which was calculated to debar them of\r\nthe right of giving a fresh proof of their attachment to a favorite.\r\nThere may be conceived circumstances in which this disgust of the\r\npeople, seconding the thwarted ambition of such a favorite, might\r\noccasion greater danger to liberty, than could ever reasonably be\r\ndreaded from the possibility of a perpetuation in office, by the\r\nvoluntary suffrages of the community, exercising a constitutional\r\nprivilege.\r\n\r\nThere is an excess of refinement in the idea of disabling the\r\npeople to continue in office men who had entitled themselves, in\r\ntheir opinion, to approbation and confidence; the advantages of\r\nwhich are at best speculative and equivocal, and are overbalanced by\r\ndisadvantages far more certain and decisive.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 73\r\n\r\nThe Provision For The Support of the Executive, and the Veto Power\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nFriday, March 21, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTHE third ingredient towards constituting the vigor of the\r\nexecutive authority, is an adequate provision for its support. It\r\nis evident that, without proper attention to this article, the\r\nseparation of the executive from the legislative department would be\r\nmerely nominal and nugatory. The legislature, with a discretionary\r\npower over the salary and emoluments of the Chief Magistrate, could\r\nrender him as obsequious to their will as they might think proper to\r\nmake him. They might, in most cases, either reduce him by famine,\r\nor tempt him by largesses, to surrender at discretion his judgment\r\nto their inclinations. These expressions, taken in all the latitude\r\nof the terms, would no doubt convey more than is intended. There\r\nare men who could neither be distressed nor won into a sacrifice of\r\ntheir duty; but this stern virtue is the growth of few soils; and\r\nin the main it will be found that a power over a man's support is a\r\npower over his will. If it were necessary to confirm so plain a\r\ntruth by facts, examples would not be wanting, even in this country,\r\nof the intimidation or seduction of the Executive by the terrors or\r\nallurements of the pecuniary arrangements of the legislative body.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy, therefore, to commend too highly the judicious\r\nattention which has been paid to this subject in the proposed\r\nConstitution. It is there provided that \"The President of the\r\nUnited States shall, at stated times, receive for his services a\r\ncompensation WHICH SHALL NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED DURING\r\nTHE PERIOD FOR WHICH HE SHALL HAVE BEEN ELECTED; and he SHALL NOT\r\nRECEIVE WITHIN THAT PERIOD ANY OTHER EMOLUMENT from the United\r\nStates, or any of them.\" It is impossible to imagine any provision\r\nwhich would have been more eligible than this. The legislature, on\r\nthe appointment of a President, is once for all to declare what\r\nshall be the compensation for his services during the time for which\r\nhe shall have been elected. This done, they will have no power to\r\nalter it, either by increase or diminution, till a new period of\r\nservice by a new election commences. They can neither weaken his\r\nfortitude by operating on his necessities, nor corrupt his integrity\r\nby appealing to his avarice. Neither the Union, nor any of its\r\nmembers, will be at liberty to give, nor will he be at liberty to\r\nreceive, any other emolument than that which may have been\r\ndetermined by the first act. He can, of course, have no pecuniary\r\ninducement to renounce or desert the independence intended for him\r\nby the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe last of the requisites to energy, which have been\r\nenumerated, are competent powers. Let us proceed to consider those\r\nwhich are proposed to be vested in the President of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that offers itself to our observation, is the\r\nqualified negative of the President upon the acts or resolutions of\r\nthe two houses of the legislature; or, in other words, his power of\r\nreturning all bills with objections, to have the effect of\r\npreventing their becoming laws, unless they should afterwards be\r\nratified by two thirds of each of the component members of the\r\nlegislative body.\r\n\r\nThe propensity of the legislative department to intrude upon the\r\nrights, and to absorb the powers, of the other departments, has been\r\nalready suggested and repeated; the insufficiency of a mere\r\nparchment delineation of the boundaries of each, has also been\r\nremarked upon; and the necessity of furnishing each with\r\nconstitutional arms for its own defense, has been inferred and\r\nproved. From these clear and indubitable principles results the\r\npropriety of a negative, either absolute or qualified, in the\r\nExecutive, upon the acts of the legislative branches. Without the\r\none or the other, the former would be absolutely unable to defend\r\nhimself against the depredations of the latter. He might gradually\r\nbe stripped of his authorities by successive resolutions, or\r\nannihilated by a single vote. And in the one mode or the other, the\r\nlegislative and executive powers might speedily come to be blended\r\nin the same hands. If even no propensity had ever discovered itself\r\nin the legislative body to invade the rights of the Executive, the\r\nrules of just reasoning and theoretic propriety would of themselves\r\nteach us, that the one ought not to be left to the mercy of the\r\nother, but ought to possess a constitutional and effectual power of\r\nselfdefense.\r\n\r\nBut the power in question has a further use. It not only serves\r\nas a shield to the Executive, but it furnishes an additional\r\nsecurity against the enaction of improper laws. It establishes a\r\nsalutary check upon the legislative body, calculated to guard the\r\ncommunity against the effects of faction, precipitancy, or of any\r\nimpulse unfriendly to the public good, which may happen to influence\r\na majority of that body.\r\n\r\nThe propriety of a negative has, upon some occasions, been\r\ncombated by an observation, that it was not to be presumed a single\r\nman would possess more virtue and wisdom than a number of men; and\r\nthat unless this presumption should be entertained, it would be\r\nimproper to give the executive magistrate any species of control\r\nover the legislative body.\r\n\r\nBut this observation, when examined, will appear rather specious\r\nthan solid. The propriety of the thing does not turn upon the\r\nsupposition of superior wisdom or virtue in the Executive, but upon\r\nthe supposition that the legislature will not be infallible; that\r\nthe love of power may sometimes betray it into a disposition to\r\nencroach upon the rights of other members of the government; that a\r\nspirit of faction may sometimes pervert its deliberations; that\r\nimpressions of the moment may sometimes hurry it into measures which\r\nitself, on maturer reflexion, would condemn. The primary inducement\r\nto conferring the power in question upon the Executive is, to enable\r\nhim to defend himself; the secondary one is to increase the chances\r\nin favor of the community against the passing of bad laws, through\r\nhaste, inadvertence, or design. The oftener the measure is brought\r\nunder examination, the greater the diversity in the situations of\r\nthose who are to examine it, the less must be the danger of those\r\nerrors which flow from want of due deliberation, or of those\r\nmissteps which proceed from the contagion of some common passion or\r\ninterest. It is far less probable, that culpable views of any kind\r\nshould infect all the parts of the government at the same moment and\r\nin relation to the same object, than that they should by turns\r\ngovern and mislead every one of them.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be said that the power of preventing bad laws\r\nincludes that of preventing good ones; and may be used to the one\r\npurpose as well as to the other. But this objection will have\r\nlittle weight with those who can properly estimate the mischiefs of\r\nthat inconstancy and mutability in the laws, which form the greatest\r\nblemish in the character and genius of our governments. They will\r\nconsider every institution calculated to restrain the excess of\r\nlaw-making, and to keep things in the same state in which they\r\nhappen to be at any given period, as much more likely to do good\r\nthan harm; because it is favorable to greater stability in the\r\nsystem of legislation. The injury which may possibly be done by\r\ndefeating a few good laws, will be amply compensated by the\r\nadvantage of preventing a number of bad ones.\r\n\r\nNor is this all. The superior weight and influence of the\r\nlegislative body in a free government, and the hazard to the\r\nExecutive in a trial of strength with that body, afford a\r\nsatisfactory security that the negative would generally be employed\r\nwith great caution; and there would oftener be room for a charge of\r\ntimidity than of rashness in the exercise of it. A king of Great\r\nBritain, with all his train of sovereign attributes, and with all\r\nthe influence he draws from a thousand sources, would, at this day,\r\nhesitate to put a negative upon the joint resolutions of the two\r\nhouses of Parliament. He would not fail to exert the utmost\r\nresources of that influence to strangle a measure disagreeable to\r\nhim, in its progress to the throne, to avoid being reduced to the\r\ndilemma of permitting it to take effect, or of risking the\r\ndispleasure of the nation by an opposition to the sense of the\r\nlegislative body. Nor is it probable, that he would ultimately\r\nventure to exert his prerogatives, but in a case of manifest\r\npropriety, or extreme necessity. All well-informed men in that\r\nkingdom will accede to the justness of this remark. A very\r\nconsiderable period has elapsed since the negative of the crown has\r\nbeen exercised.\r\n\r\nIf a magistrate so powerful and so well fortified as a British\r\nmonarch, would have scruples about the exercise of the power under\r\nconsideration, how much greater caution may be reasonably expected\r\nin a President of the United States, clothed for the short period of\r\nfour years with the executive authority of a government wholly and\r\npurely republican?\r\n\r\nIt is evident that there would be greater danger of his not\r\nusing his power when necessary, than of his using it too often, or\r\ntoo much. An argument, indeed, against its expediency, has been\r\ndrawn from this very source. It has been represented, on this\r\naccount, as a power odious in appearance, useless in practice. But\r\nit will not follow, that because it might be rarely exercised, it\r\nwould never be exercised. In the case for which it is chiefly\r\ndesigned, that of an immediate attack upon the constitutional rights\r\nof the Executive, or in a case in which the public good was\r\nevidently and palpably sacrificed, a man of tolerable firmness would\r\navail himself of his constitutional means of defense, and would\r\nlisten to the admonitions of duty and responsibility. In the former\r\nsupposition, his fortitude would be stimulated by his immediate\r\ninterest in the power of his office; in the latter, by the\r\nprobability of the sanction of his constituents, who, though they\r\nwould naturally incline to the legislative body in a doubtful case,\r\nwould hardly suffer their partiality to delude them in a very plain\r\ncase. I speak now with an eye to a magistrate possessing only a\r\ncommon share of firmness. There are men who, under any\r\ncircumstances, will have the courage to do their duty at every\r\nhazard.\r\n\r\nBut the convention have pursued a mean in this business, which\r\nwill both facilitate the exercise of the power vested in this\r\nrespect in the executive magistrate, and make its efficacy to depend\r\non the sense of a considerable part of the legislative body.\r\nInstead of an absolute negative, it is proposed to give the\r\nExecutive the qualified negative already described. This is a power\r\nwhich would be much more readily exercised than the other. A man\r\nwho might be afraid to defeat a law by his single VETO, might not\r\nscruple to return it for reconsideration; subject to being finally\r\nrejected only in the event of more than one third of each house\r\nconcurring in the sufficiency of his objections. He would be\r\nencouraged by the reflection, that if his opposition should prevail,\r\nit would embark in it a very respectable proportion of the\r\nlegislative body, whose influence would be united with his in\r\nsupporting the propriety of his conduct in the public opinion. A\r\ndirect and categorical negative has something in the appearance of\r\nit more harsh, and more apt to irritate, than the mere suggestion of\r\nargumentative objections to be approved or disapproved by those to\r\nwhom they are addressed. In proportion as it would be less apt to\r\noffend, it would be more apt to be exercised; and for this very\r\nreason, it may in practice be found more effectual. It is to be\r\nhoped that it will not often happen that improper views will govern\r\nso large a proportion as two thirds of both branches of the\r\nlegislature at the same time; and this, too, in spite of the\r\ncounterposing weight of the Executive. It is at any rate far less\r\nprobable that this should be the case, than that such views should\r\ntaint the resolutions and conduct of a bare majority. A power of\r\nthis nature in the Executive, will often have a silent and\r\nunperceived, though forcible, operation. When men, engaged in\r\nunjustifiable pursuits, are aware that obstructions may come from a\r\nquarter which they cannot control, they will often be restrained by\r\nthe bare apprehension of opposition, from doing what they would with\r\neagerness rush into, if no such external impediments were to be\r\nfeared.\r\n\r\nThis qualified negative, as has been elsewhere remarked, is in\r\nthis State vested in a council, consisting of the governor, with the\r\nchancellor and judges of the Supreme Court, or any two of them. It\r\nhas been freely employed upon a variety of occasions, and frequently\r\nwith success. And its utility has become so apparent, that persons\r\nwho, in compiling the Constitution, were violent opposers of it,\r\nhave from experience become its declared admirers.1\r\n\r\nI have in another place remarked, that the convention, in the\r\nformation of this part of their plan, had departed from the model of\r\nthe constitution of this State, in favor of that of Massachusetts.\r\nTwo strong reasons may be imagined for this preference. One is\r\nthat the judges, who are to be the interpreters of the law, might\r\nreceive an improper bias, from having given a previous opinion in\r\ntheir revisionary capacities; the other is that by being often\r\nassociated with the Executive, they might be induced to embark too\r\nfar in the political views of that magistrate, and thus a dangerous\r\ncombination might by degrees be cemented between the executive and\r\njudiciary departments. It is impossible to keep the judges too\r\ndistinct from every other avocation than that of expounding the laws.\r\nIt is peculiarly dangerous to place them in a situation to be\r\neither corrupted or influenced by the Executive.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n1 Mr. Abraham Yates, a warm opponent of the plan of the\r\nconvention is of this number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 74\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Command of the Military and Naval Forces, and the Pardoning\r\nPower of the Executive\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, March 25, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTHE President of the United States is to be \"commander-in-chief\r\nof the army and navy of the United States, and of the militia of the\r\nseveral States WHEN CALLED INTO THE ACTUAL SERVICE of the United\r\nStates.\" The propriety of this provision is so evident in itself,\r\nand it is, at the same time, so consonant to the precedents of the\r\nState constitutions in general, that little need be said to explain\r\nor enforce it. Even those of them which have, in other respects,\r\ncoupled the chief magistrate with a council, have for the most part\r\nconcentrated the military authority in him alone. Of all the cares\r\nor concerns of government, the direction of war most peculiarly\r\ndemands those qualities which distinguish the exercise of power by a\r\nsingle hand. The direction of war implies the direction of the\r\ncommon strength; and the power of directing and employing the\r\ncommon strength, forms a usual and essential part in the definition\r\nof the executive authority.\r\n\r\n\"The President may require the opinion, in writing, of the\r\nprincipal officer in each of the executive departments, upon any\r\nsubject relating to the duties of their respective officers.\" This\r\nI consider as a mere redundancy in the plan, as the right for which\r\nit provides would result of itself from the office.\r\n\r\nHe is also to be authorized to grant \"reprieves and pardons for\r\noffenses against the United States, EXCEPT IN CASES OF\r\nIMPEACHMENT.\" Humanity and good policy conspire to dictate, that\r\nthe benign prerogative of pardoning should be as little as possible\r\nfettered or embarrassed. The criminal code of every country\r\npartakes so much of necessary severity, that without an easy access\r\nto exceptions in favor of unfortunate guilt, justice would wear a\r\ncountenance too sanguinary and cruel. As the sense of\r\nresponsibility is always strongest, in proportion as it is\r\nundivided, it may be inferred that a single man would be most ready\r\nto attend to the force of those motives which might plead for a\r\nmitigation of the rigor of the law, and least apt to yield to\r\nconsiderations which were calculated to shelter a fit object of its\r\nvengeance. The reflection that the fate of a fellow-creature\r\ndepended on his sole fiat, would naturally inspire\r\nscrupulousness and caution; the dread of being accused of weakness\r\nor connivance, would beget equal circumspection, though of a\r\ndifferent kind. On the other hand, as men generally derive\r\nconfidence from their numbers, they might often encourage each other\r\nin an act of obduracy, and might be less sensible to the\r\napprehension of suspicion or censure for an injudicious or affected\r\nclemency. On these accounts, one man appears to be a more eligible\r\ndispenser of the mercy of government, than a body of men.\r\n\r\nThe expediency of vesting the power of pardoning in the\r\nPresident has, if I mistake not, been only contested in relation to\r\nthe crime of treason. This, it has been urged, ought to have\r\ndepended upon the assent of one, or both, of the branches of the\r\nlegislative body. I shall not deny that there are strong reasons to\r\nbe assigned for requiring in this particular the concurrence of that\r\nbody, or of a part of it. As treason is a crime levelled at the\r\nimmediate being of the society, when the laws have once ascertained\r\nthe guilt of the offender, there seems a fitness in referring the\r\nexpediency of an act of mercy towards him to the judgment of the\r\nlegislature. And this ought the rather to be the case, as the\r\nsupposition of the connivance of the Chief Magistrate ought not to\r\nbe entirely excluded. But there are also strong objections to such\r\na plan. It is not to be doubted, that a single man of prudence and\r\ngood sense is better fitted, in delicate conjunctures, to balance\r\nthe motives which may plead for and against the remission of the\r\npunishment, than any numerous body whatever. It deserves particular\r\nattention, that treason will often be connected with seditions which\r\nembrace a large proportion of the community; as lately happened in\r\nMassachusetts. In every such case, we might expect to see the\r\nrepresentation of the people tainted with the same spirit which had\r\ngiven birth to the offense. And when parties were pretty equally\r\nmatched, the secret sympathy of the friends and favorers of the\r\ncondemned person, availing itself of the good-nature and weakness of\r\nothers, might frequently bestow impunity where the terror of an\r\nexample was necessary. On the other hand, when the sedition had\r\nproceeded from causes which had inflamed the resentments of the\r\nmajor party, they might often be found obstinate and inexorable,\r\nwhen policy demanded a conduct of forbearance and clemency. But the\r\nprincipal argument for reposing the power of pardoning in this case\r\nto the Chief Magistrate is this: in seasons of insurrection or\r\nrebellion, there are often critical moments, when a welltimed offer\r\nof pardon to the insurgents or rebels may restore the tranquillity\r\nof the commonwealth; and which, if suffered to pass unimproved, it\r\nmay never be possible afterwards to recall. The dilatory process of\r\nconvening the legislature, or one of its branches, for the purpose\r\nof obtaining its sanction to the measure, would frequently be the\r\noccasion of letting slip the golden opportunity. The loss of a\r\nweek, a day, an hour, may sometimes be fatal. If it should be\r\nobserved, that a discretionary power, with a view to such\r\ncontingencies, might be occasionally conferred upon the President,\r\nit may be answered in the first place, that it is questionable,\r\nwhether, in a limited Constitution, that power could be delegated by\r\nlaw; and in the second place, that it would generally be impolitic\r\nbeforehand to take any step which might hold out the prospect of\r\nimpunity. A proceeding of this kind, out of the usual course, would\r\nbe likely to be construed into an argument of timidity or of\r\nweakness, and would have a tendency to embolden guilt.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 75\r\n\r\nThe Treaty-Making Power of the Executive\r\n\r\nFor the Independent Journal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTHE President is to have power, \"by and with the advice and\r\nconsent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the\r\nsenators present concur.\"\r\n\r\nThough this provision has been assailed, on different grounds,\r\nwith no small degree of vehemence, I scruple not to declare my firm\r\npersuasion, that it is one of the best digested and most\r\nunexceptionable parts of the plan. One ground of objection is the\r\ntrite topic of the intermixture of powers; some contending that the\r\nPresident ought alone to possess the power of making treaties;\r\nothers, that it ought to have been exclusively deposited in the\r\nSenate. Another source of objection is derived from the small\r\nnumber of persons by whom a treaty may be made. Of those who\r\nespouse this objection, a part are of opinion that the House of\r\nRepresentatives ought to have been associated in the business, while\r\nanother part seem to think that nothing more was necessary than to\r\nhave substituted two thirds of ALL the members of the Senate, to two\r\nthirds of the members PRESENT. As I flatter myself the observations\r\nmade in a preceding number upon this part of the plan must have\r\nsufficed to place it, to a discerning eye, in a very favorable\r\nlight, I shall here content myself with offering only some\r\nsupplementary remarks, principally with a view to the objections\r\nwhich have been just stated.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the intermixture of powers, I shall rely upon the\r\nexplanations already given in other places, of the true sense of the\r\nrule upon which that objection is founded; and shall take it for\r\ngranted, as an inference from them, that the union of the Executive\r\nwith the Senate, in the article of treaties, is no infringement of\r\nthat rule. I venture to add, that the particular nature of the\r\npower of making treaties indicates a peculiar propriety in that\r\nunion. Though several writers on the subject of government place\r\nthat power in the class of executive authorities, yet this is\r\nevidently an arbitrary disposition; for if we attend carefully to\r\nits operation, it will be found to partake more of the legislative\r\nthan of the executive character, though it does not seem strictly to\r\nfall within the definition of either of them. The essence of the\r\nlegislative authority is to enact laws, or, in other words, to\r\nprescribe rules for the regulation of the society; while the\r\nexecution of the laws, and the employment of the common strength,\r\neither for this purpose or for the common defense, seem to comprise\r\nall the functions of the executive magistrate. The power of making\r\ntreaties is, plainly, neither the one nor the other. It relates\r\nneither to the execution of the subsisting laws, nor to the enaction\r\nof new ones; and still less to an exertion of the common strength.\r\nIts objects are CONTRACTS with foreign nations, which have the\r\nforce of law, but derive it from the obligations of good faith.\r\nThey are not rules prescribed by the sovereign to the subject, but\r\nagreements between sovereign and sovereign. The power in question\r\nseems therefore to form a distinct department, and to belong,\r\nproperly, neither to the legislative nor to the executive. The\r\nqualities elsewhere detailed as indispensable in the management of\r\nforeign negotiations, point out the Executive as the most fit agent\r\nin those transactions; while the vast importance of the trust, and\r\nthe operation of treaties as laws, plead strongly for the\r\nparticipation of the whole or a portion of the legislative body in\r\nthe office of making them.\r\n\r\nHowever proper or safe it may be in governments where the\r\nexecutive magistrate is an hereditary monarch, to commit to him the\r\nentire power of making treaties, it would be utterly unsafe and\r\nimproper to intrust that power to an elective magistrate of four\r\nyears' duration. It has been remarked, upon another occasion, and\r\nthe remark is unquestionably just, that an hereditary monarch,\r\nthough often the oppressor of his people, has personally too much\r\nstake in the government to be in any material danger of being\r\ncorrupted by foreign powers. But a man raised from the station of a\r\nprivate citizen to the rank of chief magistrate, possessed of a\r\nmoderate or slender fortune, and looking forward to a period not\r\nvery remote when he may probably be obliged to return to the station\r\nfrom which he was taken, might sometimes be under temptations to\r\nsacrifice his duty to his interest, which it would require\r\nsuperlative virtue to withstand. An avaricious man might be tempted\r\nto betray the interests of the state to the acquisition of wealth.\r\nAn ambitious man might make his own aggrandizement, by the aid of a\r\nforeign power, the price of his treachery to his constituents. The\r\nhistory of human conduct does not warrant that exalted opinion of\r\nhuman virtue which would make it wise in a nation to commit\r\ninterests of so delicate and momentous a kind, as those which\r\nconcern its intercourse with the rest of the world, to the sole\r\ndisposal of a magistrate created and circumstanced as would be a\r\nPresident of the United States.\r\n\r\nTo have intrusted the power of making treaties to the Senate\r\nalone, would have been to relinquish the benefits of the\r\nconstitutional agency of the President in the conduct of foreign\r\nnegotiations. It is true that the Senate would, in that case, have\r\nthe option of employing him in this capacity, but they would also\r\nhave the option of letting it alone, and pique or cabal might induce\r\nthe latter rather than the former. Besides this, the ministerial\r\nservant of the Senate could not be expected to enjoy the confidence\r\nand respect of foreign powers in the same degree with the\r\nconstitutional representatives of the nation, and, of course, would\r\nnot be able to act with an equal degree of weight or efficacy.\r\nWhile the Union would, from this cause, lose a considerable\r\nadvantage in the management of its external concerns, the people\r\nwould lose the additional security which would result from the\r\nco-operation of the Executive. Though it would be imprudent to\r\nconfide in him solely so important a trust, yet it cannot be doubted\r\nthat his participation would materially add to the safety of the\r\nsociety. It must indeed be clear to a demonstration that the joint\r\npossession of the power in question, by the President and Senate,\r\nwould afford a greater prospect of security, than the separate\r\npossession of it by either of them. And whoever has maturely\r\nweighed the circumstances which must concur in the appointment of a\r\nPresident, will be satisfied that the office will always bid fair to\r\nbe filled by men of such characters as to render their concurrence\r\nin the formation of treaties peculiarly desirable, as well on the\r\nscore of wisdom, as on that of integrity.\r\n\r\nThe remarks made in a former number, which have been alluded to\r\nin another part of this paper, will apply with conclusive force\r\nagainst the admission of the House of Representatives to a share in\r\nthe formation of treaties. The fluctuating and, taking its future\r\nincrease into the account, the multitudinous composition of that\r\nbody, forbid us to expect in it those qualities which are essential\r\nto the proper execution of such a trust. Accurate and comprehensive\r\nknowledge of foreign politics; a steady and systematic adherence to\r\nthe same views; a nice and uniform sensibility to national\r\ncharacter; decision, SECRECY, and despatch, are incompatible with\r\nthe genius of a body so variable and so numerous. The very\r\ncomplication of the business, by introducing a necessity of the\r\nconcurrence of so many different bodies, would of itself afford a\r\nsolid objection. The greater frequency of the calls upon the House\r\nof Representatives, and the greater length of time which it would\r\noften be necessary to keep them together when convened, to obtain\r\ntheir sanction in the progressive stages of a treaty, would be a\r\nsource of so great inconvenience and expense as alone ought to\r\ncondemn the project.\r\n\r\nThe only objection which remains to be canvassed, is that which\r\nwould substitute the proportion of two thirds of all the members\r\ncomposing the senatorial body, to that of two thirds of the members\r\nPRESENT. It has been shown, under the second head of our inquiries,\r\nthat all provisions which require more than the majority of any body\r\nto its resolutions, have a direct tendency to embarrass the\r\noperations of the government, and an indirect one to subject the\r\nsense of the majority to that of the minority. This consideration\r\nseems sufficient to determine our opinion, that the convention have\r\ngone as far in the endeavor to secure the advantage of numbers in\r\nthe formation of treaties as could have been reconciled either with\r\nthe activity of the public councils or with a reasonable regard to\r\nthe major sense of the community. If two thirds of the whole number\r\nof members had been required, it would, in many cases, from the\r\nnon-attendance of a part, amount in practice to a necessity of\r\nunanimity. And the history of every political establishment in\r\nwhich this principle has prevailed, is a history of impotence,\r\nperplexity, and disorder. Proofs of this position might be adduced\r\nfrom the examples of the Roman Tribuneship, the Polish Diet, and the\r\nStates-General of the Netherlands, did not an example at home render\r\nforeign precedents unnecessary.\r\n\r\nTo require a fixed proportion of the whole body would not, in\r\nall probability, contribute to the advantages of a numerous agency,\r\nbetter then merely to require a proportion of the attending members.\r\nThe former, by making a determinate number at all times requisite\r\nto a resolution, diminishes the motives to punctual attendance. The\r\nlatter, by making the capacity of the body to depend on a PROPORTION\r\nwhich may be varied by the absence or presence of a single member,\r\nhas the contrary effect. And as, by promoting punctuality, it tends\r\nto keep the body complete, there is great likelihood that its\r\nresolutions would generally be dictated by as great a number in this\r\ncase as in the other; while there would be much fewer occasions of\r\ndelay. It ought not to be forgotten that, under the existing\r\nConfederation, two members MAY, and usually DO, represent a State;\r\nwhence it happens that Congress, who now are solely invested with\r\nALL THE POWERS of the Union, rarely consist of a greater number of\r\npersons than would compose the intended Senate. If we add to this,\r\nthat as the members vote by States, and that where there is only a\r\nsingle member present from a State, his vote is lost, it will\r\njustify a supposition that the active voices in the Senate, where\r\nthe members are to vote individually, would rarely fall short in\r\nnumber of the active voices in the existing Congress. When, in\r\naddition to these considerations, we take into view the co-operation\r\nof the President, we shall not hesitate to infer that the people of\r\nAmerica would have greater security against an improper use of the\r\npower of making treaties, under the new Constitution, than they now\r\nenjoy under the Confederation. And when we proceed still one step\r\nfurther, and look forward to the probable augmentation of the\r\nSenate, by the erection of new States, we shall not only perceive\r\nample ground of confidence in the sufficiency of the members to\r\nwhose agency that power will be intrusted, but we shall probably be\r\nled to conclude that a body more numerous than the Senate would be\r\nlikely to become, would be very little fit for the proper discharge\r\nof the trust.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 76\r\n\r\nThe Appointing Power of the Executive\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nTuesday, April 1, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTHE President is \"to NOMINATE, and, by and with the advice and\r\nconsent of the Senate, to appoint ambassadors, other public\r\nministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court, and all other\r\nofficers of the United States whose appointments are not otherwise\r\nprovided for in the Constitution. But the Congress may by law vest\r\nthe appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper, in\r\nthe President alone, or in the courts of law, or in the heads of\r\ndepartments. The President shall have power to fill up ALL\r\nVACANCIES which may happen DURING THE RECESS OF THE SENATE, by\r\ngranting commissions which shall EXPIRE at the end of their next\r\nsession.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been observed in a former paper, that \"the true test of\r\na good government is its aptitude and tendency to produce a good\r\nadministration.\" If the justness of this observation be admitted,\r\nthe mode of appointing the officers of the United States contained\r\nin the foregoing clauses, must, when examined, be allowed to be\r\nentitled to particular commendation. It is not easy to conceive a\r\nplan better calculated than this to promote a judicious choice of\r\nmen for filling the offices of the Union; and it will not need\r\nproof, that on this point must essentially depend the character of\r\nits administration.\r\n\r\nIt will be agreed on all hands, that the power of appointment,\r\nin ordinary cases, ought to be modified in one of three ways. It\r\nought either to be vested in a single man, or in a SELECT assembly\r\nof a moderate number; or in a single man, with the concurrence of\r\nsuch an assembly. The exercise of it by the people at large will be\r\nreadily admitted to be impracticable; as waiving every other\r\nconsideration, it would leave them little time to do anything else.\r\nWhen, therefore, mention is made in the subsequent reasonings of an\r\nassembly or body of men, what is said must be understood to relate\r\nto a select body or assembly, of the description already given. The\r\npeople collectively, from their number and from their dispersed\r\nsituation, cannot be regulated in their movements by that systematic\r\nspirit of cabal and intrigue, which will be urged as the chief\r\nobjections to reposing the power in question in a body of men.\r\n\r\nThose who have themselves reflected upon the subject, or who\r\nhave attended to the observations made in other parts of these\r\npapers, in relation to the appointment of the President, will, I\r\npresume, agree to the position, that there would always be great\r\nprobability of having the place supplied by a man of abilities, at\r\nleast respectable. Premising this, I proceed to lay it down as a\r\nrule, that one man of discernment is better fitted to analyze and\r\nestimate the peculiar qualities adapted to particular offices, than\r\na body of men of equal or perhaps even of superior discernment.\r\n\r\nThe sole and undivided responsibility of one man will naturally\r\nbeget a livelier sense of duty and a more exact regard to reputation.\r\nHe will, on this account, feel himself under stronger obligations,\r\nand more interested to investigate with care the qualities requisite\r\nto the stations to be filled, and to prefer with impartiality the\r\npersons who may have the fairest pretensions to them. He will have\r\nFEWER personal attachments to gratify, than a body of men who may\r\neach be supposed to have an equal number; and will be so much the\r\nless liable to be misled by the sentiments of friendship and of\r\naffection. A single well-directed man, by a single understanding,\r\ncannot be distracted and warped by that diversity of views,\r\nfeelings, and interests, which frequently distract and warp the\r\nresolutions of a collective body. There is nothing so apt to\r\nagitate the passions of mankind as personal considerations whether\r\nthey relate to ourselves or to others, who are to be the objects of\r\nour choice or preference. Hence, in every exercise of the power of\r\nappointing to offices, by an assembly of men, we must expect to see\r\na full display of all the private and party likings and dislikes,\r\npartialities and antipathies, attachments and animosities, which are\r\nfelt by those who compose the assembly. The choice which may at any\r\ntime happen to be made under such circumstances, will of course be\r\nthe result either of a victory gained by one party over the other,\r\nor of a compromise between the parties. In either case, the\r\nintrinsic merit of the candidate will be too often out of sight. In\r\nthe first, the qualifications best adapted to uniting the suffrages\r\nof the party, will be more considered than those which fit the\r\nperson for the station. In the last, the coalition will commonly\r\nturn upon some interested equivalent: \"Give us the man we wish for\r\nthis office, and you shall have the one you wish for that.\" This\r\nwill be the usual condition of the bargain. And it will rarely\r\nhappen that the advancement of the public service will be the\r\nprimary object either of party victories or of party negotiations.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the principles here advanced seems to have been\r\nfelt by the most intelligent of those who have found fault with the\r\nprovision made, in this respect, by the convention. They contend\r\nthat the President ought solely to have been authorized to make the\r\nappointments under the federal government. But it is easy to show,\r\nthat every advantage to be expected from such an arrangement would,\r\nin substance, be derived from the power of NOMINATION, which is\r\nproposed to be conferred upon him; while several disadvantages\r\nwhich might attend the absolute power of appointment in the hands of\r\nthat officer would be avoided. In the act of nomination, his\r\njudgment alone would be exercised; and as it would be his sole duty\r\nto point out the man who, with the approbation of the Senate, should\r\nfill an office, his responsibility would be as complete as if he\r\nwere to make the final appointment. There can, in this view, be no\r\ndifference others, who are to be the objects of our choice or\r\npreference. Hence, in every exercise of the power of appointing to\r\noffices, by an assembly of men, we must expect to see a full display\r\nof all the private and party likings and dislikes, partialities and\r\nantipathies, attachments and animosities, which are felt by those\r\nwho compose the assembly. The choice which may at any time happen\r\nto be made under such circumstances, will of course be the result\r\neither of a victory gained by one party over the other, or of a\r\ncompromise between the parties. In either case, the intrinsic merit\r\nof the candidate will be too often out of sight. In the first, the\r\nqualifications best adapted to uniting the suffrages of the party,\r\nwill be more considered than those which fit the person for the\r\nstation. In the last, the coalition will commonly turn upon some\r\ninterested equivalent: \"Give us the man we wish for this office,\r\nand you shall have the one you wish for that.\" This will be the\r\nusual condition of the bargain. And it will rarely happen that the\r\nadvancement of the public service will be the primary object either\r\nof party victories or of party negotiations.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the principles here advanced seems to have been\r\nfelt by the most intelligent of those who have found fault with the\r\nprovision made, in this respect, by the convention. They contend\r\nthat the President ought solely to have been authorized to make the\r\nappointments under the federal government. But it is easy to show,\r\nthat every advantage to be expected from such an arrangement would,\r\nin substance, be derived from the power of NOMINATION, which is\r\nproposed to be conferred upon him; while several disadvantages\r\nwhich might attend the absolute power of appointment in the hands of\r\nthat officer would be avoided.

There can, in this view, be no\r\ndifference between nominating and appointing. The same motives\r\nwhich would influence a proper discharge of his duty in one case,\r\nwould exist in the other. And as no man could be appointed but on\r\nhis previous nomination, every man who might be appointed would be,\r\nin fact, his choice.\r\n\r\nBut might not his nomination be overruled? I grant it might,\r\nyet this could only be to make place for another nomination by\r\nhimself. The person ultimately appointed must be the object of his\r\npreference, though perhaps not in the first degree. It is also not\r\nvery probable that his nomination would often be overruled. The\r\nSenate could not be tempted, by the preference they might feel to\r\nanother, to reject the one proposed; because they could not assure\r\nthemselves, that the person they might wish would be brought forward\r\nby a second or by any subsequent nomination. They could not even be\r\ncertain, that a future nomination would present a candidate in any\r\ndegree more acceptable to them; and as their dissent might cast a\r\nkind of stigma upon the individual rejected, and might have the\r\nappearance of a reflection upon the judgment of the chief\r\nmagistrate, it is not likely that their sanction would often be\r\nrefused, where there were not special and strong reasons for the\r\nrefusal.\r\n\r\nTo what purpose then require the co-operation of the Senate? I\r\nanswer, that the necessity of their concurrence would have a\r\npowerful, though, in general, a silent operation. It would be an\r\nexcellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the President, and\r\nwould tend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters\r\nfrom State prejudice, from family connection, from personal\r\nattachment, or from a view to popularity. In addition to this, it\r\nwould be an efficacious source of stability in the administration.\r\n\r\nIt will readily be comprehended, that a man who had himself the\r\nsole disposition of offices, would be governed much more by his\r\nprivate inclinations and interests, than when he was bound to submit\r\nthe propriety of his choice to the discussion and determination of a\r\ndifferent and independent body, and that body an entire branch of\r\nthe legislature. The possibility of rejection would be a strong\r\nmotive to care in proposing. The danger to his own reputation, and,\r\nin the case of an elective magistrate, to his political existence,\r\nfrom betraying a spirit of favoritism, or an unbecoming pursuit of\r\npopularity, to the observation of a body whose opinion would have\r\ngreat weight in forming that of the public, could not fail to\r\noperate as a barrier to the one and to the other. He would be both\r\nashamed and afraid to bring forward, for the most distinguished or\r\nlucrative stations, candidates who had no other merit than that of\r\ncoming from the same State to which he particularly belonged, or of\r\nbeing in some way or other personally allied to him, or of\r\npossessing the necessary insignificance and pliancy to render them\r\nthe obsequious instruments of his pleasure.\r\n\r\nTo this reasoning it has been objected that the President, by\r\nthe influence of the power of nomination, may secure the\r\ncomplaisance of the Senate to his views. This supposition of\r\nuniversal venalty in human nature is little less an error in\r\npolitical reasoning, than the supposition of universal rectitude.\r\nThe institution of delegated power implies, that there is a portion\r\nof virtue and honor among mankind, which may be a reasonable\r\nfoundation of confidence; and experience justifies the theory. It\r\nhas been found to exist in the most corrupt periods of the most\r\ncorrupt governments. The venalty of the British House of Commons\r\nhas been long a topic of accusation against that body, in the\r\ncountry to which they belong as well as in this; and it cannot be\r\ndoubted that the charge is, to a considerable extent, well founded.\r\nBut it is as little to be doubted, that there is always a large\r\nproportion of the body, which consists of independent and\r\npublic-spirited men, who have an influential weight in the councils\r\nof the nation. Hence it is (the present reign not excepted) that\r\nthe sense of that body is often seen to control the inclinations of\r\nthe monarch, both with regard to men and to measures. Though it\r\nmight therefore be allowable to suppose that the Executive might\r\noccasionally influence some individuals in the Senate, yet the\r\nsupposition, that he could in general purchase the integrity of the\r\nwhole body, would be forced and improbable. A man disposed to view\r\nhuman nature as it is, without either flattering its virtues or\r\nexaggerating its vices, will see sufficient ground of confidence in\r\nthe probity of the Senate, to rest satisfied, not only that it will\r\nbe impracticable to the Executive to corrupt or seduce a majority of\r\nits members, but that the necessity of its co-operation, in the\r\nbusiness of appointments, will be a considerable and salutary\r\nrestraint upon the conduct of that magistrate. Nor is the integrity\r\nof the Senate the only reliance. The Constitution has provided some\r\nimportant guards against the danger of executive influence upon the\r\nlegislative body: it declares that \"No senator or representative\r\nshall during the time FOR WHICH HE WAS ELECTED, be appointed to any\r\ncivil office under the United States, which shall have been created,\r\nor the emoluments whereof shall have been increased, during such\r\ntime; and no person, holding any office under the United States,\r\nshall be a member of either house during his continuance in\r\noffice.\"\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 77\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Appointing Power Continued and Other Powers of the Executive\r\nConsidered\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Packet.\r\n\r\nFriday, April 4, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nIT HAS been mentioned as one of the advantages to be expected\r\nfrom the co-operation of the Senate, in the business of\r\nappointments, that it would contribute to the stability of the\r\nadministration. The consent of that body would be necessary to\r\ndisplace as well as to appoint. A change of the Chief Magistrate,\r\ntherefore, would not occasion so violent or so general a revolution\r\nin the officers of the government as might be expected, if he were\r\nthe sole disposer of offices. Where a man in any station had given\r\nsatisfactory evidence of his fitness for it, a new President would\r\nbe restrained from attempting a change in favor of a person more\r\nagreeable to him, by the apprehension that a discountenance of the\r\nSenate might frustrate the attempt, and bring some degree of\r\ndiscredit upon himself. Those who can best estimate the value of a\r\nsteady administration, will be most disposed to prize a provision\r\nwhich connects the official existence of public men with the\r\napprobation or disapprobation of that body which, from the greater\r\npermanency of its own composition, will in all probability be less\r\nsubject to inconstancy than any other member of the government.\r\n\r\nTo this union of the Senate with the President, in the article\r\nof appointments, it has in some cases been suggested that it would\r\nserve to give the President an undue influence over the Senate, and\r\nin others that it would have an opposite tendency, a strong proof\r\nthat neither suggestion is true.\r\n\r\nTo state the first in its proper form, is to refute it. It\r\namounts to this: the President would have an improper INFLUENCE\r\nOVER the Senate, because the Senate would have the power of\r\nRESTRAINING him. This is an absurdity in terms. It cannot admit of\r\na doubt that the entire power of appointment would enable him much\r\nmore effectually to establish a dangerous empire over that body,\r\nthan a mere power of nomination subject to their control.\r\n\r\nLet us take a view of the converse of the proposition: \"the\r\nSenate would influence the Executive.\" As I have had occasion to\r\nremark in several other instances, the indistinctness of the\r\nobjection forbids a precise answer. In what manner is this\r\ninfluence to be exerted? In relation to what objects? The power of\r\ninfluencing a person, in the sense in which it is here used, must\r\nimply a power of conferring a benefit upon him. How could the\r\nSenate confer a benefit upon the President by the manner of\r\nemploying their right of negative upon his nominations? If it be\r\nsaid they might sometimes gratify him by an acquiescence in a\r\nfavorite choice, when public motives might dictate a different\r\nconduct, I answer, that the instances in which the President could\r\nbe personally interested in the result, would be too few to admit of\r\nhis being materially affected by the compliances of the Senate. The\r\nPOWER which can ORIGINATE the disposition of honors and emoluments,\r\nis more likely to attract than to be attracted by the POWER which\r\ncan merely obstruct their course. If by influencing the President\r\nbe meant RESTRAINING him, this is precisely what must have been\r\nintended. And it has been shown that the restraint would be\r\nsalutary, at the same time that it would not be such as to destroy a\r\nsingle advantage to be looked for from the uncontrolled agency of\r\nthat Magistrate. The right of nomination would produce all the good\r\nof that of appointment, and would in a great measure avoid its evils.\r\nUpon a comparison of the plan for the appointment of the\r\nofficers of the proposed government with that which is established\r\nby the constitution of this State, a decided preference must be\r\ngiven to the former. In that plan the power of nomination is\r\nunequivocally vested in the Executive. And as there would be a\r\nnecessity for submitting each nomination to the judgment of an\r\nentire branch of the legislature, the circumstances attending an\r\nappointment, from the mode of conducting it, would naturally become\r\nmatters of notoriety; and the public would be at no loss to\r\ndetermine what part had been performed by the different actors. The\r\nblame of a bad nomination would fall upon the President singly and\r\nabsolutely. The censure of rejecting a good one would lie entirely\r\nat the door of the Senate; aggravated by the consideration of their\r\nhaving counteracted the good intentions of the Executive. If an ill\r\nappointment should be made, the Executive for nominating, and the\r\nSenate for approving, would participate, though in different\r\ndegrees, in the opprobrium and disgrace.\r\n\r\nThe reverse of all this characterizes the manner of appointment\r\nin this State. The council of appointment consists of from three to\r\nfive persons, of whom the governor is always one. This small body,\r\nshut up in a private apartment, impenetrable to the public eye,\r\nproceed to the execution of the trust committed to them. It is\r\nknown that the governor claims the right of nomination, upon the\r\nstrength of some ambiguous expressions in the constitution; but it\r\nis not known to what extent, or in what manner he exercises it; nor\r\nupon what occasions he is contradicted or opposed. The censure of a\r\nbad appointment, on account of the uncertainty of its author, and\r\nfor want of a determinate object, has neither poignancy nor duration.\r\nAnd while an unbounded field for cabal and intrigue lies open, all\r\nidea of responsibility is lost. The most that the public can know,\r\nis that the governor claims the right of nomination; that TWO out\r\nof the inconsiderable number of FOUR men can too often be managed\r\nwithout much difficulty; that if some of the members of a\r\nparticular council should happen to be of an uncomplying character,\r\nit is frequently not impossible to get rid of their opposition by\r\nregulating the times of meeting in such a manner as to render their\r\nattendance inconvenient; and that from whatever cause it may\r\nproceed, a great number of very improper appointments are from time\r\nto time made. Whether a governor of this State avails himself of\r\nthe ascendant he must necessarily have, in this delicate and\r\nimportant part of the administration, to prefer to offices men who\r\nare best qualified for them, or whether he prostitutes that\r\nadvantage to the advancement of persons whose chief merit is their\r\nimplicit devotion to his will, and to the support of a despicable\r\nand dangerous system of personal influence, are questions which,\r\nunfortunately for the community, can only be the subjects of\r\nspeculation and conjecture.\r\n\r\nEvery mere council of appointment, however constituted, will be\r\na conclave, in which cabal and intrigue will have their full scope.\r\nTheir number, without an unwarrantable increase of expense, cannot\r\nbe large enough to preclude a facility of combination. And as each\r\nmember will have his friends and connections to provide for, the\r\ndesire of mutual gratification will beget a scandalous bartering of\r\nvotes and bargaining for places. The private attachments of one man\r\nmight easily be satisfied; but to satisfy the private attachments\r\nof a dozen, or of twenty men, would occasion a monopoly of all the\r\nprincipal employments of the government in a few families, and would\r\nlead more directly to an aristocracy or an oligarchy than any\r\nmeasure that could be contrived. If, to avoid an accumulation of\r\noffices, there was to be a frequent change in the persons who were\r\nto compose the council, this would involve the mischiefs of a\r\nmutable administration in their full extent. Such a council would\r\nalso be more liable to executive influence than the Senate, because\r\nthey would be fewer in number, and would act less immediately under\r\nthe public inspection. Such a council, in fine, as a substitute for\r\nthe plan of the convention, would be productive of an increase of\r\nexpense, a multiplication of the evils which spring from favoritism\r\nand intrigue in the distribution of public honors, a decrease of\r\nstability in the administration of the government, and a diminution\r\nof the security against an undue influence of the Executive. And\r\nyet such a council has been warmly contended for as an essential\r\namendment in the proposed Constitution.\r\n\r\nI could not with propriety conclude my observations on the\r\nsubject of appointments without taking notice of a scheme for which\r\nthere have appeared some, though but few advocates; I mean that of\r\nuniting the House of Representatives in the power of making them. I\r\nshall, however, do little more than mention it, as I cannot imagine\r\nthat it is likely to gain the countenance of any considerable part\r\nof the community. A body so fluctuating and at the same time so\r\nnumerous, can never be deemed proper for the exercise of that power.\r\nIts unfitness will appear manifest to all, when it is recollected\r\nthat in half a century it may consist of three or four hundred\r\npersons. All the advantages of the stability, both of the Executive\r\nand of the Senate, would be defeated by this union, and infinite\r\ndelays and embarrassments would be occasioned. The example of most\r\nof the States in their local constitutions encourages us to\r\nreprobate the idea.\r\n\r\nThe only remaining powers of the Executive are comprehended in\r\ngiving information to Congress of the state of the Union; in\r\nrecommending to their consideration such measures as he shall judge\r\nexpedient; in convening them, or either branch, upon extraordinary\r\noccasions; in adjourning them when they cannot themselves agree\r\nupon the time of adjournment; in receiving ambassadors and other\r\npublic ministers; in faithfully executing the laws; and in\r\ncommissioning all the officers of the United States.\r\n\r\nExcept some cavils about the power of convening EITHER house of\r\nthe legislature, and that of receiving ambassadors, no objection has\r\nbeen made to this class of authorities; nor could they possibly\r\nadmit of any. It required, indeed, an insatiable avidity for\r\ncensure to invent exceptions to the parts which have been excepted\r\nto. In regard to the power of convening either house of the\r\nlegislature, I shall barely remark, that in respect to the Senate at\r\nleast, we can readily discover a good reason for it. AS this body\r\nhas a concurrent power with the Executive in the article of\r\ntreaties, it might often be necessary to call it together with a\r\nview to this object, when it would be unnecessary and improper to\r\nconvene the House of Representatives. As to the reception of\r\nambassadors, what I have said in a former paper will furnish a\r\nsufficient answer.\r\n\r\nWe have now completed a survey of the structure and powers of\r\nthe executive department, which, I have endeavored to show,\r\ncombines, as far as republican principles will admit, all the\r\nrequisites to energy. The remaining inquiry is: Does it also\r\ncombine the requisites to safety, in a republican sense, a due\r\ndependence on the people, a due responsibility? The answer to this\r\nquestion has been anticipated in the investigation of its other\r\ncharacteristics, and is satisfactorily deducible from these\r\ncircumstances; from the election of the President once in four\r\nyears by persons immediately chosen by the people for that purpose;\r\nand from his being at all times liable to impeachment, trial,\r\ndismission from office, incapacity to serve in any other, and to\r\nforfeiture of life and estate by subsequent prosecution in the\r\ncommon course of law. But these precautions, great as they are, are\r\nnot the only ones which the plan of the convention has provided in\r\nfavor of the public security. In the only instances in which the\r\nabuse of the executive authority was materially to be feared, the\r\nChief Magistrate of the United States would, by that plan, be\r\nsubjected to the control of a branch of the legislative body. What\r\nmore could be desired by an enlightened and reasonable people?\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 78\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Judiciary Department\r\n\r\nFrom McLEAN'S Edition, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nWE PROCEED now to an examination of the judiciary department of\r\nthe proposed government.\r\n\r\nIn unfolding the defects of the existing Confederation, the\r\nutility and necessity of a federal judicature have been clearly\r\npointed out. It is the less necessary to recapitulate the\r\nconsiderations there urged, as the propriety of the institution in\r\nthe abstract is not disputed; the only questions which have been\r\nraised being relative to the manner of constituting it, and to its\r\nextent. To these points, therefore, our observations shall be\r\nconfined.\r\n\r\nThe manner of constituting it seems to embrace these several\r\nobjects: 1st. The mode of appointing the judges. 2d. The tenure by\r\nwhich they are to hold their places. 3d. The partition of the\r\njudiciary authority between different courts, and their relations to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nFirst. As to the mode of appointing the judges; this is\r\nthe same with that of appointing the officers of the Union in\r\ngeneral, and has been so fully discussed in the two last numbers,\r\nthat nothing can be said here which would not be useless repetition.\r\n\r\nSecond. As to the tenure by which the judges are to hold\r\ntheir places; this chiefly concerns their duration in office; the\r\nprovisions for their support; the precautions for their\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nAccording to the plan of the convention, all judges who may be\r\nappointed by the United States are to hold their offices DURING GOOD\r\nBEHAVIOR; which is conformable to the most approved of the State\r\nconstitutions and among the rest, to that of this State. Its\r\npropriety having been drawn into question by the adversaries of that\r\nplan, is no light symptom of the rage for objection, which disorders\r\ntheir imaginations and judgments. The standard of good behavior for\r\nthe continuance in office of the judicial magistracy, is certainly\r\none of the most valuable of the modern improvements in the practice\r\nof government. In a monarchy it is an excellent barrier to the\r\ndespotism of the prince; in a republic it is a no less excellent\r\nbarrier to the encroachments and oppressions of the representative\r\nbody. And it is the best expedient which can be devised in any\r\ngovernment, to secure a steady, upright, and impartial\r\nadministration of the laws.\r\n\r\nWhoever attentively considers the different departments of power\r\nmust perceive, that, in a government in which they are separated\r\nfrom each other, the judiciary, from the nature of its functions,\r\nwill always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the\r\nConstitution; because it will be least in a capacity to annoy or\r\ninjure them. The Executive not only dispenses the honors, but holds\r\nthe sword of the community. The legislature not only commands the\r\npurse, but prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of\r\nevery citizen are to be regulated. The judiciary, on the contrary,\r\nhas no influence over either the sword or the purse; no direction\r\neither of the strength or of the wealth of the society; and can\r\ntake no active resolution whatever. It may truly be said to have\r\nneither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment; and must ultimately\r\ndepend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of\r\nits judgments.\r\n\r\nThis simple view of the matter suggests several important\r\nconsequences. It proves incontestably, that the judiciary is beyond\r\ncomparison the weakest of the three departments of power1; that\r\nit can never attack with success either of the other two; and that\r\nall possible care is requisite to enable it to defend itself against\r\ntheir attacks. It equally proves, that though individual oppression\r\nmay now and then proceed from the courts of justice, the general\r\nliberty of the people can never be endangered from that quarter; I\r\nmean so long as the judiciary remains truly distinct from both the\r\nlegislature and the Executive. For I agree, that \"there is no\r\nliberty, if the power of judging be not separated from the\r\nlegislative and executive powers.\"2 And it proves, in the last\r\nplace, that as liberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary\r\nalone, but would have every thing to fear from its union with either\r\nof the other departments; that as all the effects of such a union\r\nmust ensue from a dependence of the former on the latter,\r\nnotwithstanding a nominal and apparent separation; that as, from\r\nthe natural feebleness of the judiciary, it is in continual jeopardy\r\nof being overpowered, awed, or influenced by its co-ordinate\r\nbranches; and that as nothing can contribute so much to its\r\nfirmness and independence as permanency in office, this quality may\r\ntherefore be justly regarded as an indispensable ingredient in its\r\nconstitution, and, in a great measure, as the citadel of the public\r\njustice and the public security.\r\n\r\nThe complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly\r\nessential in a limited Constitution. By a limited Constitution, I\r\nunderstand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the\r\nlegislative authority; such, for instance, as that it shall pass no\r\nbills of attainder, no ex-post-facto laws, and the like.\r\nLimitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way\r\nthan through the medium of courts of justice, whose duty it must be\r\nto declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the\r\nConstitution void. Without this, all the reservations of particular\r\nrights or privileges would amount to nothing.\r\n\r\nSome perplexity respecting the rights of the courts to pronounce\r\nlegislative acts void, because contrary to the Constitution, has\r\narisen from an imagination that the doctrine would imply a\r\nsuperiority of the judiciary to the legislative power. It is urged\r\nthat the authority which can declare the acts of another void, must\r\nnecessarily be superior to the one whose acts may be declared void.\r\nAs this doctrine is of great importance in all the American\r\nconstitutions, a brief discussion of the ground on which it rests\r\ncannot be unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThere is no position which depends on clearer principles, than\r\nthat every act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of\r\nthe commission under which it is exercised, is void. No legislative\r\nact, therefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid. To deny\r\nthis, would be to affirm, that the deputy is greater than his\r\nprincipal; that the servant is above his master; that the\r\nrepresentatives of the people are superior to the people themselves;\r\nthat men acting by virtue of powers, may do not only what their\r\npowers do not authorize, but what they forbid.\r\n\r\nIf it be said that the legislative body are themselves the\r\nconstitutional judges of their own powers, and that the construction\r\nthey put upon them is conclusive upon the other departments, it may\r\nbe answered, that this cannot be the natural presumption, where it\r\nis not to be collected from any particular provisions in the\r\nConstitution. It is not otherwise to be supposed, that the\r\nConstitution could intend to enable the representatives of the\r\npeople to substitute their WILL to that of their constituents. It\r\nis far more rational to suppose, that the courts were designed to be\r\nan intermediate body between the people and the legislature, in\r\norder, among other things, to keep the latter within the limits\r\nassigned to their authority. The interpretation of the laws is the\r\nproper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution is, in\r\nfact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It\r\ntherefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the\r\nmeaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body.\r\nIf there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the\r\ntwo, that which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of\r\ncourse, to be preferred; or, in other words, the Constitution ought\r\nto be preferred to the statute, the intention of the people to the\r\nintention of their agents.\r\n\r\nNor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of\r\nthe judicial to the legislative power. It only supposes that the\r\npower of the people is superior to both; and that where the will of\r\nthe legislature, declared in its statutes, stands in opposition to\r\nthat of the people, declared in the Constitution, the judges ought\r\nto be governed by the latter rather than the former. They ought to\r\nregulate their decisions by the fundamental laws, rather than by\r\nthose which are not fundamental.\r\n\r\nThis exercise of judicial discretion, in determining between two\r\ncontradictory laws, is exemplified in a familiar instance. It not\r\nuncommonly happens, that there are two statutes existing at one\r\ntime, clashing in whole or in part with each other, and neither of\r\nthem containing any repealing clause or expression. In such a case,\r\nit is the province of the courts to liquidate and fix their meaning\r\nand operation. So far as they can, by any fair construction, be\r\nreconciled to each other, reason and law conspire to dictate that\r\nthis should be done; where this is impracticable, it becomes a\r\nmatter of necessity to give effect to one, in exclusion of the other.\r\nThe rule which has obtained in the courts for determining their\r\nrelative validity is, that the last in order of time shall be\r\npreferred to the first. But this is a mere rule of construction,\r\nnot derived from any positive law, but from the nature and reason of\r\nthe thing. It is a rule not enjoined upon the courts by legislative\r\nprovision, but adopted by themselves, as consonant to truth and\r\npropriety, for the direction of their conduct as interpreters of the\r\nlaw. They thought it reasonable, that between the interfering acts\r\nof an EQUAL authority, that which was the last indication of its\r\nwill should have the preference.\r\n\r\nBut in regard to the interfering acts of a superior and\r\nsubordinate authority, of an original and derivative power, the\r\nnature and reason of the thing indicate the converse of that rule as\r\nproper to be followed. They teach us that the prior act of a\r\nsuperior ought to be preferred to the subsequent act of an inferior\r\nand subordinate authority; and that accordingly, whenever a\r\nparticular statute contravenes the Constitution, it will be the duty\r\nof the judicial tribunals to adhere to the latter and disregard the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nIt can be of no weight to say that the courts, on the pretense\r\nof a repugnancy, may substitute their own pleasure to the\r\nconstitutional intentions of the legislature. This might as well\r\nhappen in the case of two contradictory statutes; or it might as\r\nwell happen in every adjudication upon any single statute. The\r\ncourts must declare the sense of the law; and if they should be\r\ndisposed to exercise WILL instead of JUDGMENT, the consequence would\r\nequally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the\r\nlegislative body. The observation, if it prove any thing, would\r\nprove that there ought to be no judges distinct from that body.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the courts of justice are to be considered as the\r\nbulwarks of a limited Constitution against legislative\r\nencroachments, this consideration will afford a strong argument for\r\nthe permanent tenure of judicial offices, since nothing will\r\ncontribute so much as this to that independent spirit in the judges\r\nwhich must be essential to the faithful performance of so arduous a\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nThis independence of the judges is equally requisite to guard\r\nthe Constitution and the rights of individuals from the effects of\r\nthose ill humors, which the arts of designing men, or the influence\r\nof particular conjunctures, sometimes disseminate among the people\r\nthemselves, and which, though they speedily give place to better\r\ninformation, and more deliberate reflection, have a tendency, in the\r\nmeantime, to occasion dangerous innovations in the government, and\r\nserious oppressions of the minor party in the community. Though I\r\ntrust the friends of the proposed Constitution will never concur\r\nwith its enemies,3 in questioning that fundamental principle of\r\nrepublican government, which admits the right of the people to alter\r\nor abolish the established Constitution, whenever they find it\r\ninconsistent with their happiness, yet it is not to be inferred from\r\nthis principle, that the representatives of the people, whenever a\r\nmomentary inclination happens to lay hold of a majority of their\r\nconstituents, incompatible with the provisions in the existing\r\nConstitution, would, on that account, be justifiable in a violation\r\nof those provisions; or that the courts would be under a greater\r\nobligation to connive at infractions in this shape, than when they\r\nhad proceeded wholly from the cabals of the representative body.\r\nUntil the people have, by some solemn and authoritative act,\r\nannulled or changed the established form, it is binding upon\r\nthemselves collectively, as well as individually; and no\r\npresumption, or even knowledge, of their sentiments, can warrant\r\ntheir representatives in a departure from it, prior to such an act.\r\nBut it is easy to see, that it would require an uncommon portion of\r\nfortitude in the judges to do their duty as faithful guardians of\r\nthe Constitution, where legislative invasions of it had been\r\ninstigated by the major voice of the community.\r\n\r\nBut it is not with a view to infractions of the Constitution\r\nonly, that the independence of the judges may be an essential\r\nsafeguard against the effects of occasional ill humors in the\r\nsociety. These sometimes extend no farther than to the injury of\r\nthe private rights of particular classes of citizens, by unjust and\r\npartial laws. Here also the firmness of the judicial magistracy is\r\nof vast importance in mitigating the severity and confining the\r\noperation of such laws. It not only serves to moderate the\r\nimmediate mischiefs of those which may have been passed, but it\r\noperates as a check upon the legislative body in passing them; who,\r\nperceiving that obstacles to the success of iniquitous intention are\r\nto be expected from the scruples of the courts, are in a manner\r\ncompelled, by the very motives of the injustice they meditate, to\r\nqualify their attempts. This is a circumstance calculated to have\r\nmore influence upon the character of our governments, than but few\r\nmay be aware of. The benefits of the integrity and moderation of\r\nthe judiciary have already been felt in more States than one; and\r\nthough they may have displeased those whose sinister expectations\r\nthey may have disappointed, they must have commanded the esteem and\r\napplause of all the virtuous and disinterested. Considerate men, of\r\nevery description, ought to prize whatever will tend to beget or\r\nfortify that temper in the courts: as no man can be sure that he\r\nmay not be to-morrow the victim of a spirit of injustice, by which\r\nhe may be a gainer to-day. And every man must now feel, that the\r\ninevitable tendency of such a spirit is to sap the foundations of\r\npublic and private confidence, and to introduce in its stead\r\nuniversal distrust and distress.\r\n\r\nThat inflexible and uniform adherence to the rights of the\r\nConstitution, and of individuals, which we perceive to be\r\nindispensable in the courts of justice, can certainly not be\r\nexpected from judges who hold their offices by a temporary\r\ncommission. Periodical appointments, however regulated, or by\r\nwhomsoever made, would, in some way or other, be fatal to their\r\nnecessary independence. If the power of making them was committed\r\neither to the Executive or legislature, there would be danger of an\r\nimproper complaisance to the branch which possessed it; if to both,\r\nthere would be an unwillingness to hazard the displeasure of either;\r\nif to the people, or to persons chosen by them for the special\r\npurpose, there would be too great a disposition to consult\r\npopularity, to justify a reliance that nothing would be consulted\r\nbut the Constitution and the laws.\r\n\r\nThere is yet a further and a weightier reason for the permanency\r\nof the judicial offices, which is deducible from the nature of the\r\nqualifications they require. It has been frequently remarked, with\r\ngreat propriety, that a voluminous code of laws is one of the\r\ninconveniences necessarily connected with the advantages of a free\r\ngovernment. To avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is\r\nindispensable that they should be bound down by strict rules and\r\nprecedents, which serve to define and point out their duty in every\r\nparticular case that comes before them; and it will readily be\r\nconceived from the variety of controversies which grow out of the\r\nfolly and wickedness of mankind, that the records of those\r\nprecedents must unavoidably swell to a very considerable bulk, and\r\nmust demand long and laborious study to acquire a competent\r\nknowledge of them. Hence it is, that there can be but few men in\r\nthe society who will have sufficient skill in the laws to qualify\r\nthem for the stations of judges. And making the proper deductions\r\nfor the ordinary depravity of human nature, the number must be still\r\nsmaller of those who unite the requisite integrity with the\r\nrequisite knowledge. These considerations apprise us, that the\r\ngovernment can have no great option between fit character; and that\r\na temporary duration in office, which would naturally discourage\r\nsuch characters from quitting a lucrative line of practice to accept\r\na seat on the bench, would have a tendency to throw the\r\nadministration of justice into hands less able, and less well\r\nqualified, to conduct it with utility and dignity. In the present\r\ncircumstances of this country, and in those in which it is likely to\r\nbe for a long time to come, the disadvantages on this score would be\r\ngreater than they may at first sight appear; but it must be\r\nconfessed, that they are far inferior to those which present\r\nthemselves under the other aspects of the subject.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, there can be no room to doubt that the\r\nconvention acted wisely in copying from the models of those\r\nconstitutions which have established GOOD BEHAVIOR as the tenure of\r\ntheir judicial offices, in point of duration; and that so far from\r\nbeing blamable on this account, their plan would have been\r\ninexcusably defective, if it had wanted this important feature of\r\ngood government. The experience of Great Britain affords an\r\nillustrious comment on the excellence of the institution.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n1 The celebrated Montesquieu, speaking of them, says: \"Of the\r\nthree powers above mentioned, the judiciary is next to\r\nnothing.\" \"Spirit of Laws.\" vol. i., page 186.\r\n\r\n2 Idem, page 181.\r\n\r\n3 Vide \"Protest of the Minority of the Convention of\r\nPennsylvania,\" Martin's Speech, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 79\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Judiciary Continued\r\n\r\nFrom MCLEAN's Edition, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nNEXT to permanency in office, nothing can contribute more to the\r\nindependence of the judges than a fixed provision for their support.\r\nThe remark made in relation to the President is equally applicable\r\nhere. In the general course of human nature, A POWER OVER A MAN's\r\nSUBSISTENCE AMOUNTS TO A POWER OVER HIS WILL. And we can never hope\r\nto see realized in practice, the complete separation of the judicial\r\nfrom the legislative power, in any system which leaves the former\r\ndependent for pecuniary resources on the occasional grants of the\r\nlatter. The enlightened friends to good government in every State,\r\nhave seen cause to lament the want of precise and explicit\r\nprecautions in the State constitutions on this head. Some of these\r\nindeed have declared that PERMANENT1 salaries should be\r\nestablished for the judges; but the experiment has in some\r\ninstances shown that such expressions are not sufficiently definite\r\nto preclude legislative evasions. Something still more positive and\r\nunequivocal has been evinced to be requisite. The plan of the\r\nconvention accordingly has provided that the judges of the United\r\nStates \"shall at STATED TIMES receive for their services a\r\ncompensation which shall not be DIMINISHED during their continuance\r\nin office.\"\r\n\r\nThis, all circumstances considered, is the most eligible\r\nprovision that could have been devised. It will readily be\r\nunderstood that the fluctuations in the value of money and in the\r\nstate of society rendered a fixed rate of compensation in the\r\nConstitution inadmissible. What might be extravagant to-day, might\r\nin half a century become penurious and inadequate. It was therefore\r\nnecessary to leave it to the discretion of the legislature to vary\r\nits provisions in conformity to the variations in circumstances, yet\r\nunder such restrictions as to put it out of the power of that body\r\nto change the condition of the individual for the worse. A man may\r\nthen be sure of the ground upon which he stands, and can never be\r\ndeterred from his duty by the apprehension of being placed in a less\r\neligible situation. The clause which has been quoted combines both\r\nadvantages. The salaries of judicial officers may from time to time\r\nbe altered, as occasion shall require, yet so as never to lessen the\r\nallowance with which any particular judge comes into office, in\r\nrespect to him. It will be observed that a difference has been made\r\nby the convention between the compensation of the President and of\r\nthe judges, That of the former can neither be increased nor\r\ndiminished; that of the latter can only not be diminished. This\r\nprobably arose from the difference in the duration of the respective\r\noffices. As the President is to be elected for no more than four\r\nyears, it can rarely happen that an adequate salary, fixed at the\r\ncommencement of that period, will not continue to be such to its end.\r\nBut with regard to the judges, who, if they behave properly, will\r\nbe secured in their places for life, it may well happen, especially\r\nin the early stages of the government, that a stipend, which would\r\nbe very sufficient at their first appointment, would become too\r\nsmall in the progress of their service.\r\n\r\nThis provision for the support of the judges bears every mark of\r\nprudence and efficacy; and it may be safely affirmed that, together\r\nwith the permanent tenure of their offices, it affords a better\r\nprospect of their independence than is discoverable in the\r\nconstitutions of any of the States in regard to their own judges.\r\n\r\nThe precautions for their responsibility are comprised in the\r\narticle respecting impeachments. They are liable to be impeached\r\nfor malconduct by the House of Representatives, and tried by the\r\nSenate; and, if convicted, may be dismissed from office, and\r\ndisqualified for holding any other. This is the only provision on\r\nthe point which is consistent with the necessary independence of the\r\njudicial character, and is the only one which we find in our own\r\nConstitution in respect to our own judges.\r\n\r\nThe want of a provision for removing the judges on account of\r\ninability has been a subject of complaint. But all considerate men\r\nwill be sensible that such a provision would either not be practiced\r\nupon or would be more liable to abuse than calculated to answer any\r\ngood purpose. The mensuration of the faculties of the mind has, I\r\nbelieve, no place in the catalogue of known arts. An attempt to fix\r\nthe boundary between the regions of ability and inability, would\r\nmuch oftener give scope to personal and party attachments and\r\nenmities than advance the interests of justice or the public good.\r\nThe result, except in the case of insanity, must for the most part\r\nbe arbitrary; and insanity, without any formal or express\r\nprovision, may be safely pronounced to be a virtual disqualification.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of New York, to avoid investigations that must\r\nforever be vague and dangerous, has taken a particular age as the\r\ncriterion of inability. No man can be a judge beyond sixty. I\r\nbelieve there are few at present who do not disapprove of this\r\nprovision. There is no station, in relation to which it is less\r\nproper than to that of a judge. The deliberating and comparing\r\nfaculties generally preserve their strength much beyond that period\r\nin men who survive it; and when, in addition to this circumstance,\r\nwe consider how few there are who outlive the season of intellectual\r\nvigor, and how improbable it is that any considerable portion of the\r\nbench, whether more or less numerous, should be in such a situation\r\nat the same time, we shall be ready to conclude that limitations of\r\nthis sort have little to recommend them. In a republic, where\r\nfortunes are not affluent, and pensions not expedient, the\r\ndismission of men from stations in which they have served their\r\ncountry long and usefully, on which they depend for subsistence, and\r\nfrom which it will be too late to resort to any other occupation for\r\na livelihood, ought to have some better apology to humanity than is\r\nto be found in the imaginary danger of a superannuated bench.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n1 Vide \"Constitution of Massachusetts,\" chapter 2, section\r\nI, article 13.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 80\r\n\r\nThe Powers of the Judiciary\r\n\r\nFrom McLEAN's Edition, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTo JUDGE with accuracy of the proper extent of the federal\r\njudicature, it will be necessary to consider, in the first place,\r\nwhat are its proper objects.\r\n\r\nIt seems scarcely to admit of controversy, that the judicary\r\nauthority of the Union ought to extend to these several descriptions\r\nof cases: 1st, to all those which arise out of the laws of the\r\nUnited States, passed in pursuance of their just and constitutional\r\npowers of legislation; 2d, to all those which concern the execution\r\nof the provisions expressly contained in the articles of Union; 3d,\r\nto all those in which the United States are a party; 4th, to all\r\nthose which involve the PEACE of the CONFEDERACY, whether they\r\nrelate to the intercourse between the United States and foreign\r\nnations, or to that between the States themselves; 5th, to all\r\nthose which originate on the high seas, and are of admiralty or\r\nmaritime jurisdiction; and, lastly, to all those in which the State\r\ntribunals cannot be supposed to be impartial and unbiased.\r\n\r\nThe first point depends upon this obvious consideration, that\r\nthere ought always to be a constitutional method of giving efficacy\r\nto constitutional provisions. What, for instance, would avail\r\nrestrictions on the authority of the State legislatures, without\r\nsome constitutional mode of enforcing the observance of them? The\r\nStates, by the plan of the convention, are prohibited from doing a\r\nvariety of things, some of which are incompatible with the interests\r\nof the Union, and others with the principles of good government.\r\nThe imposition of duties on imported articles, and the emission of\r\npaper money, are specimens of each kind. No man of sense will\r\nbelieve, that such prohibitions would be scrupulously regarded,\r\nwithout some effectual power in the government to restrain or\r\ncorrect the infractions of them. This power must either be a direct\r\nnegative on the State laws, or an authority in the federal courts to\r\noverrule such as might be in manifest contravention of the articles\r\nof Union. There is no third course that I can imagine. The latter\r\nappears to have been thought by the convention preferable to the\r\nformer, and, I presume, will be most agreeable to the States.\r\n\r\nAs to the second point, it is impossible, by any argument or\r\ncomment, to make it clearer than it is in itself. If there are such\r\nthings as political axioms, the propriety of the judicial power of a\r\ngovernment being coextensive with its legislative, may be ranked\r\namong the number. The mere necessity of uniformity in the\r\ninterpretation of the national laws, decides the question. Thirteen\r\nindependent courts of final jurisdiction over the same causes,\r\narising upon the same laws, is a hydra in government, from which\r\nnothing but contradiction and confusion can proceed.\r\n\r\nStill less need be said in regard to the third point.\r\nControversies between the nation and its members or citizens, can\r\nonly be properly referred to the national tribunals. Any other plan\r\nwould be contrary to reason, to precedent, and to decorum.\r\n\r\nThe fourth point rests on this plain proposition, that the peace\r\nof the WHOLE ought not to be left at the disposal of a PART. The\r\nUnion will undoubtedly be answerable to foreign powers for the\r\nconduct of its members. And the responsibility for an injury ought\r\never to be accompanied with the faculty of preventing it. As the\r\ndenial or perversion of justice by the sentences of courts, as well\r\nas in any other manner, is with reason classed among the just causes\r\nof war, it will follow that the federal judiciary ought to have\r\ncognizance of all causes in which the citizens of other countries\r\nare concerned. This is not less essential to the preservation of\r\nthe public faith, than to the security of the public tranquillity.\r\nA distinction may perhaps be imagined between cases arising upon\r\ntreaties and the laws of nations and those which may stand merely on\r\nthe footing of the municipal law. The former kind may be supposed\r\nproper for the federal jurisdiction, the latter for that of the\r\nStates. But it is at least problematical, whether an unjust\r\nsentence against a foreigner, where the subject of controversy was\r\nwholly relative to the lex loci, would not, if unredressed, be\r\nan aggression upon his sovereign, as well as one which violated the\r\nstipulations of a treaty or the general law of nations. And a still\r\ngreater objection to the distinction would result from the immense\r\ndifficulty, if not impossibility, of a practical discrimination\r\nbetween the cases of one complexion and those of the other. So\r\ngreat a proportion of the cases in which foreigners are parties,\r\ninvolve national questions, that it is by far most safe and most\r\nexpedient to refer all those in which they are concerned to the\r\nnational tribunals.\r\n\r\nThe power of determining causes between two States, between one\r\nState and the citizens of another, and between the citizens of\r\ndifferent States, is perhaps not less essential to the peace of the\r\nUnion than that which has been just examined. History gives us a\r\nhorrid picture of the dissensions and private wars which distracted\r\nand desolated Germany prior to the institution of the Imperial\r\nChamber by Maximilian, towards the close of the fifteenth century;\r\nand informs us, at the same time, of the vast influence of that\r\ninstitution in appeasing the disorders and establishing the\r\ntranquillity of the empire. This was a court invested with\r\nauthority to decide finally all differences among the members of the\r\nGermanic body.\r\n\r\nA method of terminating territorial disputes between the States,\r\nunder the authority of the federal head, was not unattended to, even\r\nin the imperfect system by which they have been hitherto held\r\ntogether. But there are many other sources, besides interfering\r\nclaims of boundary, from which bickerings and animosities may spring\r\nup among the members of the Union. To some of these we have been\r\nwitnesses in the course of our past experience. It will readily be\r\nconjectured that I allude to the fraudulent laws which have been\r\npassed in too many of the States. And though the proposed\r\nConstitution establishes particular guards against the repetition of\r\nthose instances which have heretofore made their appearance, yet it\r\nis warrantable to apprehend that the spirit which produced them will\r\nassume new shapes, that could not be foreseen nor specifically\r\nprovided against. Whatever practices may have a tendency to disturb\r\nthe harmony between the States, are proper objects of federal\r\nsuperintendence and control.\r\n\r\nIt may be esteemed the basis of the Union, that \"the citizens\r\nof each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities\r\nof citizens of the several States.\" And if it be a just principle\r\nthat every government OUGHT TO POSSESS THE MEANS OF EXECUTING ITS\r\nOWN PROVISIONS BY ITS OWN AUTHORITY, it will follow, that in order\r\nto the inviolable maintenance of that equality of privileges and\r\nimmunities to which the citizens of the Union will be entitled, the\r\nnational judiciary ought to preside in all cases in which one State\r\nor its citizens are opposed to another State or its citizens. To\r\nsecure the full effect of so fundamental a provision against all\r\nevasion and subterfuge, it is necessary that its construction should\r\nbe committed to that tribunal which, having no local attachments,\r\nwill be likely to be impartial between the different States and\r\ntheir citizens, and which, owing its official existence to the\r\nUnion, will never be likely to feel any bias inauspicious to the\r\nprinciples on which it is founded.\r\n\r\nThe fifth point will demand little animadversion. The most\r\nbigoted idolizers of State authority have not thus far shown a\r\ndisposition to deny the national judiciary the cognizances of\r\nmaritime causes. These so generally depend on the laws of nations,\r\nand so commonly affect the rights of foreigners, that they fall\r\nwithin the considerations which are relative to the public peace.\r\nThe most important part of them are, by the present Confederation,\r\nsubmitted to federal jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe reasonableness of the agency of the national courts in cases\r\nin which the State tribunals cannot be supposed to be impartial,\r\nspeaks for itself. No man ought certainly to be a judge in his own\r\ncause, or in any cause in respect to which he has the least interest\r\nor bias. This principle has no inconsiderable weight in designating\r\nthe federal courts as the proper tribunals for the determination of\r\ncontroversies between different States and their citizens. And it\r\nought to have the same operation in regard to some cases between\r\ncitizens of the same State. Claims to land under grants of\r\ndifferent States, founded upon adverse pretensions of boundary, are\r\nof this description. The courts of neither of the granting States\r\ncould be expected to be unbiased. The laws may have even prejudged\r\nthe question, and tied the courts down to decisions in favor of the\r\ngrants of the State to which they belonged. And even where this had\r\nnot been done, it would be natural that the judges, as men, should\r\nfeel a strong predilection to the claims of their own government.\r\n\r\nHaving thus laid down and discussed the principles which ought\r\nto regulate the constitution of the federal judiciary, we will\r\nproceed to test, by these principles, the particular powers of\r\nwhich, according to the plan of the convention, it is to be composed.\r\nIt is to comprehend \"all cases in law and equity arising under\r\nthe Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made,\r\nor which shall be made, under their authority; to all cases\r\naffecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls; to all\r\ncases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies to\r\nwhich the United States shall be a party; to controversies between\r\ntwo or more States; between a State and citizens of another State;\r\nbetween citizens of different States; between citizens of the same\r\nState claiming lands and grants of different States; and between a\r\nState or the citizens thereof and foreign states, citizens, and\r\nsubjects.\" This constitutes the entire mass of the judicial\r\nauthority of the Union. Let us now review it in detail. It is,\r\nthen, to extend:\r\n\r\nFirst. To all cases in law and equity, ARISING UNDER THE\r\nCONSTITUTION and THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. This corresponds\r\nwith the two first classes of causes, which have been enumerated, as\r\nproper for the jurisdiction of the United States. It has been\r\nasked, what is meant by \"cases arising under the Constitution,\" in\r\ncontradiction from those \"arising under the laws of the United\r\nStates\"? The difference has been already explained. All the\r\nrestrictions upon the authority of the State legislatures furnish\r\nexamples of it. They are not, for instance, to emit paper money;\r\nbut the interdiction results from the Constitution, and will have\r\nno connection with any law of the United States. Should paper\r\nmoney, notwithstanding, be emited, the controversies concerning it\r\nwould be cases arising under the Constitution and not the laws of\r\nthe United States, in the ordinary signification of the terms. This\r\nmay serve as a sample of the whole.\r\n\r\nIt has also been asked, what need of the word \"equity What\r\nequitable causes can grow out of the Constitution and laws of the\r\nUnited States? There is hardly a subject of litigation between\r\nindividuals, which may not involve those ingredients of FRAUD,\r\nACCIDENT, TRUST, or HARDSHIP, which would render the matter an\r\nobject of equitable rather than of legal jurisdiction, as the\r\ndistinction is known and established in several of the States. It\r\nis the peculiar province, for instance, of a court of equity to\r\nrelieve against what are called hard bargains: these are contracts\r\nin which, though there may have been no direct fraud or deceit,\r\nsufficient to invalidate them in a court of law, yet there may have\r\nbeen some undue and unconscionable advantage taken of the\r\nnecessities or misfortunes of one of the parties, which a court of\r\nequity would not tolerate. In such cases, where foreigners were\r\nconcerned on either side, it would be impossible for the federal\r\njudicatories to do justice without an equitable as well as a legal\r\njurisdiction. Agreements to convey lands claimed under the grants\r\nof different States, may afford another example of the necessity of\r\nan equitable jurisdiction in the federal courts. This reasoning may\r\nnot be so palpable in those States where the formal and technical\r\ndistinction between LAW and EQUITY is not maintained, as in this\r\nState, where it is exemplified by every day's practice.\r\n\r\nThe judiciary authority of the Union is to extend:\r\n\r\nSecond. To treaties made, or which shall be made, under the\r\nauthority of the United States, and to all cases affecting\r\nambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls. These belong to\r\nthe fourth class of the enumerated cases, as they have an evident\r\nconnection with the preservation of the national peace.\r\n\r\nThird. To cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.\r\nThese form, altogether, the fifth of the enumerated classes of\r\ncauses proper for the cognizance of the national courts.\r\n\r\nFourth. To controversies to which the United States shall be\r\na party. These constitute the third of those classes.\r\n\r\nFifth. To controversies between two or more States; between\r\na State and citizens of another State; between citizens of\r\ndifferent States. These belong to the fourth of those classes, and\r\npartake, in some measure, of the nature of the last.\r\n\r\nSixth. To cases between the citizens of the same State,\r\nCLAIMING LANDS UNDER GRANTS OF DIFFERENT STATES. These fall within\r\nthe last class, and ARE THE ONLY INSTANCES IN WHICH THE PROPOSED\r\nCONSTITUTION DIRECTLY CONTEMPLATES THE COGNIZANCE OF DISPUTES\r\nBETWEEN THE CITIZENS OF THE SAME STATE.\r\n\r\nSeventh. To cases between a State and the citizens thereof,\r\nand foreign States, citizens, or subjects. These have been already\r\nexplained to belong to the fourth of the enumerated classes, and\r\nhave been shown to be, in a peculiar manner, the proper subjects of\r\nthe national judicature.\r\n\r\nFrom this review of the particular powers of the federal\r\njudiciary, as marked out in the Constitution, it appears that they\r\nare all conformable to the principles which ought to have governed\r\nthe structure of that department, and which were necessary to the\r\nperfection of the system. If some partial inconviences should\r\nappear to be connected with the incorporation of any of them into\r\nthe plan, it ought to be recollected that the national legislature\r\nwill have ample authority to make such EXCEPTIONS, and to prescribe\r\nsuch regulations as will be calculated to obviate or remove these\r\ninconveniences. The possibility of particular mischiefs can never\r\nbe viewed, by a wellinformed mind, as a solid objection to a general\r\nprinciple, which is calculated to avoid general mischiefs and to\r\nobtain general advantages.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST. No. 81\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Judiciary Continued, and the Distribution of the Judicial\r\nAuthority\r\n\r\nFrom McLEAN's Edition, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nLET US now return to the partition of the judiciary authority\r\nbetween different courts, and their relations to each other,\r\n\"The judicial power of the United States is\" (by the plan of\r\nthe convention) \"to be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such\r\ninferior courts as the Congress may, from time to time, ordain and\r\nestablish.\"1\r\n\r\nThat there ought to be one court of supreme and final\r\njurisdiction, is a proposition which is not likely to be contested.\r\nThe reasons for it have been assigned in another place, and are too\r\nobvious to need repetition. The only question that seems to have\r\nbeen raised concerning it, is, whether it ought to be a distinct\r\nbody or a branch of the legislature. The same contradiction is\r\nobservable in regard to this matter which has been remarked in\r\nseveral other cases. The very men who object to the Senate as a\r\ncourt of impeachments, on the ground of an improper intermixture of\r\npowers, advocate, by implication at least, the propriety of vesting\r\nthe ultimate decision of all causes, in the whole or in a part of\r\nthe legislative body.\r\n\r\nThe arguments, or rather suggestions, upon which this charge is\r\nfounded, are to this effect: \"The authority of the proposed\r\nSupreme Court of the United States, which is to be a separate and\r\nindependent body, will be superior to that of the legislature. The\r\npower of construing the laws according to the SPIRIT of the\r\nConstitution, will enable that court to mould them into whatever\r\nshape it may think proper; especially as its decisions will not be\r\nin any manner subject to the revision or correction of the\r\nlegislative body. This is as unprecedented as it is dangerous. In\r\nBritain, the judical power, in the last resort, resides in the House\r\nof Lords, which is a branch of the legislature; and this part of\r\nthe British government has been imitated in the State constitutions\r\nin general. The Parliament of Great Britain, and the legislatures\r\nof the several States, can at any time rectify, by law, the\r\nexceptionable decisions of their respective courts. But the errors\r\nand usurpations of the Supreme Court of the United States will be\r\nuncontrollable and remediless.\" This, upon examination, will be\r\nfound to be made up altogether of false reasoning upon misconceived\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, there is not a syllable in the plan under\r\nconsideration which DIRECTLY empowers the national courts to\r\nconstrue the laws according to the spirit of the Constitution, or\r\nwhich gives them any greater latitude in this respect than may be\r\nclaimed by the courts of every State. I admit, however, that the\r\nConstitution ought to be the standard of construction for the laws,\r\nand that wherever there is an evident opposition, the laws ought to\r\ngive place to the Constitution. But this doctrine is not deducible\r\nfrom any circumstance peculiar to the plan of the convention, but\r\nfrom the general theory of a limited Constitution; and as far as it\r\nis true, is equally applicable to most, if not to all the State\r\ngovernments. There can be no objection, therefore, on this account,\r\nto the federal judicature which will not lie against the local\r\njudicatures in general, and which will not serve to condemn every\r\nconstitution that attempts to set bounds to legislative discretion.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the force of the objection may be thought to consist\r\nin the particular organization of the Supreme Court; in its being\r\ncomposed of a distinct body of magistrates, instead of being one of\r\nthe branches of the legislature, as in the government of Great\r\nBritain and that of the State. To insist upon this point, the\r\nauthors of the objection must renounce the meaning they have labored\r\nto annex to the celebrated maxim, requiring a separation of the\r\ndepartments of power. It shall, nevertheless, be conceded to them,\r\nagreeably to the interpretation given to that maxim in the course of\r\nthese papers, that it is not violated by vesting the ultimate power\r\nof judging in a PART of the legislative body. But though this be\r\nnot an absolute violation of that excellent rule, yet it verges so\r\nnearly upon it, as on this account alone to be less eligible than\r\nthe mode preferred by the convention. From a body which had even a\r\npartial agency in passing bad laws, we could rarely expect a\r\ndisposition to temper and moderate them in the application. The\r\nsame spirit which had operated in making them, would be too apt in\r\ninterpreting them; still less could it be expected that men who had\r\ninfringed the Constitution in the character of legislators, would be\r\ndisposed to repair the breach in the character of judges. Nor is\r\nthis all. Every reason which recommends the tenure of good behavior\r\nfor judicial offices, militates against placing the judiciary power,\r\nin the last resort, in a body composed of men chosen for a limited\r\nperiod. There is an absurdity in referring the determination of\r\ncauses, in the first instance, to judges of permanent standing; in\r\nthe last, to those of a temporary and mutable constitution. And\r\nthere is a still greater absurdity in subjecting the decisions of\r\nmen, selected for their knowledge of the laws, acquired by long and\r\nlaborious study, to the revision and control of men who, for want of\r\nthe same advantage, cannot but be deficient in that knowledge. The\r\nmembers of the legislature will rarely be chosen with a view to\r\nthose qualifications which fit men for the stations of judges; and\r\nas, on this account, there will be great reason to apprehend all the\r\nill consequences of defective information, so, on account of the\r\nnatural propensity of such bodies to party divisions, there will be\r\nno less reason to fear that the pestilential breath of faction may\r\npoison the fountains of justice. The habit of being continually\r\nmarshalled on opposite sides will be too apt to stifle the voice\r\nboth of law and of equity.\r\n\r\nThese considerations teach us to applaud the wisdom of those\r\nStates who have committed the judicial power, in the last resort,\r\nnot to a part of the legislature, but to distinct and independent\r\nbodies of men. Contrary to the supposition of those who have\r\nrepresented the plan of the convention, in this respect, as novel\r\nand unprecedented, it is but a copy of the constitutions of New\r\nHampshire, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland,\r\nVirginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia; and the\r\npreference which has been given to those models is highly to be\r\ncommended.\r\n\r\nIt is not true, in the second place, that the Parliament of\r\nGreat Britain, or the legislatures of the particular States, can\r\nrectify the exceptionable decisions of their respective courts, in\r\nany other sense than might be done by a future legislature of the\r\nUnited States. The theory, neither of the British, nor the State\r\nconstitutions, authorizes the revisal of a judicial sentence by a\r\nlegislative act. Nor is there any thing in the proposed\r\nConstitution, more than in either of them, by which it is forbidden.\r\nIn the former, as well as in the latter, the impropriety of the\r\nthing, on the general principles of law and reason, is the sole\r\nobstacle. A legislature, without exceeding its province, cannot\r\nreverse a determination once made in a particular case; though it\r\nmay prescribe a new rule for future cases. This is the principle,\r\nand it applies in all its consequences, exactly in the same manner\r\nand extent, to the State governments, as to the national government\r\nnow under consideration. Not the least difference can be pointed\r\nout in any view of the subject.\r\n\r\nIt may in the last place be observed that the supposed danger of\r\njudiciary encroachments on the legislative authority, which has been\r\nupon many occasions reiterated, is in reality a phantom. Particular\r\nmisconstructions and contraventions of the will of the legislature\r\nmay now and then happen; but they can never be so extensive as to\r\namount to an inconvenience, or in any sensible degree to affect the\r\norder of the political system. This may be inferred with certainty,\r\nfrom the general nature of the judicial power, from the objects to\r\nwhich it relates, from the manner in which it is exercised, from its\r\ncomparative weakness, and from its total incapacity to support its\r\nusurpations by force. And the inference is greatly fortified by the\r\nconsideration of the important constitutional check which the power\r\nof instituting impeachments in one part of the legislative body, and\r\nof determining upon them in the other, would give to that body upon\r\nthe members of the judicial department. This is alone a complete\r\nsecurity. There never can be danger that the judges, by a series of\r\ndeliberate usurpations on the authority of the legislature, would\r\nhazard the united resentment of the body intrusted with it, while\r\nthis body was possessed of the means of punishing their presumption,\r\nby degrading them from their stations. While this ought to remove\r\nall apprehensions on the subject, it affords, at the same time, a\r\ncogent argument for constituting the Senate a court for the trial of\r\nimpeachments.\r\n\r\nHaving now examined, and, I trust, removed the objections to the\r\ndistinct and independent organization of the Supreme Court, I\r\nproceed to consider the propriety of the power of constituting\r\ninferior courts,2 and the relations which will subsist between\r\nthese and the former.\r\n\r\nThe power of constituting inferior courts is evidently\r\ncalculated to obviate the necessity of having recourse to the\r\nSupreme Court in every case of federal cognizance. It is intended\r\nto enable the national government to institute or AUTHORUZE, in each\r\nState or district of the United States, a tribunal competent to the\r\ndetermination of matters of national jurisdiction within its limits.\r\n\r\nBut why, it is asked, might not the same purpose have been\r\naccomplished by the instrumentality of the State courts? This\r\nadmits of different answers. Though the fitness and competency of\r\nthose courts should be allowed in the utmost latitude, yet the\r\nsubstance of the power in question may still be regarded as a\r\nnecessary part of the plan, if it were only to empower the national\r\nlegislature to commit to them the cognizance of causes arising out\r\nof the national Constitution. To confer the power of determining\r\nsuch causes upon the existing courts of the several States, would\r\nperhaps be as much \"to constitute tribunals,\" as to create new\r\ncourts with the like power. But ought not a more direct and\r\nexplicit provision to have been made in favor of the State courts?\r\nThere are, in my opinion, substantial reasons against such a\r\nprovision: the most discerning cannot foresee how far the\r\nprevalency of a local spirit may be found to disqualify the local\r\ntribunals for the jurisdiction of national causes; whilst every man\r\nmay discover, that courts constituted like those of some of the\r\nStates would be improper channels of the judicial authority of the\r\nUnion. State judges, holding their offices during pleasure, or from\r\nyear to year, will be too little independent to be relied upon for\r\nan inflexible execution of the national laws. And if there was a\r\nnecessity for confiding the original cognizance of causes arising\r\nunder those laws to them there would be a correspondent necessity\r\nfor leaving the door of appeal as wide as possible. In proportion\r\nto the grounds of confidence in, or distrust of, the subordinate\r\ntribunals, ought to be the facility or difficulty of appeals. And\r\nwell satisfied as I am of the propriety of the appellate\r\njurisdiction, in the several classes of causes to which it is\r\nextended by the plan of the convention. I should consider every\r\nthing calculated to give, in practice, an UNRESTRAINED COURSE to\r\nappeals, as a source of public and private inconvenience.\r\n\r\nI am not sure, but that it will be found highly expedient and\r\nuseful, to divide the United States into four or five or half a\r\ndozen districts; and to institute a federal court in each district,\r\nin lieu of one in every State. The judges of these courts, with the\r\naid of the State judges, may hold circuits for the trial of causes\r\nin the several parts of the respective districts. Justice through\r\nthem may be administered with ease and despatch; and appeals may be\r\nsafely circumscribed within a narrow compass. This plan appears to\r\nme at present the most eligible of any that could be adopted; and\r\nin order to it, it is necessary that the power of constituting\r\ninferior courts should exist in the full extent in which it is to be\r\nfound in the proposed Constitution.\r\n\r\nThese reasons seem sufficient to satisfy a candid mind, that the\r\nwant of such a power would have been a great defect in the plan.\r\nLet us now examine in what manner the judicial authority is to be\r\ndistributed between the supreme and the inferior courts of the Union.\r\nThe Supreme Court is to be invested with original jurisdiction,\r\nonly \"in cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and\r\nconsuls, and those in which A STATE shall be a party.\" Public\r\nministers of every class are the immediate representatives of their\r\nsovereigns. All questions in which they are concerned are so\r\ndirectly connected with the public peace, that, as well for the\r\npreservation of this, as out of respect to the sovereignties they\r\nrepresent, it is both expedient and proper that such questions\r\nshould be submitted in the first instance to the highest judicatory\r\nof the nation. Though consuls have not in strictness a diplomatic\r\ncharacter, yet as they are the public agents of the nations to which\r\nthey belong, the same observation is in a great measure applicable\r\nto them. In cases in which a State might happen to be a party, it\r\nwould ill suit its dignity to be turned over to an inferior tribunal.\r\nThough it may rather be a digression from the immediate subject\r\nof this paper, I shall take occasion to mention here a supposition\r\nwhich has excited some alarm upon very mistaken grounds. It has\r\nbeen suggested that an assignment of the public securities of one\r\nState to the citizens of another, would enable them to prosecute\r\nthat State in the federal courts for the amount of those securities;\r\na suggestion which the following considerations prove to be without\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nIt is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable\r\nto the suit of an individual WITHOUT ITS CONSENT. This is the\r\ngeneral sense, and the general practice of mankind; and the\r\nexemption, as one of the attributes of sovereignty, is now enjoyed\r\nby the government of every State in the Union. Unless, therefore,\r\nthere is a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention,\r\nit will remain with the States, and the danger intimated must be\r\nmerely ideal. The circumstances which are necessary to produce an\r\nalienation of State sovereignty were discussed in considering the\r\narticle of taxation, and need not be repeated here. A recurrence to\r\nthe principles there established will satisfy us, that there is no\r\ncolor to pretend that the State governments would, by the adoption\r\nof that plan, be divested of the privilege of paying their own debts\r\nin their own way, free from every constraint but that which flows\r\nfrom the obligations of good faith. The contracts between a nation\r\nand individuals are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign,\r\nand have no pretensions to a compulsive force. They confer no right\r\nof action, independent of the sovereign will. To what purpose would\r\nit be to authorize suits against States for the debts they owe? How\r\ncould recoveries be enforced? It is evident, it could not be done\r\nwithout waging war against the contracting State; and to ascribe to\r\nthe federal courts, by mere implication, and in destruction of a\r\npre-existing right of the State governments, a power which would\r\ninvolve such a consequence, would be altogether forced and\r\nunwarrantable.\r\n\r\nLet us resume the train of our observations. We have seen that\r\nthe original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court would be confined to\r\ntwo classes of causes, and those of a nature rarely to occur. In\r\nall other cases of federal cognizance, the original jurisdiction\r\nwould appertain to the inferior tribunals; and the Supreme Court\r\nwould have nothing more than an appellate jurisdiction, \"with such\r\nEXCEPTIONS and under such REGULATIONS as the Congress shall make.\"\r\n\r\nThe propriety of this appellate jurisdiction has been scarcely\r\ncalled in question in regard to matters of law; but the clamors\r\nhave been loud against it as applied to matters of fact. Some\r\nwell-intentioned men in this State, deriving their notions from the\r\nlanguage and forms which obtain in our courts, have been induced to\r\nconsider it as an implied supersedure of the trial by jury, in favor\r\nof the civil-law mode of trial, which prevails in our courts of\r\nadmiralty, probate, and chancery. A technical sense has been\r\naffixed to the term \"appellate,\" which, in our law parlance, is\r\ncommonly used in reference to appeals in the course of the civil law.\r\nBut if I am not misinformed, the same meaning would not be given\r\nto it in any part of New England. There an appeal from one jury to\r\nanother, is familiar both in language and practice, and is even a\r\nmatter of course, until there have been two verdicts on one side.\r\nThe word \"appellate,\" therefore, will not be understood in the\r\nsame sense in New England as in New York, which shows the\r\nimpropriety of a technical interpretation derived from the\r\njurisprudence of any particular State. The expression, taken in the\r\nabstract, denotes nothing more than the power of one tribunal to\r\nreview the proceedings of another, either as to the law or fact, or\r\nboth. The mode of doing it may depend on ancient custom or\r\nlegislative provision (in a new government it must depend on the\r\nlatter), and may be with or without the aid of a jury, as may be\r\njudged advisable. If, therefore, the re-examination of a fact once\r\ndetermined by a jury, should in any case be admitted under the\r\nproposed Constitution, it may be so regulated as to be done by a\r\nsecond jury, either by remanding the cause to the court below for a\r\nsecond trial of the fact, or by directing an issue immediately out\r\nof the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nBut it does not follow that the re-examination of a fact once\r\nascertained by a jury, will be permitted in the Supreme Court. Why\r\nmay not it be said, with the strictest propriety, when a writ of\r\nerror is brought from an inferior to a superior court of law in this\r\nState, that the latter has jurisdiction of the fact as well as the\r\nlaw? It is true it cannot institute a new inquiry concerning the\r\nfact, but it takes cognizance of it as it appears upon the record,\r\nand pronounces the law arising upon it.3 This is jurisdiction\r\nof both fact and law; nor is it even possible to separate them.\r\nThough the common-law courts of this State ascertain disputed facts\r\nby a jury, yet they unquestionably have jurisdiction of both fact\r\nand law; and accordingly when the former is agreed in the\r\npleadings, they have no recourse to a jury, but proceed at once to\r\njudgment. I contend, therefore, on this ground, that the\r\nexpressions, \"appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact,\" do\r\nnot necessarily imply a re-examination in the Supreme Court of facts\r\ndecided by juries in the inferior courts.\r\n\r\nThe following train of ideas may well be imagined to have\r\ninfluenced the convention, in relation to this particular provision.\r\nThe appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court (it may have been\r\nargued) will extend to causes determinable in different modes, some\r\nin the course of the COMMON LAW, others in the course of the CIVIL\r\nLAW. In the former, the revision of the law only will be, generally\r\nspeaking, the proper province of the Supreme Court; in the latter,\r\nthe re-examination of the fact is agreeable to usage, and in some\r\ncases, of which prize causes are an example, might be essential to\r\nthe preservation of the public peace. It is therefore necessary\r\nthat the appellate jurisdiction should, in certain cases, extend in\r\nthe broadest sense to matters of fact. It will not answer to make\r\nan express exception of cases which shall have been originally tried\r\nby a jury, because in the courts of some of the States ALL CAUSES\r\nare tried in this mode4; and such an exception would preclude\r\nthe revision of matters of fact, as well where it might be proper,\r\nas where it might be improper. To avoid all inconveniencies, it\r\nwill be safest to declare generally, that the Supreme Court shall\r\npossess appellate jurisdiction both as to law and FACT, and that\r\nthis jurisdiction shall be subject to such EXCEPTIONS and\r\nregulations as the national legislature may prescribe. This will\r\nenable the government to modify it in such a manner as will best\r\nanswer the ends of public justice and security.\r\n\r\nThis view of the matter, at any rate, puts it out of all doubt\r\nthat the supposed ABOLITION of the trial by jury, by the operation\r\nof this provision, is fallacious and untrue. The legislature of the\r\nUnited States would certainly have full power to provide, that in\r\nappeals to the Supreme Court there should be no re-examination of\r\nfacts where they had been tried in the original causes by juries.\r\nThis would certainly be an authorized exception; but if, for the\r\nreason already intimated, it should be thought too extensive, it\r\nmight be qualified with a limitation to such causes only as are\r\ndeterminable at common law in that mode of trial.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the observations hitherto made on the authority of\r\nthe judicial department is this: that it has been carefully\r\nrestricted to those causes which are manifestly proper for the\r\ncognizance of the national judicature; that in the partition of\r\nthis authority a very small portion of original jurisdiction has\r\nbeen preserved to the Supreme Court, and the rest consigned to the\r\nsubordinate tribunals; that the Supreme Court will possess an\r\nappellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, in all the cases\r\nreferred to them, both subject to any EXCEPTIONS and REGULATIONS\r\nwhich may be thought advisable; that this appellate jurisdiction\r\ndoes, in no case, ABOLISH the trial by jury; and that an ordinary\r\ndegree of prudence and integrity in the national councils will\r\ninsure us solid advantages from the establishment of the proposed\r\njudiciary, without exposing us to any of the inconveniences which\r\nhave been predicted from that source.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n1 Article 3, sec. I.\r\n\r\n2 This power has been absurdly represented as intended to\r\nabolish all the county courts in the several States, which are\r\ncommonly called inferior courts. But the expressions of the\r\nConstitution are, to constitute \"tribunals INFERIOR TO THE SUPREME\r\nCOURT\"; and the evident design of the provision is to enable the\r\ninstitution of local courts, subordinate to the Supreme, either in\r\nStates or larger districts. It is ridiculous to imagine that county\r\ncourts were in contemplation.\r\n\r\n3 This word is composed of JUS and DICTIO, juris dictio or a\r\nspeaking and pronouncing of the law.\r\n\r\n4 I hold that the States will have concurrent jurisdiction with\r\nthe subordinate federal judicatories, in many cases of federal\r\ncognizance, as will be explained in my next paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 82\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Judiciary Continued\r\n\r\nFrom McLEAN's Edition, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTHE erection of a new government, whatever care or wisdom may\r\ndistinguish the work, cannot fail to originate questions of\r\nintricacy and nicety; and these may, in a particular manner, be\r\nexpected to flow from the establishment of a constitution founded\r\nupon the total or partial incorporation of a number of distinct\r\nsovereignties. 'T is time only that can mature and perfect so\r\ncompound a system, can liquidate the meaning of all the parts, and\r\ncan adjust them to each other in a harmonious and consistent WHOLE.\r\n\r\nSuch questions, accordingly, have arisen upon the plan proposed\r\nby the convention, and particularly concerning the judiciary\r\ndepartment. The principal of these respect the situation of the\r\nState courts in regard to those causes which are to be submitted to\r\nfederal jurisdiction. Is this to be exclusive, or are those courts\r\nto possess a concurrent jurisdiction? If the latter, in what\r\nrelation will they stand to the national tribunals? These are\r\ninquiries which we meet with in the mouths of men of sense, and\r\nwhich are certainly entitled to attention.\r\n\r\nThe principles established in a former paper1 teach us that\r\nthe States will retain all PRE-EXISTING authorities which may not be\r\nexclusively delegated to the federal head; and that this exclusive\r\ndelegation can only exist in one of three cases: where an exclusive\r\nauthority is, in express terms, granted to the Union; or where a\r\nparticular authority is granted to the Union, and the exercise of a\r\nlike authority is prohibited to the States; or where an authority\r\nis granted to the Union, with which a similar authority in the\r\nStates would be utterly incompatible. Though these principles may\r\nnot apply with the same force to the judiciary as to the legislative\r\npower, yet I am inclined to think that they are, in the main, just\r\nwith respect to the former, as well as the latter. And under this\r\nimpression, I shall lay it down as a rule, that the State courts\r\nwill RETAIN the jurisdiction they now have, unless it appears to be\r\ntaken away in one of the enumerated modes.\r\n\r\nThe only thing in the proposed Constitution, which wears the\r\nappearance of confining the causes of federal cognizance to the\r\nfederal courts, is contained in this passage:  \"The JUDICIAL POWER\r\nof the United States SHALL BE VESTED in one Supreme Court, and in\r\nSUCH inferior courts as the Congress shall from time to time ordain\r\nand establish.\" This might either be construed to signify, that\r\nthe supreme and subordinate courts of the Union should alone have\r\nthe power of deciding those causes to which their authority is to\r\nextend; or simply to denote, that the organs of the national\r\njudiciary should be one Supreme Court, and as many subordinate\r\ncourts as Congress should think proper to appoint; or in other\r\nwords, that the United States should exercise the judicial power\r\nwith which they are to be invested, through one supreme tribunal,\r\nand a certain number of inferior ones, to be instituted by them.\r\nThe first excludes, the last admits, the concurrent jurisdiction of\r\nthe State tribunals; and as the first would amount to an alienation\r\nof State power by implication, the last appears to me the most\r\nnatural and the most defensible construction.\r\n\r\nBut this doctrine of concurrent jurisdiction is only clearly\r\napplicable to those descriptions of causes of which the State courts\r\nhave previous cognizance. It is not equally evident in relation to\r\ncases which may grow out of, and be PECULIAR to, the Constitution to\r\nbe established; for not to allow the State courts a right of\r\njurisdiction in such cases, can hardly be considered as the\r\nabridgment of a pre-existing authority. I mean not therefore to\r\ncontend that the United States, in the course of legislation upon\r\nthe objects intrusted to their direction, may not commit the\r\ndecision of causes arising upon a particular regulation to the\r\nfederal courts solely, if such a measure should be deemed expedient;\r\nbut I hold that the State courts will be divested of no part of\r\ntheir primitive jurisdiction, further than may relate to an appeal;\r\nand I am even of opinion that in every case in which they were not\r\nexpressly excluded by the future acts of the national legislature,\r\nthey will of course take cognizance of the causes to which those\r\nacts may give birth. This I infer from the nature of judiciary\r\npower, and from the general genius of the system. The judiciary\r\npower of every government looks beyond its own local or municipal\r\nlaws, and in civil cases lays hold of all subjects of litigation\r\nbetween parties within its jurisdiction, though the causes of\r\ndispute are relative to the laws of the most distant part of the\r\nglobe. Those of Japan, not less than of New York, may furnish the\r\nobjects of legal discussion to our courts. When in addition to this\r\nwe consider the State governments and the national governments, as\r\nthey truly are, in the light of kindred systems, and as parts of ONE\r\nWHOLE, the inference seems to be conclusive, that the State courts\r\nwould have a concurrent jurisdiction in all cases arising under the\r\nlaws of the Union, where it was not expressly prohibited.\r\n\r\nHere another question occurs: What relation would subsist\r\nbetween the national and State courts in these instances of\r\nconcurrent jurisdiction? I answer, that an appeal would certainly\r\nlie from the latter, to the Supreme Court of the United States. The\r\nConstitution in direct terms gives an appellate jurisdiction to the\r\nSupreme Court in all the enumerated cases of federal cognizance in\r\nwhich it is not to have an original one, without a single expression\r\nto confine its operation to the inferior federal courts. The\r\nobjects of appeal, not the tribunals from which it is to be made,\r\nare alone contemplated. From this circumstance, and from the reason\r\nof the thing, it ought to be construed to extend to the State\r\ntribunals. Either this must be the case, or the local courts must\r\nbe excluded from a concurrent jurisdiction in matters of national\r\nconcern, else the judiciary authority of the Union may be eluded at\r\nthe pleasure of every plaintiff or prosecutor. Neither of these\r\nconsequences ought, without evident necessity, to be involved; the\r\nlatter would be entirely inadmissible, as it would defeat some of\r\nthe most important and avowed purposes of the proposed government,\r\nand would essentially embarrass its measures. Nor do I perceive any\r\nfoundation for such a supposition. Agreeably to the remark already\r\nmade, the national and State systems are to be regarded as ONE WHOLE.\r\nThe courts of the latter will of course be natural auxiliaries to\r\nthe execution of the laws of the Union, and an appeal from them will\r\nas naturally lie to that tribunal which is destined to unite and\r\nassimilate the principles of national justice and the rules of\r\nnational decisions. The evident aim of the plan of the convention\r\nis, that all the causes of the specified classes shall, for weighty\r\npublic reasons, receive their original or final determination in the\r\ncourts of the Union. To confine, therefore, the general expressions\r\ngiving appellate jurisdiction to the Supreme Court, to appeals from\r\nthe subordinate federal courts, instead of allowing their extension\r\nto the State courts, would be to abridge the latitude of the terms,\r\nin subversion of the intent, contrary to every sound rule of\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\nBut could an appeal be made to lie from the State courts to the\r\nsubordinate federal judicatories? This is another of the questions\r\nwhich have been raised, and of greater difficulty than the former.\r\nThe following considerations countenance the affirmative. The plan\r\nof the convention, in the first place, authorizes the national\r\nlegislature \"to constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme\r\nCourt.\"2 It declares, in the next place, that \"the JUDICIAL\r\nPOWER of the United States SHALL BE VESTED in one Supreme Court, and\r\nin such inferior courts as Congress shall ordain and establish\";\r\nand it then proceeds to enumerate the cases to which this judicial\r\npower shall extend. It afterwards divides the jurisdiction of the\r\nSupreme Court into original and appellate, but gives no definition\r\nof that of the subordinate courts. The only outlines described for\r\nthem, are that they shall be \"inferior to the Supreme Court,\" and\r\nthat they shall not exceed the specified limits of the federal\r\njudiciary. Whether their authority shall be original or appellate,\r\nor both, is not declared. All this seems to be left to the\r\ndiscretion of the legislature. And this being the case, I perceive\r\nat present no impediment to the establishment of an appeal from the\r\nState courts to the subordinate national tribunals; and many\r\nadvantages attending the power of doing it may be imagined. It\r\nwould diminish the motives to the multiplication of federal courts,\r\nand would admit of arrangements calculated to contract the appellate\r\njurisdiction of the Supreme Court. The State tribunals may then be\r\nleft with a more entire charge of federal causes; and appeals, in\r\nmost cases in which they may be deemed proper, instead of being\r\ncarried to the Supreme Court, may be made to lie from the State\r\ncourts to district courts of the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n1 No. 31.\r\n\r\n2 Sec. 8th art. 1st.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 83\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Judiciary Continued in Relation to Trial by Jury\r\n\r\nFrom MCLEAN's Edition, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nTHE objection to the plan of the convention, which has met with\r\nmost success in this State, and perhaps in several of the other\r\nStates, is THAT RELATIVE TO THE WANT OF A CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION\r\nfor the trial by jury in civil cases. The disingenuous form in\r\nwhich this objection is usually stated has been repeatedly adverted\r\nto and exposed, but continues to be pursued in all the conversations\r\nand writings of the opponents of the plan. The mere silence of the\r\nConstitution in regard to CIVIL CAUSES, is represented as an\r\nabolition of the trial by jury, and the declamations to which it has\r\nafforded a pretext are artfully calculated to induce a persuasion\r\nthat this pretended abolition is complete and universal, extending\r\nnot only to every species of civil, but even to CRIMINAL CAUSES. To\r\nargue with respect to the latter would, however, be as vain and\r\nfruitless as to attempt the serious proof of the EXISTENCE of\r\nMATTER, or to demonstrate any of those propositions which, by their\r\nown internal evidence, force conviction, when expressed in language\r\nadapted to convey their meaning.\r\n\r\nWith regard to civil causes, subtleties almost too contemptible\r\nfor refutation have been employed to countenance the surmise that a\r\nthing which is only NOT PROVIDED FOR, is entirely ABOLISHED. Every\r\nman of discernment must at once perceive the wide difference between\r\nSILENCE and ABOLITION. But as the inventors of this fallacy have\r\nattempted to support it by certain LEGAL MAXIMS of interpretation,\r\nwhich they have perverted from their true meaning, it may not be\r\nwholly useless to explore the ground they have taken.\r\n\r\nThe maxims on which they rely are of this nature: \"A\r\nspecification of particulars is an exclusion of generals\"; or,\r\n\"The expression of one thing is the exclusion of another.\" Hence,\r\nsay they, as the Constitution has established the trial by jury in\r\ncriminal cases, and is silent in respect to civil, this silence is\r\nan implied prohibition of trial by jury in regard to the latter.\r\n\r\nThe rules of legal interpretation are rules of COMMONSENSE,\r\nadopted by the courts in the construction of the laws. The true\r\ntest, therefore, of a just application of them is its conformity to\r\nthe source from which they are derived. This being the case, let me\r\nask if it is consistent with common-sense to suppose that a\r\nprovision obliging the legislative power to commit the trial of\r\ncriminal causes to juries, is a privation of its right to authorize\r\nor permit that mode of trial in other cases? Is it natural to\r\nsuppose, that a command to do one thing is a prohibition to the\r\ndoing of another, which there was a previous power to do, and which\r\nis not incompatible with the thing commanded to be done? If such a\r\nsupposition would be unnatural and unreasonable, it cannot be\r\nrational to maintain that an injunction of the trial by jury in\r\ncertain cases is an interdiction of it in others.\r\n\r\nA power to constitute courts is a power to prescribe the mode of\r\ntrial; and consequently, if nothing was said in the Constitution on\r\nthe subject of juries, the legislature would be at liberty either to\r\nadopt that institution or to let it alone. This discretion, in\r\nregard to criminal causes, is abridged by the express injunction of\r\ntrial by jury in all such cases; but it is, of course, left at\r\nlarge in relation to civil causes, there being a total silence on\r\nthis head. The specification of an obligation to try all criminal\r\ncauses in a particular mode, excludes indeed the obligation or\r\nnecessity of employing the same mode in civil causes, but does not\r\nabridge THE POWER of the legislature to exercise that mode if it\r\nshould be thought proper. The pretense, therefore, that the\r\nnational legislature would not be at full liberty to submit all the\r\ncivil causes of federal cognizance to the determination of juries,\r\nis a pretense destitute of all just foundation.\r\n\r\nFrom these observations this conclusion results: that the trial\r\nby jury in civil cases would not be abolished; and that the use\r\nattempted to be made of the maxims which have been quoted, is\r\ncontrary to reason and common-sense, and therefore not admissible.\r\nEven if these maxims had a precise technical sense, corresponding\r\nwith the idea of those who employ them upon the present occasion,\r\nwhich, however, is not the case, they would still be inapplicable to\r\na constitution of government. In relation to such a subject, the\r\nnatural and obvious sense of its provisions, apart from any\r\ntechnical rules, is the true criterion of construction.\r\n\r\nHaving now seen that the maxims relied upon will not bear the\r\nuse made of them, let us endeavor to ascertain their proper use and\r\ntrue meaning. This will be best done by examples. The plan of the\r\nconvention declares that the power of Congress, or, in other words,\r\nof the NATIONAL LEGISLATURE, shall extend to certain enumerated\r\ncases. This specification of particulars evidently excludes all\r\npretension to a general legislative authority, because an\r\naffirmative grant of special powers would be absurd, as well as\r\nuseless, if a general authority was intended.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the judicial authority of the federal judicatures\r\nis declared by the Constitution to comprehend certain cases\r\nparticularly specified. The expression of those cases marks the\r\nprecise limits, beyond which the federal courts cannot extend their\r\njurisdiction, because the objects of their cognizance being\r\nenumerated, the specification would be nugatory if it did not\r\nexclude all ideas of more extensive authority.\r\n\r\nThese examples are sufficient to elucidate the maxims which have\r\nbeen mentioned, and to designate the manner in which they should be\r\nused. But that there may be no misapprehensions upon this subject,\r\nI shall add one case more, to demonstrate the proper use of these\r\nmaxims, and the abuse which has been made of them.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that by the laws of this State a married woman\r\nwas incapable of conveying her estate, and that the legislature,\r\nconsidering this as an evil, should enact that she might dispose of\r\nher property by deed executed in the presence of a magistrate. In\r\nsuch a case there can be no doubt but the specification would amount\r\nto an exclusion of any other mode of conveyance, because the woman\r\nhaving no previous power to alienate her property, the specification\r\ndetermines the particular mode which she is, for that purpose, to\r\navail herself of. But let us further suppose that in a subsequent\r\npart of the same act it should be declared that no woman should\r\ndispose of any estate of a determinate value without the consent of\r\nthree of her nearest relations, signified by their signing the deed;\r\ncould it be inferred from this regulation that a married woman\r\nmight not procure the approbation of her relations to a deed for\r\nconveying property of inferior value? The position is too absurd to\r\nmerit a refutation, and yet this is precisely the position which\r\nthose must establish who contend that the trial by juries in civil\r\ncases is abolished, because it is expressly provided for in cases of\r\na criminal nature.\r\n\r\nFrom these observations it must appear unquestionably true, that\r\ntrial by jury is in no case abolished by the proposed Constitution,\r\nand it is equally true, that in those controversies between\r\nindividuals in which the great body of the people are likely to be\r\ninterested, that institution will remain precisely in the same\r\nsituation in which it is placed by the State constitutions, and will\r\nbe in no degree altered or influenced by the adoption of the plan\r\nunder consideration. The foundation of this assertion is, that the\r\nnational judiciary will have no cognizance of them, and of course\r\nthey will remain determinable as heretofore by the State courts\r\nonly, and in the manner which the State constitutions and laws\r\nprescribe. All land causes, except where claims under the grants of\r\ndifferent States come into question, and all other controversies\r\nbetween the citizens of the same State, unless where they depend\r\nupon positive violations of the articles of union, by acts of the\r\nState legislatures, will belong exclusively to the jurisdiction of\r\nthe State tribunals. Add to this, that admiralty causes, and almost\r\nall those which are of equity jurisdiction, are determinable under\r\nour own government without the intervention of a jury, and the\r\ninference from the whole will be, that this institution, as it\r\nexists with us at present, cannot possibly be affected to any great\r\nextent by the proposed alteration in our system of government.\r\n\r\nThe friends and adversaries of the plan of the convention, if\r\nthey agree in nothing else, concur at least in the value they set\r\nupon the trial by jury; or if there is any difference between them\r\nit consists in this: the former regard it as a valuable safeguard\r\nto liberty; the latter represent it as the very palladium of free\r\ngovernment. For my own part, the more the operation of the\r\ninstitution has fallen under my observation, the more reason I have\r\ndiscovered for holding it in high estimation; and it would be\r\naltogether superfluous to examine to what extent it deserves to be\r\nesteemed useful or essential in a representative republic, or how\r\nmuch more merit it may be entitled to, as a defense against the\r\noppressions of an hereditary monarch, than as a barrier to the\r\ntyranny of popular magistrates in a popular government. Discussions\r\nof this kind would be more curious than beneficial, as all are\r\nsatisfied of the utility of the institution, and of its friendly\r\naspect to liberty. But I must acknowledge that I cannot readily\r\ndiscern the inseparable connection between the existence of liberty,\r\nand the trial by jury in civil cases. Arbitrary impeachments,\r\narbitrary methods of prosecuting pretended offenses, and arbitrary\r\npunishments upon arbitrary convictions, have ever appeared to me to\r\nbe the great engines of judicial despotism; and these have all\r\nrelation to criminal proceedings. The trial by jury in criminal\r\ncases, aided by the habeas-corpus act, seems therefore to be\r\nalone concerned in the question. And both of these are provided\r\nfor, in the most ample manner, in the plan of the convention.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed, that trial by jury is a safeguard against\r\nan oppressive exercise of the power of taxation. This observation\r\ndeserves to be canvassed.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that it can have no influence upon the\r\nlegislature, in regard to the AMOUNT of taxes to be laid, to the\r\nOBJECTS upon which they are to be imposed, or to the RULE by which\r\nthey are to be apportioned. If it can have any influence,\r\ntherefore, it must be upon the mode of collection, and the conduct\r\nof the officers intrusted with the execution of the revenue laws.\r\n\r\nAs to the mode of collection in this State, under our own\r\nConstitution, the trial by jury is in most cases out of use. The\r\ntaxes are usually levied by the more summary proceeding of distress\r\nand sale, as in cases of rent. And it is acknowledged on all hands,\r\nthat this is essential to the efficacy of the revenue laws. The\r\ndilatory course of a trial at law to recover the taxes imposed on\r\nindividuals, would neither suit the exigencies of the public nor\r\npromote the convenience of the citizens. It would often occasion an\r\naccumulation of costs, more burdensome than the original sum of the\r\ntax to be levied.\r\n\r\nAnd as to the conduct of the officers of the revenue, the\r\nprovision in favor of trial by jury in criminal cases, will afford\r\nthe security aimed at. Wilful abuses of a public authority, to the\r\noppression of the subject, and every species of official extortion,\r\nare offenses against the government, for which the persons who\r\ncommit them may be indicted and punished according to the\r\ncircumstances of the case.\r\n\r\nThe excellence of the trial by jury in civil cases appears to\r\ndepend on circumstances foreign to the preservation of liberty. The\r\nstrongest argument in its favor is, that it is a security against\r\ncorruption. As there is always more time and better opportunity to\r\ntamper with a standing body of magistrates than with a jury summoned\r\nfor the occasion, there is room to suppose that a corrupt influence\r\nwould more easily find its way to the former than to the latter.\r\nThe force of this consideration is, however, diminished by others.\r\nThe sheriff, who is the summoner of ordinary juries, and the clerks\r\nof courts, who have the nomination of special juries, are themselves\r\nstanding officers, and, acting individually, may be supposed more\r\naccessible to the touch of corruption than the judges, who are a\r\ncollective body. It is not difficult to see, that it would be in\r\nthe power of those officers to select jurors who would serve the\r\npurpose of the party as well as a corrupted bench. In the next\r\nplace, it may fairly be supposed, that there would be less\r\ndifficulty in gaining some of the jurors promiscuously taken from\r\nthe public mass, than in gaining men who had been chosen by the\r\ngovernment for their probity and good character. But making every\r\ndeduction for these considerations, the trial by jury must still be\r\na valuable check upon corruption. It greatly multiplies the\r\nimpediments to its success. As matters now stand, it would be\r\nnecessary to corrupt both court and jury; for where the jury have\r\ngone evidently wrong, the court will generally grant a new trial,\r\nand it would be in most cases of little use to practice upon the\r\njury, unless the court could be likewise gained. Here then is a\r\ndouble security; and it will readily be perceived that this\r\ncomplicated agency tends to preserve the purity of both institutions.\r\nBy increasing the obstacles to success, it discourages attempts to\r\nseduce the integrity of either. The temptations to prostitution\r\nwhich the judges might have to surmount, must certainly be much\r\nfewer, while the co-operation of a jury is necessary, than they\r\nmight be, if they had themselves the exclusive determination of all\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, therefore, the doubts I have expressed, as to\r\nthe essentiality of trial by jury in civil cases to liberty, I admit\r\nthat it is in most cases, under proper regulations, an excellent\r\nmethod of determining questions of property; and that on this\r\naccount alone it would be entitled to a constitutional provision in\r\nits favor if it were possible to fix the limits within which it\r\nought to be comprehended. There is, however, in all cases, great\r\ndifficulty in this; and men not blinded by enthusiasm must be\r\nsensible that in a federal government, which is a composition of\r\nsocieties whose ideas and institutions in relation to the matter\r\nmaterially vary from each other, that difficulty must be not a\r\nlittle augmented. For my own part, at every new view I take of the\r\nsubject, I become more convinced of the reality of the obstacles\r\nwhich, we are authoritatively informed, prevented the insertion of a\r\nprovision on this head in the plan of the convention.\r\n\r\nThe great difference between the limits of the jury trial in\r\ndifferent States is not generally understood; and as it must have\r\nconsiderable influence on the sentence we ought to pass upon the\r\nomission complained of in regard to this point, an explanation of it\r\nis necessary. In this State, our judicial establishments resemble,\r\nmore nearly than in any other, those of Great Britain. We have\r\ncourts of common law, courts of probates (analogous in certain\r\nmatters to the spiritual courts in England), a court of admiralty\r\nand a court of chancery. In the courts of common law only, the\r\ntrial by jury prevails, and this with some exceptions. In all the\r\nothers a single judge presides, and proceeds in general either\r\naccording to the course of the canon or civil law, without the aid\r\nof a jury.1 In New Jersey, there is a court of chancery which\r\nproceeds like ours, but neither courts of admiralty nor of probates,\r\nin the sense in which these last are established with us. In that\r\nState the courts of common law have the cognizance of those causes\r\nwhich with us are determinable in the courts of admiralty and of\r\nprobates, and of course the jury trial is more extensive in New\r\nJersey than in New York. In Pennsylvania, this is perhaps still\r\nmore the case, for there is no court of chancery in that State, and\r\nits common-law courts have equity jurisdiction. It has a court of\r\nadmiralty, but none of probates, at least on the plan of ours.\r\nDelaware has in these respects imitated Pennsylvania. Maryland\r\napproaches more nearly to New York, as does also Virginia, except\r\nthat the latter has a plurality of chancellors. North Carolina\r\nbears most affinity to Pennsylvania; South Carolina to Virginia. I\r\nbelieve, however, that in some of those States which have distinct\r\ncourts of admiralty, the causes depending in them are triable by\r\njuries. In Georgia there are none but common-law courts, and an\r\nappeal of course lies from the verdict of one jury to another, which\r\nis called a special jury, and for which a particular mode of\r\nappointment is marked out. In Connecticut, they have no distinct\r\ncourts either of chancery or of admiralty, and their courts of\r\nprobates have no jurisdiction of causes. Their common-law courts\r\nhave admiralty and, to a certain extent, equity jurisdiction. In\r\ncases of importance, their General Assembly is the only court of\r\nchancery. In Connecticut, therefore, the trial by jury extends in\r\nPRACTICE further than in any other State yet mentioned. Rhode\r\nIsland is, I believe, in this particular, pretty much in the\r\nsituation of Connecticut. Massachusetts and New Hampshire, in\r\nregard to the blending of law, equity, and admiralty jurisdictions,\r\nare in a similar predicament. In the four Eastern States, the trial\r\nby jury not only stands upon a broader foundation than in the other\r\nStates, but it is attended with a peculiarity unknown, in its full\r\nextent, to any of them. There is an appeal OF COURSE from one jury\r\nto another, till there have been two verdicts out of three on one\r\nside.\r\n\r\nFrom this sketch it appears that there is a material diversity,\r\nas well in the modification as in the extent of the institution of\r\ntrial by jury in civil cases, in the several States; and from this\r\nfact these obvious reflections flow: first, that no general rule\r\ncould have been fixed upon by the convention which would have\r\ncorresponded with the circumstances of all the States; and\r\nsecondly, that more or at least as much might have been hazarded by\r\ntaking the system of any one State for a standard, as by omitting a\r\nprovision altogether and leaving the matter, as has been done, to\r\nlegislative regulation.\r\n\r\nThe propositions which have been made for supplying the omission\r\nhave rather served to illustrate than to obviate the difficulty of\r\nthe thing. The minority of Pennsylvania have proposed this mode of\r\nexpression for the purpose \"Trial by jury shall be as\r\nheretofore\" and this I maintain would be senseless and nugatory.\r\nThe United States, in their united or collective capacity, are the\r\nOBJECT to which all general provisions in the Constitution must\r\nnecessarily be construed to refer. Now it is evident that though\r\ntrial by jury, with various limitations, is known in each State\r\nindividually, yet in the United States, AS SUCH, it is at this time\r\naltogether unknown, because the present federal government has no\r\njudiciary power whatever; and consequently there is no proper\r\nantecedent or previous establishment to which the term HERETOFORE\r\ncould relate. It would therefore be destitute of a precise meaning,\r\nand inoperative from its uncertainty.\r\n\r\nAs, on the one hand, the form of the provision would not fulfil\r\nthe intent of its proposers, so, on the other, if I apprehend that\r\nintent rightly, it would be in itself inexpedient. I presume it to\r\nbe, that causes in the federal courts should be tried by jury, if,\r\nin the State where the courts sat, that mode of trial would obtain\r\nin a similar case in the State courts; that is to say, admiralty\r\ncauses should be tried in Connecticut by a jury, in New York without\r\none. The capricious operation of so dissimilar a method of trial in\r\nthe same cases, under the same government, is of itself sufficient\r\nto indispose every wellregulated judgment towards it. Whether the\r\ncause should be tried with or without a jury, would depend, in a\r\ngreat number of cases, on the accidental situation of the court and\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nBut this is not, in my estimation, the greatest objection. I\r\nfeel a deep and deliberate conviction that there are many cases in\r\nwhich the trial by jury is an ineligible one. I think it so\r\nparticularly in cases which concern the public peace with foreign\r\nnations that is, in most cases where the question turns wholly on\r\nthe laws of nations. Of this nature, among others, are all prize\r\ncauses. Juries cannot be supposed competent to investigations that\r\nrequire a thorough knowledge of the laws and usages of nations; and\r\nthey will sometimes be under the influence of impressions which will\r\nnot suffer them to pay sufficient regard to those considerations of\r\npublic policy which ought to guide their inquiries. There would of\r\ncourse be always danger that the rights of other nations might be\r\ninfringed by their decisions, so as to afford occasions of reprisal\r\nand war. Though the proper province of juries be to determine\r\nmatters of fact, yet in most cases legal consequences are\r\ncomplicated with fact in such a manner as to render a separation\r\nimpracticable.\r\n\r\nIt will add great weight to this remark, in relation to prize\r\ncauses, to mention that the method of determining them has been\r\nthought worthy of particular regulation in various treaties between\r\ndifferent powers of Europe, and that, pursuant to such treaties,\r\nthey are determinable in Great Britain, in the last resort, before\r\nthe king himself, in his privy council, where the fact, as well as\r\nthe law, undergoes a re-examination. This alone demonstrates the\r\nimpolicy of inserting a fundamental provision in the Constitution\r\nwhich would make the State systems a standard for the national\r\ngovernment in the article under consideration, and the danger of\r\nencumbering the government with any constitutional provisions the\r\npropriety of which is not indisputable.\r\n\r\nMy convictions are equally strong that great advantages result\r\nfrom the separation of the equity from the law jurisdiction, and\r\nthat the causes which belong to the former would be improperly\r\ncommitted to juries. The great and primary use of a court of equity\r\nis to give relief IN EXTRAORDINARY CASES, which are EXCEPTIONS2\r\nto general rules. To unite the jurisdiction of such cases with the\r\nordinary jurisdiction, must have a tendency to unsettle the general\r\nrules, and to subject every case that arises to a SPECIAL\r\ndetermination; while a separation of the one from the other has the\r\ncontrary effect of rendering one a sentinel over the other, and of\r\nkeeping each within the expedient limits. Besides this, the\r\ncircumstances that constitute cases proper for courts of equity are\r\nin many instances so nice and intricate, that they are incompatible\r\nwith the genius of trials by jury. They require often such long,\r\ndeliberate, and critical investigation as would be impracticable to\r\nmen called from their occupations, and obliged to decide before they\r\nwere permitted to return to them. The simplicity and expedition\r\nwhich form the distinguishing characters of this mode of trial\r\nrequire that the matter to be decided should be reduced to some\r\nsingle and obvious point; while the litigations usual in chancery\r\nfrequently comprehend a long train of minute and independent\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the separation of the equity from the legal\r\njurisdiction is peculiar to the English system of jurisprudence:\r\nwhich is the model that has been followed in several of the States.\r\nBut it is equally true that the trial by jury has been unknown in\r\nevery case in which they have been united. And the separation is\r\nessential to the preservation of that institution in its pristine\r\npurity. The nature of a court of equity will readily permit the\r\nextension of its jurisdiction to matters of law; but it is not a\r\nlittle to be suspected, that the attempt to extend the jurisdiction\r\nof the courts of law to matters of equity will not only be\r\nunproductive of the advantages which may be derived from courts of\r\nchancery, on the plan upon which they are established in this State,\r\nbut will tend gradually to change the nature of the courts of law,\r\nand to undermine the trial by jury, by introducing questions too\r\ncomplicated for a decision in that mode.\r\n\r\nThese appeared to be conclusive reasons against incorporating\r\nthe systems of all the States, in the formation of the national\r\njudiciary, according to what may be conjectured to have been the\r\nattempt of the Pennsylvania minority. Let us now examine how far\r\nthe proposition of Massachusetts is calculated to remedy the\r\nsupposed defect.\r\n\r\nIt is in this form: \"In civil actions between citizens of\r\ndifferent States, every issue of fact, arising in ACTIONS AT COMMON\r\nLAW, may be tried by a jury if the parties, or either of them\r\nrequest it.\"\r\n\r\nThis, at best, is a proposition confined to one description of\r\ncauses; and the inference is fair, either that the Massachusetts\r\nconvention considered that as the only class of federal causes, in\r\nwhich the trial by jury would be proper; or that if desirous of a\r\nmore extensive provision, they found it impracticable to devise one\r\nwhich would properly answer the end. If the first, the omission of\r\na regulation respecting so partial an object can never be considered\r\nas a material imperfection in the system. If the last, it affords a\r\nstrong corroboration of the extreme difficulty of the thing.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all: if we advert to the observations already\r\nmade respecting the courts that subsist in the several States of the\r\nUnion, and the different powers exercised by them, it will appear\r\nthat there are no expressions more vague and indeterminate than\r\nthose which have been employed to characterize THAT species of\r\ncauses which it is intended shall be entitled to a trial by jury.\r\nIn this State, the boundaries between actions at common law and\r\nactions of equitable jurisdiction, are ascertained in conformity to\r\nthe rules which prevail in England upon that subject. In many of\r\nthe other States the boundaries are less precise. In some of them\r\nevery cause is to be tried in a court of common law, and upon that\r\nfoundation every action may be considered as an action at common\r\nlaw, to be determined by a jury, if the parties, or either of them,\r\nchoose it. Hence the same irregularity and confusion would be\r\nintroduced by a compliance with this proposition, that I have\r\nalready noticed as resulting from the regulation proposed by the\r\nPennsylvania minority. In one State a cause would receive its\r\ndetermination from a jury, if the parties, or either of them,\r\nrequested it; but in another State, a cause exactly similar to the\r\nother, must be decided without the intervention of a jury, because\r\nthe State judicatories varied as to common-law jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, therefore, that the Massachusetts proposition,\r\nupon this subject cannot operate as a general regulation, until some\r\nuniform plan, with respect to the limits of common-law and equitable\r\njurisdictions, shall be adopted by the different States. To devise\r\na plan of that kind is a task arduous in itself, and which it would\r\nrequire much time and reflection to mature. It would be extremely\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, to suggest any general regulation that\r\nwould be acceptable to all the States in the Union, or that would\r\nperfectly quadrate with the several State institutions.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, Why could not a reference have been made to the\r\nconstitution of this State, taking that, which is allowed by me to\r\nbe a good one, as a standard for the United States? I answer that\r\nit is not very probable the other States would entertain the same\r\nopinion of our institutions as we do ourselves. It is natural to\r\nsuppose that they are hitherto more attached to their own, and that\r\neach would struggle for the preference. If the plan of taking one\r\nState as a model for the whole had been thought of in the\r\nconvention, it is to be presumed that the adoption of it in that\r\nbody would have been rendered difficult by the predilection of each\r\nrepresentation in favor of its own government; and it must be\r\nuncertain which of the States would have been taken as the model.\r\nIt has been shown that many of them would be improper ones. And I\r\nleave it to conjecture, whether, under all circumstances, it is most\r\nlikely that New York, or some other State, would have been preferred.\r\nBut admit that a judicious selection could have been effected in\r\nthe convention, still there would have been great danger of jealousy\r\nand disgust in the other States, at the partiality which had been\r\nshown to the institutions of one. The enemies of the plan would\r\nhave been furnished with a fine pretext for raising a host of local\r\nprejudices against it, which perhaps might have hazarded, in no\r\ninconsiderable degree, its final establishment.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the embarrassments of a definition of the cases which\r\nthe trial by jury ought to embrace, it is sometimes suggested by men\r\nof enthusiastic tempers, that a provision might have been inserted\r\nfor establishing it in all cases whatsoever. For this I believe, no\r\nprecedent is to be found in any member of the Union; and the\r\nconsiderations which have been stated in discussing the proposition\r\nof the minority of Pennsylvania, must satisfy every sober mind that\r\nthe establishment of the trial by jury in ALL cases would have been\r\nan unpardonable error in the plan.\r\n\r\nIn short, the more it is considered the more arduous will appear\r\nthe task of fashioning a provision in such a form as not to express\r\ntoo little to answer the purpose, or too much to be advisable; or\r\nwhich might not have opened other sources of opposition to the great\r\nand essential object of introducing a firm national government.\r\n\r\nI cannot but persuade myself, on the other hand, that the\r\ndifferent lights in which the subject has been placed in the course\r\nof these observations, will go far towards removing in candid minds\r\nthe apprehensions they may have entertained on the point. They have\r\ntended to show that the security of liberty is materially concerned\r\nonly in the trial by jury in criminal cases, which is provided for\r\nin the most ample manner in the plan of the convention; that even\r\nin far the greatest proportion of civil cases, and those in which\r\nthe great body of the community is interested, that mode of trial\r\nwill remain in its full force, as established in the State\r\nconstitutions, untouched and unaffected by the plan of the\r\nconvention; that it is in no case abolished3 by that plan; and\r\nthat there are great if not insurmountable difficulties in the way\r\nof making any precise and proper provision for it in a Constitution\r\nfor the United States.\r\n\r\nThe best judges of the matter will be the least anxious for a\r\nconstitutional establishment of the trial by jury in civil cases,\r\nand will be the most ready to admit that the changes which are\r\ncontinually happening in the affairs of society may render a\r\ndifferent mode of determining questions of property preferable in\r\nmany cases in which that mode of trial now prevails. For my part, I\r\nacknowledge myself to be convinced that even in this State it might\r\nbe advantageously extended to some cases to which it does not at\r\npresent apply, and might as advantageously be abridged in others.\r\nIt is conceded by all reasonable men that it ought not to obtain in\r\nall cases. The examples of innovations which contract its ancient\r\nlimits, as well in these States as in Great Britain, afford a strong\r\npresumption that its former extent has been found inconvenient, and\r\ngive room to suppose that future experience may discover the\r\npropriety and utility of other exceptions. I suspect it to be\r\nimpossible in the nature of the thing to fix the salutary point at\r\nwhich the operation of the institution ought to stop, and this is\r\nwith me a strong argument for leaving the matter to the discretion\r\nof the legislature.\r\n\r\nThis is now clearly understood to be the case in Great Britain,\r\nand it is equally so in the State of Connecticut; and yet it may be\r\nsafely affirmed that more numerous encroachments have been made upon\r\nthe trial by jury in this State since the Revolution, though\r\nprovided for by a positive article of our constitution, than has\r\nhappened in the same time either in Connecticut or Great Britain.\r\nIt may be added that these encroachments have generally originated\r\nwith the men who endeavor to persuade the people they are the\r\nwarmest defenders of popular liberty, but who have rarely suffered\r\nconstitutional obstacles to arrest them in a favorite career. The\r\ntruth is that the general GENIUS of a government is all that can be\r\nsubstantially relied upon for permanent effects. Particular\r\nprovisions, though not altogether useless, have far less virtue and\r\nefficacy than are commonly ascribed to them; and the want of them\r\nwill never be, with men of sound discernment, a decisive objection\r\nto any plan which exhibits the leading characters of a good\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIt certainly sounds not a little harsh and extraordinary to\r\naffirm that there is no security for liberty in a Constitution which\r\nexpressly establishes the trial by jury in criminal cases, because\r\nit does not do it in civil also; while it is a notorious fact that\r\nConnecticut, which has been always regarded as the most popular\r\nState in the Union, can boast of no constitutional provision for\r\neither.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n1 It has been erroneously insinuated, with regard to the court\r\nof chancery, that this court generally tries disputed facts by a\r\njury. The truth is, that references to a jury in that court rarely\r\nhappen, and are in no case necessary but where the validity of a\r\ndevise of land comes into question.\r\n\r\n2 It is true that the principles by which that relief is\r\ngoverned are now reduced to a regular system; but it is not the\r\nless true that they are in the main applicable to SPECIAL\r\ncircumstances, which form exceptions to general rules.\r\n\r\n3 Vide No. 81, in which the supposition of its being\r\nabolished by the appellate jurisdiction in matters of fact being\r\nvested in the Supreme Court, is examined and refuted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 84\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCertain General and Miscellaneous Objections to the Constitution\r\nConsidered and Answered\r\n\r\nFrom McLEAN's Edition, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nIN THE course of the foregoing review of the Constitution, I\r\nhave taken notice of, and endeavored to answer most of the\r\nobjections which have appeared against it. There, however, remain a\r\nfew which either did not fall naturally under any particular head or\r\nwere forgotten in their proper places. These shall now be\r\ndiscussed; but as the subject has been drawn into great length, I\r\nshall so far consult brevity as to comprise all my observations on\r\nthese miscellaneous points in a single paper.\r\n\r\nThe most considerable of the remaining objections is that the\r\nplan of the convention contains no bill of rights. Among other\r\nanswers given to this, it has been upon different occasions remarked\r\nthat the constitutions of several of the States are in a similar\r\npredicament. I add that New York is of the number. And yet the\r\nopposers of the new system, in this State, who profess an unlimited\r\nadmiration for its constitution, are among the most intemperate\r\npartisans of a bill of rights. To justify their zeal in this\r\nmatter, they allege two things: one is that, though the\r\nconstitution of New York has no bill of rights prefixed to it, yet\r\nit contains, in the body of it, various provisions in favor of\r\nparticular privileges and rights, which, in substance amount to the\r\nsame thing; the other is, that the Constitution adopts, in their\r\nfull extent, the common and statute law of Great Britain, by which\r\nmany other rights, not expressed in it, are equally secured.\r\n\r\nTo the first I answer, that the Constitution proposed by the\r\nconvention contains, as well as the constitution of this State, a\r\nnumber of such provisions.\r\n\r\nIndependent of those which relate to the structure of the\r\ngovernment, we find the following: Article 1, section 3, clause 7\r\n\"Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to\r\nremoval from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any\r\noffice of honor, trust, or profit under the United States; but the\r\nparty convicted shall, nevertheless, be liable and subject to\r\nindictment, trial, judgment, and punishment according to law.\"\r\nSection 9, of the same article, clause 2 \"The privilege of the\r\nwrit of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in\r\ncases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.\"\r\nClause 3 \"No bill of attainder or ex-post-facto law shall be\r\npassed.\" Clause 7 \"No title of nobility shall be granted by the\r\nUnited States; and no person holding any office of profit or trust\r\nunder them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of\r\nany present, emolument, office, or title of any kind whatever, from\r\nany king, prince, or foreign state.\" Article 3, section 2, clause\r\n3 \"The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall\r\nbe by jury; and such trial shall be held in the State where the\r\nsaid crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed\r\nwithin any State, the trial shall be at such place or places as the\r\nCongress may by law have directed.\" Section 3, of the same\r\narticle \"Treason against the United States shall consist only in\r\nlevying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving\r\nthem aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason,\r\nunless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or\r\non confession in open court.\" And clause 3, of the same\r\nsection \"The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of\r\ntreason; but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of\r\nblood, or forfeiture, except during the life of the person attainted.\"\r\nIt may well be a question, whether these are not, upon the\r\nwhole, of equal importance with any which are to be found in the\r\nconstitution of this State. The establishment of the writ of\r\nhabeas corpus, the prohibition of ex-post-facto laws, and of\r\nTITLES OF NOBILITY, TO WHICH WE HAVE NO CORRESPONDING PROVISION IN\r\nOUR CONSTITUTION, are perhaps greater securities to liberty and\r\nrepublicanism than any it contains. The creation of crimes after\r\nthe commission of the fact, or, in other words, the subjecting of\r\nmen to punishment for things which, when they were done, were\r\nbreaches of no law, and the practice of arbitrary imprisonments,\r\nhave been, in all ages, the favorite and most formidable instruments\r\nof tyranny. The observations of the judicious Blackstone,1 in\r\nreference to the latter, are well worthy of recital: \"To bereave a\r\nman of life, Usays he,e or by violence to confiscate his estate,\r\nwithout accusation or trial, would be so gross and notorious an act\r\nof despotism, as must at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout\r\nthe whole nation; but confinement of the person, by secretly\r\nhurrying him to jail, where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten,\r\nis a less public, a less striking, and therefore A MORE DANGEROUS\r\nENGINE of arbitrary government.\" And as a remedy for this fatal\r\nevil he is everywhere peculiarly emphatical in his encomiums on the\r\nhabeas-corpus act, which in one place he calls \"the BULWARK of\r\nthe British Constitution.\"2\r\n\r\nNothing need be said to illustrate the importance of the\r\nprohibition of titles of nobility. This may truly be denominated\r\nthe corner-stone of republican government; for so long as they are\r\nexcluded, there can never be serious danger that the government will\r\nbe any other than that of the people.\r\n\r\nTo the second that is, to the pretended establishment of the\r\ncommon and state law by the Constitution, I answer, that they are\r\nexpressly made subject \"to such alterations and provisions as the\r\nlegislature shall from time to time make concerning the same.\"\r\nThey are therefore at any moment liable to repeal by the ordinary\r\nlegislative power, and of course have no constitutional sanction.\r\nThe only use of the declaration was to recognize the ancient law\r\nand to remove doubts which might have been occasioned by the\r\nRevolution. This consequently can be considered as no part of a\r\ndeclaration of rights, which under our constitutions must be\r\nintended as limitations of the power of the government itself.\r\n\r\nIt has been several times truly remarked that bills of rights\r\nare, in their origin, stipulations between kings and their subjects,\r\nabridgements of prerogative in favor of privilege, reservations of\r\nrights not surrendered to the prince. Such was MAGNA CHARTA,\r\nobtained by the barons, sword in hand, from King John. Such were\r\nthe subsequent confirmations of that charter by succeeding princes.\r\nSuch was the PETITION OF RIGHT assented to by Charles I., in the\r\nbeginning of his reign. Such, also, was the Declaration of Right\r\npresented by the Lords and Commons to the Prince of Orange in 1688,\r\nand afterwards thrown into the form of an act of parliament called\r\nthe Bill of Rights. It is evident, therefore, that, according to\r\ntheir primitive signification, they have no application to\r\nconstitutions professedly founded upon the power of the people, and\r\nexecuted by their immediate representatives and servants. Here, in\r\nstrictness, the people surrender nothing; and as they retain every\r\nthing they have no need of particular reservations. \"WE, THE\r\nPEOPLE of the United States, to secure the blessings of liberty to\r\nourselves and our posterity, do ORDAIN and ESTABLISH this\r\nConstitution for the United States of America.\" Here is a better\r\nrecognition of popular rights, than volumes of those aphorisms which\r\nmake the principal figure in several of our State bills of rights,\r\nand which would sound much better in a treatise of ethics than in a\r\nconstitution of government.\r\n\r\nBut a minute detail of particular rights is certainly far less\r\napplicable to a Constitution like that under consideration, which is\r\nmerely intended to regulate the general political interests of the\r\nnation, than to a constitution which has the regulation of every\r\nspecies of personal and private concerns. If, therefore, the loud\r\nclamors against the plan of the convention, on this score, are well\r\nfounded, no epithets of reprobation will be too strong for the\r\nconstitution of this State. But the truth is, that both of them\r\ncontain all which, in relation to their objects, is reasonably to be\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nI go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and\r\nto the extent in which they are contended for, are not only\r\nunnecessary in the proposed Constitution, but would even be\r\ndangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers not\r\ngranted; and, on this very account, would afford a colorable\r\npretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that\r\nthings shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why, for\r\ninstance, should it be said that the liberty of the press shall not\r\nbe restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be\r\nimposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a\r\nregulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men\r\ndisposed to usurp, a plausible pretense for claiming that power.\r\nThey might urge with a semblance of reason, that the Constitution\r\nought not to be charged with the absurdity of providing against the\r\nabuse of an authority which was not given, and that the provision\r\nagainst restraining the liberty of the press afforded a clear\r\nimplication, that a power to prescribe proper regulations concerning\r\nit was intended to be vested in the national government. This may\r\nserve as a specimen of the numerous handles which would be given to\r\nthe doctrine of constructive powers, by the indulgence of an\r\ninjudicious zeal for bills of rights.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the liberty of the press, as much as has been\r\nsaid, I cannot forbear adding a remark or two: in the first place,\r\nI observe, that there is not a syllable concerning it in the\r\nconstitution of this State; in the next, I contend, that whatever\r\nhas been said about it in that of any other State, amounts to\r\nnothing. What signifies a declaration, that \"the liberty of the\r\npress shall be inviolably preserved\"? What is the liberty of the\r\npress? Who can give it any definition which would not leave the\r\nutmost latitude for evasion? I hold it to be impracticable; and\r\nfrom this I infer, that its security, whatever fine declarations may\r\nbe inserted in any constitution respecting it, must altogether\r\ndepend on public opinion, and on the general spirit of the people\r\nand of the government.3 And here, after all, as is intimated\r\nupon another occasion, must we seek for the only solid basis of all\r\nour rights.\r\n\r\nThere remains but one other view of this matter to conclude the\r\npoint. The truth is, after all the declamations we have heard, that\r\nthe Constitution is itself, in every rational sense, and to every\r\nuseful purpose, A BILL OF RIGHTS. The several bills of rights in\r\nGreat Britain form its Constitution, and conversely the constitution\r\nof each State is its bill of rights. And the proposed Constitution,\r\nif adopted, will be the bill of rights of the Union. Is it one\r\nobject of a bill of rights to declare and specify the political\r\nprivileges of the citizens in the structure and administration of\r\nthe government? This is done in the most ample and precise manner\r\nin the plan of the convention; comprehending various precautions\r\nfor the public security, which are not to be found in any of the\r\nState constitutions. Is another object of a bill of rights to\r\ndefine certain immunities and modes of proceeding, which are\r\nrelative to personal and private concerns? This we have seen has\r\nalso been attended to, in a variety of cases, in the same plan.\r\nAdverting therefore to the substantial meaning of a bill of rights,\r\nit is absurd to allege that it is not to be found in the work of the\r\nconvention. It may be said that it does not go far enough, though\r\nit will not be easy to make this appear; but it can with no\r\npropriety be contended that there is no such thing. It certainly\r\nmust be immaterial what mode is observed as to the order of\r\ndeclaring the rights of the citizens, if they are to be found in any\r\npart of the instrument which establishes the government. And hence\r\nit must be apparent, that much of what has been said on this subject\r\nrests merely on verbal and nominal distinctions, entirely foreign\r\nfrom the substance of the thing.\r\n\r\nAnother objection which has been made, and which, from the\r\nfrequency of its repetition, it is to be presumed is relied on, is\r\nof this nature: \"It is improper,\" say the objectors, \"to confer such\r\nlarge powers, as are proposed, upon the national government, because\r\nthe seat of that government must of necessity be too remote from\r\nmany of the States to admit of a proper knowledge on the part of the\r\nconstituent, of the conduct of the representative body.\" This\r\nargument, if it proves any thing, proves that there ought to be no\r\ngeneral government whatever. For the powers which, it seems to be\r\nagreed on all hands, ought to be vested in the Union, cannot be\r\nsafely intrusted to a body which is not under every requisite\r\ncontrol. But there are satisfactory reasons to show that the\r\nobjection is in reality not well founded. There is in most of the\r\narguments which relate to distance a palpable illusion of the\r\nimagination. What are the sources of information by which the\r\npeople in Montgomery County must regulate their judgment of the\r\nconduct of their representatives in the State legislature? Of\r\npersonal observation they can have no benefit. This is confined to\r\nthe citizens on the spot. They must therefore depend on the\r\ninformation of intelligent men, in whom they confide; and how must\r\nthese men obtain their information? Evidently from the complexion\r\nof public measures, from the public prints, from correspondences\r\nwith their representatives, and with other persons who reside at the\r\nplace of their deliberations. This does not apply to Montgomery\r\nCounty only, but to all the counties at any considerable distance\r\nfrom the seat of government.\r\n\r\nIt is equally evident that the same sources of information would\r\nbe open to the people in relation to the conduct of their\r\nrepresentatives in the general government, and the impediments to a\r\nprompt communication which distance may be supposed to create, will\r\nbe overbalanced by the effects of the vigilance of the State\r\ngovernments. The executive and legislative bodies of each State\r\nwill be so many sentinels over the persons employed in every\r\ndepartment of the national administration; and as it will be in\r\ntheir power to adopt and pursue a regular and effectual system of\r\nintelligence, they can never be at a loss to know the behavior of\r\nthose who represent their constituents in the national councils, and\r\ncan readily communicate the same knowledge to the people. Their\r\ndisposition to apprise the community of whatever may prejudice its\r\ninterests from another quarter, may be relied upon, if it were only\r\nfrom the rivalship of power. And we may conclude with the fullest\r\nassurance that the people, through that channel, will be better\r\ninformed of the conduct of their national representatives, than they\r\ncan be by any means they now possess of that of their State\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\nIt ought also to be remembered that the citizens who inhabit the\r\ncountry at and near the seat of government will, in all questions\r\nthat affect the general liberty and prosperity, have the same\r\ninterest with those who are at a distance, and that they will stand\r\nready to sound the alarm when necessary, and to point out the actors\r\nin any pernicious project. The public papers will be expeditious\r\nmessengers of intelligence to the most remote inhabitants of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nAmong the many curious objections which have appeared against\r\nthe proposed Constitution, the most extraordinary and the least\r\ncolorable is derived from the want of some provision respecting the\r\ndebts due TO the United States. This has been represented as a\r\ntacit relinquishment of those debts, and as a wicked contrivance to\r\nscreen public defaulters. The newspapers have teemed with the most\r\ninflammatory railings on this head; yet there is nothing clearer\r\nthan that the suggestion is entirely void of foundation, the\r\noffspring of extreme ignorance or extreme dishonesty. In addition\r\nto the remarks I have made upon the subject in another place, I\r\nshall only observe that as it is a plain dictate of common-sense, so\r\nit is also an established doctrine of political law, that \"STATES\r\nNEITHER LOSE ANY OF THEIR RIGHTS, NOR ARE DISCHARGED FROM ANY OF\r\nTHEIR OBLIGATIONS, BY A CHANGE IN THE FORM OF THEIR CIVIL GOVERNMENT.\"4\r\nThe last objection of any consequence, which I at present\r\nrecollect, turns upon the article of expense. If it were even true,\r\nthat the adoption of the proposed government would occasion a\r\nconsiderable increase of expense, it would be an objection that\r\nought to have no weight against the plan.\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of the citizens of America are with reason\r\nconvinced, that Union is the basis of their political happiness.\r\nMen of sense of all parties now, with few exceptions, agree that it\r\ncannot be preserved under the present system, nor without radical\r\nalterations; that new and extensive powers ought to be granted to\r\nthe national head, and that these require a different organization\r\nof the federal government a single body being an unsafe depositary\r\nof such ample authorities. In conceding all this, the question of\r\nexpense must be given up; for it is impossible, with any degree of\r\nsafety, to narrow the foundation upon which the system is to stand.\r\nThe two branches of the legislature are, in the first instance, to\r\nconsist of only sixty-five persons, which is the same number of\r\nwhich Congress, under the existing Confederation, may be composed.\r\nIt is true that this number is intended to be increased; but this\r\nis to keep pace with the progress of the population and resources of\r\nthe country. It is evident that a less number would, even in the\r\nfirst instance, have been unsafe, and that a continuance of the\r\npresent number would, in a more advanced stage of population, be a\r\nvery inadequate representation of the people.\r\n\r\nWhence is the dreaded augmentation of expense to spring? One\r\nsource indicated, is the multiplication of offices under the new\r\ngovernment. Let us examine this a little.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the principal departments of the\r\nadministration under the present government, are the same which will\r\nbe required under the new. There are now a Secretary of War, a\r\nSecretary of Foreign Affairs, a Secretary for Domestic Affairs, a\r\nBoard of Treasury, consisting of three persons, a Treasurer,\r\nassistants, clerks, etc. These officers are indispensable under any\r\nsystem, and will suffice under the new as well as the old. As to\r\nambassadors and other ministers and agents in foreign countries, the\r\nproposed Constitution can make no other difference than to render\r\ntheir characters, where they reside, more respectable, and their\r\nservices more useful. As to persons to be employed in the\r\ncollection of the revenues, it is unquestionably true that these\r\nwill form a very considerable addition to the number of federal\r\nofficers; but it will not follow that this will occasion an\r\nincrease of public expense. It will be in most cases nothing more\r\nthan an exchange of State for national officers. In the collection\r\nof all duties, for instance, the persons employed will be wholly of\r\nthe latter description. The States individually will stand in no\r\nneed of any for this purpose. What difference can it make in point\r\nof expense to pay officers of the customs appointed by the State or\r\nby the United States? There is no good reason to suppose that\r\neither the number or the salaries of the latter will be greater than\r\nthose of the former.\r\n\r\nWhere then are we to seek for those additional articles of\r\nexpense which are to swell the account to the enormous size that has\r\nbeen represented to us? The chief item which occurs to me respects\r\nthe support of the judges of the United States. I do not add the\r\nPresident, because there is now a president of Congress, whose\r\nexpenses may not be far, if any thing, short of those which will be\r\nincurred on account of the President of the United States. The\r\nsupport of the judges will clearly be an extra expense, but to what\r\nextent will depend on the particular plan which may be adopted in\r\nregard to this matter. But upon no reasonable plan can it amount to\r\na sum which will be an object of material consequence.\r\n\r\nLet us now see what there is to counterbalance any extra expense\r\nthat may attend the establishment of the proposed government. The\r\nfirst thing which presents itself is that a great part of the\r\nbusiness which now keeps Congress sitting through the year will be\r\ntransacted by the President. Even the management of foreign\r\nnegotiations will naturally devolve upon him, according to general\r\nprinciples concerted with the Senate, and subject to their final\r\nconcurrence. Hence it is evident that a portion of the year will\r\nsuffice for the session of both the Senate and the House of\r\nRepresentatives; we may suppose about a fourth for the latter and a\r\nthird, or perhaps half, for the former. The extra business of\r\ntreaties and appointments may give this extra occupation to the\r\nSenate. From this circumstance we may infer that, until the House\r\nof Representatives shall be increased greatly beyond its present\r\nnumber, there will be a considerable saving of expense from the\r\ndifference between the constant session of the present and the\r\ntemporary session of the future Congress.\r\n\r\nBut there is another circumstance of great importance in the\r\nview of economy. The business of the United States has hitherto\r\noccupied the State legislatures, as well as Congress. The latter\r\nhas made requisitions which the former have had to provide for.\r\nHence it has happened that the sessions of the State legislatures\r\nhave been protracted greatly beyond what was necessary for the\r\nexecution of the mere local business of the States. More than half\r\ntheir time has been frequently employed in matters which related to\r\nthe United States. Now the members who compose the legislatures of\r\nthe several States amount to two thousand and upwards, which number\r\nhas hitherto performed what under the new system will be done in the\r\nfirst instance by sixty-five persons, and probably at no future\r\nperiod by above a fourth or fifth of that number. The Congress\r\nunder the proposed government will do all the business of the United\r\nStates themselves, without the intervention of the State\r\nlegislatures, who thenceforth will have only to attend to the\r\naffairs of their particular States, and will not have to sit in any\r\nproportion as long as they have heretofore done. This difference in\r\nthe time of the sessions of the State legislatures will be clear\r\ngain, and will alone form an article of saving, which may be\r\nregarded as an equivalent for any additional objects of expense that\r\nmay be occasioned by the adoption of the new system.\r\n\r\nThe result from these observations is that the sources of\r\nadditional expense from the establishment of the proposed\r\nConstitution are much fewer than may have been imagined; that they\r\nare counterbalanced by considerable objects of saving; and that\r\nwhile it is questionable on which side the scale will preponderate,\r\nit is certain that a government less expensive would be incompetent\r\nto the purposes of the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\n\r\n1. Vide Blackstone's \"Commentaries,\" vol. 1., p. 136.\r\n\r\n2. Vide Blackstone's \"Commentaries,\" vol. iv., p. 438.\r\n\r\n3. To show that there is a power in the Constitution by which\r\nthe liberty of the press may be affected, recourse has been had to\r\nthe power of taxation.  It is said that duties may be laid upon the\r\npublications so high as to amount to a prohibition.  I know not by\r\nwhat logic it could be maintained, that the declarations in the\r\nState constitutions, in favor of the freedom of the press, would be\r\na constitutional impediment to the imposition of duties upon\r\npublications by the State legislatures. It cannot certainly be\r\npretended that any degree of duties, however low, would be an\r\nabridgment of the liberty of the press.  We know that newspapers\r\nare taxed in Great Britain, and yet it is notorious that the press\r\nnowhere enjoys greater liberty than in that country. And if duties\r\nof any kind may be laid without a violation of that liberty, it is\r\nevident that the extent must depend on legislative discretion,\r\nrespecting the liberty of the press, will give it no greater\r\nsecurity than it will have without them. The same invasions of it\r\nmay be effected under the State constitutions which contain those\r\ndeclarations through the means of taxation, as under the proposed\r\nConstitution, which has nothing of the kind. It would be quite as\r\nsignificant to declare that government ought to be free, that taxes\r\nought not to be excessive, etc., as that the liberty of the press\r\nought not to be restrained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERALIST No. 85\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConcluding Remarks\r\n\r\nFrom MCLEAN's Edition, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of the State of New York:\r\n\r\nACCORDING to the formal division of the subject of these papers,\r\nannounced in my first number, there would appear still to remain for\r\ndiscussion two points: \"the analogy of the proposed government to\r\nyour own State constitution,\" and \"the additional security which\r\nits adoption will afford to republican government, to liberty, and\r\nto property.\" But these heads have been so fully anticipated and\r\nexhausted in the progress of the work, that it would now scarcely be\r\npossible to do any thing more than repeat, in a more dilated form,\r\nwhat has been heretofore said, which the advanced stage of the\r\nquestion, and the time already spent upon it, conspire to forbid.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, that the resemblance of the plan of the\r\nconvention to the act which organizes the government of this State\r\nholds, not less with regard to many of the supposed defects, than to\r\nthe real excellences of the former. Among the pretended defects are\r\nthe re-eligibility of the Executive, the want of a council, the\r\nomission of a formal bill of rights, the omission of a provision\r\nrespecting the liberty of the press. These and several others which\r\nhave been noted in the course of our inquiries are as much\r\nchargeable on the existing constitution of this State, as on the one\r\nproposed for the Union; and a man must have slender pretensions to\r\nconsistency, who can rail at the latter for imperfections which he\r\nfinds no difficulty in excusing in the former. Nor indeed can there\r\nbe a better proof of the insincerity and affectation of some of the\r\nzealous adversaries of the plan of the convention among us, who\r\nprofess to be the devoted admirers of the government under which\r\nthey live, than the fury with which they have attacked that plan,\r\nfor matters in regard to which our own constitution is equally or\r\nperhaps more vulnerable.\r\n\r\nThe additional securities to republican government, to liberty\r\nand to property, to be derived from the adoption of the plan under\r\nconsideration, consist chiefly in the restraints which the\r\npreservation of the Union will impose on local factions and\r\ninsurrections, and on the ambition of powerful individuals in single\r\nStates, who may acquire credit and influence enough, from leaders\r\nand favorites, to become the despots of the people; in the\r\ndiminution of the opportunities to foreign intrigue, which the\r\ndissolution of the Confederacy would invite and facilitate; in the\r\nprevention of extensive military establishments, which could not\r\nfail to grow out of wars between the States in a disunited\r\nsituation; in the express guaranty of a republican form of\r\ngovernment to each; in the absolute and universal exclusion of\r\ntitles of nobility; and in the precautions against the repetition\r\nof those practices on the part of the State governments which have\r\nundermined the foundations of property and credit, have planted\r\nmutual distrust in the breasts of all classes of citizens, and have\r\noccasioned an almost universal prostration of morals.\r\n\r\nThus have I, fellow-citizens, executed the task I had assigned\r\nto myself; with what success, your conduct must determine. I trust\r\nat least you will admit that I have not failed in the assurance I\r\ngave you respecting the spirit with which my endeavors should be\r\nconducted. I have addressed myself purely to your judgments, and\r\nhave studiously avoided those asperities which are too apt to\r\ndisgrace political disputants of all parties, and which have been\r\nnot a little provoked by the language and conduct of the opponents\r\nof the Constitution. The charge of a conspiracy against the\r\nliberties of the people, which has been indiscriminately brought\r\nagainst the advocates of the plan, has something in it too wanton\r\nand too malignant, not to excite the indignation of every man who\r\nfeels in his own bosom a refutation of the calumny. The perpetual\r\nchanges which have been rung upon the wealthy, the well-born, and\r\nthe great, have been such as to inspire the disgust of all sensible\r\nmen. And the unwarrantable concealments and misrepresentations\r\nwhich have been in various ways practiced to keep the truth from the\r\npublic eye, have been of a nature to demand the reprobation of all\r\nhonest men. It is not impossible that these circumstances may have\r\noccasionally betrayed me into intemperances of expression which I\r\ndid not intend; it is certain that I have frequently felt a\r\nstruggle between sensibility and moderation; and if the former has\r\nin some instances prevailed, it must be my excuse that it has been\r\nneither often nor much.\r\n\r\nLet us now pause and ask ourselves whether, in the course of\r\nthese papers, the proposed Constitution has not been satisfactorily\r\nvindicated from the aspersions thrown upon it; and whether it has\r\nnot been shown to be worthy of the public approbation, and necessary\r\nto the public safety and prosperity. Every man is bound to answer\r\nthese questions to himself, according to the best of his conscience\r\nand understanding, and to act agreeably to the genuine and sober\r\ndictates of his judgment. This is a duty from which nothing can\r\ngive him a dispensation. 'T is one that he is called upon, nay,\r\nconstrained by all the obligations that form the bands of society,\r\nto discharge sincerely and honestly. No partial motive, no\r\nparticular interest, no pride of opinion, no temporary passion or\r\nprejudice, will justify to himself, to his country, or to his\r\nposterity, an improper election of the part he is to act. Let him\r\nbeware of an obstinate adherence to party; let him reflect that the\r\nobject upon which he is to decide is not a particular interest of\r\nthe community, but the very existence of the nation; and let him\r\nremember that a majority of America has already given its sanction\r\nto the plan which he is to approve or reject.\r\n\r\nI shall not dissemble that I feel an entire confidence in the\r\narguments which recommend the proposed system to your adoption, and\r\nthat I am unable to discern any real force in those by which it has\r\nbeen opposed. I am persuaded that it is the best which our\r\npolitical situation, habits, and opinions will admit, and superior\r\nto any the revolution has produced.\r\n\r\nConcessions on the part of the friends of the plan, that it has\r\nnot a claim to absolute perfection, have afforded matter of no small\r\ntriumph to its enemies. \"Why,\" say they, \"should we adopt an\r\nimperfect thing? Why not amend it and make it perfect before it is\r\nirrevocably established?\" This may be plausible enough, but it is\r\nonly plausible. In the first place I remark, that the extent of\r\nthese concessions has been greatly exaggerated. They have been\r\nstated as amounting to an admission that the plan is radically\r\ndefective, and that without material alterations the rights and the\r\ninterests of the community cannot be safely confided to it. This,\r\nas far as I have understood the meaning of those who make the\r\nconcessions, is an entire perversion of their sense. No advocate of\r\nthe measure can be found, who will not declare as his sentiment,\r\nthat the system, though it may not be perfect in every part, is,\r\nupon the whole, a good one; is the best that the present views and\r\ncircumstances of the country will permit; and is such an one as\r\npromises every species of security which a reasonable people can\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nI answer in the next place, that I should esteem it the extreme\r\nof imprudence to prolong the precarious state of our national\r\naffairs, and to expose the Union to the jeopardy of successive\r\nexperiments, in the chimerical pursuit of a perfect plan. I never\r\nexpect to see a perfect work from imperfect man. The result of the\r\ndeliberations of all collective bodies must necessarily be a\r\ncompound, as well of the errors and prejudices, as of the good sense\r\nand wisdom, of the individuals of whom they are composed. The\r\ncompacts which are to embrace thirteen distinct States in a common\r\nbond of amity and union, must as necessarily be a compromise of as\r\nmany dissimilar interests and inclinations. How can perfection\r\nspring from such materials?\r\n\r\nThe reasons assigned in an excellent little pamphlet lately\r\npublished in this city,1 are unanswerable to show the utter\r\nimprobability of assembling a new convention, under circumstances in\r\nany degree so favorable to a happy issue, as those in which the late\r\nconvention met, deliberated, and concluded. I will not repeat the\r\narguments there used, as I presume the production itself has had an\r\nextensive circulation. It is certainly well worthy the perusal of\r\nevery friend to his country. There is, however, one point of light\r\nin which the subject of amendments still remains to be considered,\r\nand in which it has not yet been exhibited to public view. I cannot\r\nresolve to conclude without first taking a survey of it in this\r\naspect.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me susceptible of absolute demonstration, that it\r\nwill be far more easy to obtain subsequent than previous amendments\r\nto the Constitution. The moment an alteration is made in the\r\npresent plan, it becomes, to the purpose of adoption, a new one, and\r\nmust undergo a new decision of each State. To its complete\r\nestablishment throughout the Union, it will therefore require the\r\nconcurrence of thirteen States. If, on the contrary, the\r\nConstitution proposed should once be ratified by all the States as\r\nit stands, alterations in it may at any time be effected by nine\r\nStates. Here, then, the chances are as thirteen to nine2 in\r\nfavor of subsequent amendment, rather than of the original adoption\r\nof an entire system.\r\n\r\nThis is not all. Every Constitution for the United States must\r\ninevitably consist of a great variety of particulars, in which\r\nthirteen independent States are to be accommodated in their\r\ninterests or opinions of interest. We may of course expect to see,\r\nin any body of men charged with its original formation, very\r\ndifferent combinations of the parts upon different points. Many of\r\nthose who form a majority on one question, may become the minority\r\non a second, and an association dissimilar to either may constitute\r\nthe majority on a third. Hence the necessity of moulding and\r\narranging all the particulars which are to compose the whole, in\r\nsuch a manner as to satisfy all the parties to the compact; and\r\nhence, also, an immense multiplication of difficulties and\r\ncasualties in obtaining the collective assent to a final act. The\r\ndegree of that multiplication must evidently be in a ratio to the\r\nnumber of particulars and the number of parties.\r\n\r\nBut every amendment to the Constitution, if once established,\r\nwould be a single proposition, and might be brought forward singly.\r\nThere would then be no necessity for management or compromise, in\r\nrelation to any other point no giving nor taking. The will of the\r\nrequisite number would at once bring the matter to a decisive issue.\r\nAnd consequently, whenever nine, or rather ten States, were united\r\nin the desire of a particular amendment, that amendment must\r\ninfallibly take place. There can, therefore, be no comparison\r\nbetween the facility of affecting an amendment, and that of\r\nestablishing in the first instance a complete Constitution.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to the probability of subsequent amendments, it\r\nhas been urged that the persons delegated to the administration of\r\nthe national government will always be disinclined to yield up any\r\nportion of the authority of which they were once possessed. For my\r\nown part I acknowledge a thorough conviction that any amendments\r\nwhich may, upon mature consideration, be thought useful, will be\r\napplicable to the organization of the government, not to the mass of\r\nits powers; and on this account alone, I think there is no weight\r\nin the observation just stated. I also think there is little weight\r\nin it on another account. The intrinsic difficulty of governing\r\nthirteen States at any rate, independent of calculations upon an\r\nordinary degree of public spirit and integrity, will, in my opinion\r\nconstantly impose on the national rulers the necessity of a spirit\r\nof accommodation to the reasonable expectations of their\r\nconstituents. But there is yet a further consideration, which\r\nproves beyond the possibility of a doubt, that the observation is\r\nfutile. It is this that the national rulers, whenever nine States\r\nconcur, will have no option upon the subject. By the fifth article\r\nof the plan, the Congress will be obliged \"on the application of the\r\nlegislatures of two thirds of the States, which at present amount to\r\nnine, to call a convention for proposing amendments, which shall be\r\nvalid, to all intents and purposes, as part of the Constitution,\r\nwhen ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the States, or\r\nby conventions in three fourths thereof.\" The words of this\r\narticle are peremptory. The Congress \"shall call a convention.\"\r\nNothing in this particular is left to the discretion of that body.\r\nAnd of consequence, all the declamation about the disinclination to\r\na change vanishes in air. Nor however difficult it may be supposed\r\nto unite two thirds or three fourths of the State legislatures, in\r\namendments which may affect local interests, can there be any room\r\nto apprehend any such difficulty in a union on points which are\r\nmerely relative to the general liberty or security of the people.\r\nWe may safely rely on the disposition of the State legislatures to\r\nerect barriers against the encroachments of the national authority.\r\n\r\nIf the foregoing argument is a fallacy, certain it is that I am\r\nmyself deceived by it, for it is, in my conception, one of those\r\nrare instances in which a political truth can be brought to the test\r\nof a mathematical demonstration. Those who see the matter in the\r\nsame light with me, however zealous they may be for amendments, must\r\nagree in the propriety of a previous adoption, as the most direct\r\nroad to their own object.\r\n\r\nThe zeal for attempts to amend, prior to the establishment of\r\nthe Constitution, must abate in every man who is ready to accede to\r\nthe truth of the following observations of a writer equally solid\r\nand ingenious: \"To balance a large state or society Usays hee,\r\nwhether monarchical or republican, on general laws, is a work of so\r\ngreat difficulty, that no human genius, however comprehensive, is\r\nable, by the mere dint of reason and reflection, to effect it. The\r\njudgments of many must unite in the work; experience must guide\r\ntheir labor; time must bring it to perfection, and the feeling of\r\ninconveniences must correct the mistakes which they INEVITABLY fall\r\ninto in their first trials and experiments.\"3 These judicious\r\nreflections contain a lesson of moderation to all the sincere lovers\r\nof the Union, and ought to put them upon their guard against\r\nhazarding anarchy, civil war, a perpetual alienation of the States\r\nfrom each other, and perhaps the military despotism of a victorious\r\ndemagogue, in the pursuit of what they are not likely to obtain, but\r\nfrom time and experience. It may be in me a defect of political\r\nfortitude, but I acknowledge that I cannot entertain an equal\r\ntranquillity with those who affect to treat the dangers of a longer\r\ncontinuance in our present situation as imaginary. A nation,\r\nwithout a national government, is, in my view, an awful spectacle.\r\nThe establishment of a Constitution, in time of profound peace, by\r\nthe voluntary consent of a whole people, is a prodigy, to the\r\ncompletion of which I look forward with trembling anxiety. I can\r\nreconcile it to no rules of prudence to let go the hold we now have,\r\nin so arduous an enterprise, upon seven out of the thirteen States,\r\nand after having passed over so considerable a part of the ground,\r\nto recommence the course.

Yea, how long will ye choose darkness\r\nrather than light?\r\n\r\nHelaman 13:30\r\n 30 Yea, behold, the anger of the Lord is already kindled against\r\nyou; behold, he hath cursed the land because of your iniquity.\r\n\r\nHelaman 13:31\r\n 31 And behold, the time cometh that he curseth your riches, that\r\nthey become slippery, that ye cannot hold them; and in the days\r\nof your poverty ye cannot retain them.\r\n\r\nHelaman 13:32\r\n 32 And in the days of your poverty ye shall cry unto the Lord;\r\nand in vain shall ye cry, for your desolation is already come\r\nupon you, and your destruction is made sure; and then shall ye\r\nweep and howl in that day, saith the Lord of Hosts. And then\r\nshall ye lament, and say:\r\n\r\nHelaman 13:33\r\n 33 O that I had repented, and had not killed the prophets, and\r\nstoned them, and cast them out. Yea, in that day ye shall say: O\r\nthat we had remembered the Lord our God in the day that he gave\r\nus our riches, and then they would not have become slippery that\r\nwe should lose them; for behold, our riches are gone from us.\r\n\r\nHelaman 13:34\r\n 34 Behold, we lay a tool here and on the morrow it is gone; and\r\nbehold, our swords are taken from us in the day we have sought\r\nthem for battle.\r\n\r\nHelaman 13:35\r\n 35 Yea, we have hid up our treasures and they have slipped away\r\nfrom us, because of the curse of the land.\r\n\r\nHelaman 13:36\r\n 36 O that we had repented in the day that the word of the Lord\r\ncame unto us; for behold the land is cursed, and all things are\r\nbecome slippery, and we cannot hold them.\r\n\r\nHelaman 13:37\r\n 37 Behold, we are surrounded by demons, yea, we are encircled\r\nabout by the angels of him who hath sought to destroy our souls.\r\nBehold, our iniquities are great. O Lord, canst thou not turn\r\naway thine anger from us? And this shall be your language in\r\nthose days.\r\n\r\nHelaman 13:38\r\n 38 But behold, your days of probation are past; ye have\r\nprocrastinated the day of your salvation until it is\r\neverlastingly too late, and your destruction is made sure; yea,\r\nfor ye have sought all the days of your lives for that which ye\r\ncould not obtain; and ye have sought for happiness in doing\r\niniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of that\r\nrighteousness which is in our great and Eternal Head.\r\n\r\nHelaman 13:39\r\n 39 O ye people of the land, that ye would hear my words!

for behold, there shall be great lights in heaven,\r\ninsomuch that in the night before he cometh there shall be no\r\ndarkness, insomuch that it shall appear unto man as if it was\r\nday.\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:4\r\n 4 Therefore, there shall be one day and a night and a day, as if\r\nit were one day and there were no night; and this shall be unto\r\nyou for a sign; for ye shall know of the rising of the sun and\r\nalso of its setting; therefore they shall know of a surety that\r\nthere shall be two days and a night; nevertheless the night shall\r\nnot be darkened; and it shall be the night before he is born.\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:5\r\n 5 And behold, there shall a new star arise, such an one as ye\r\nnever have beheld; and this also shall be a sign unto you.\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:6\r\n 6 And behold this is not all, there shall be many signs and\r\nwonders in heaven.\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:7\r\n 7 And it shall come to pass that ye shall all be amazed, and\r\nwonder, insomuch that ye shall fall to the earth.\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:8\r\n 8 And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall believe on the\r\nSon of God, the same shall have everlasting life.\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:9\r\n 9 And behold, thus hath the Lord commanded me, by his angel,\r\nthat I should come and tell this thing unto you; yea, he hath\r\ncommanded that I should prophesy these things unto you; yea, he\r\nhath said unto me: Cry unto this people, repent and prepare the\r\nway of the Lord.\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:10\r\n 10 And now, because I am a Lamanite, and have spoken unto you\r\nthe words which the Lord hath commanded me, and because it was\r\nhard against you, ye are angry with me and do seek to destroy me,\r\nand have cast me out from among you.\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:11\r\n 11 And ye shall hear my words, for, for this intent have I come\r\nup upon the walls of this city, that ye might hear and know of\r\nthe judgments of God which do await you because of your\r\niniquities, and also that ye might know the conditions of\r\nrepentance;\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:12\r\n 12 And also that ye might know of the coming of Jesus Christ,\r\nthe Son of God, the Father of heaven and of earth, the Creator of\r\nall things from the beginning; and that ye might know of the\r\nsigns of his coming, to the intent that ye might believe on his\r\nname.\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:13\r\n 13 And if ye believe on his name ye will repent of all your\r\nsins, that thereby ye may have a remission of them through his\r\nmerits.\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:14\r\n 14 And behold, again, another sign I give unto you, yea, a sign\r\nof his death.\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:15\r\n 15 For behold, he surely must die that salvation may come; yea,\r\nit behooveth him and becometh expedient that he dieth, to bring\r\nto pass the resurrection of the dead, that thereby men may be\r\nbrought into the presence of the Lord.\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:16\r\n 16 Yea, behold, this death bringeth to pass the resurrection,\r\nand redeemeth all mankind from the first death--that spiritual\r\ndeath; for all mankind, by the fall of Adam being cut off from\r\nthe presence of the Lord, are considered as dead, both as to\r\nthings temporal and to things spiritual.\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:17\r\n 17 But behold, the resurrection of Christ redeemeth mankind,\r\nyea, even all mankind, and bringeth them back into the presence\r\nof the Lord.\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:18\r\n 18 Yea, and it bringeth to pass the condition of repentance,\r\nthat whosoever repenteth the same is not hewn down and cast into\r\nthe fire; but whosoever repenteth not is hewn down and cast into\r\nthe fire; and there cometh upon them again a spiritual death,\r\nyea, a second death, for they are cut off again as to things\r\npertaining to righteousness.\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:19\r\n 19 Therefore repent ye, repent ye, lest by knowing these things\r\nand not doing them ye shall suffer yourselves to come under\r\ncondemnation, and ye are brought down unto this second death.\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:20\r\n 20 But behold, as I said unto you concerning another sign, a\r\nsign of his death, behold, in that day that he shall suffer death\r\nthe sun shall be darkened and refuse to give his light unto you;\r\nand also the moon and the stars; and there shall be no light upon\r\nthe face of this land, even from the time that he shall suffer\r\ndeath, for the space of three days, to the time that he shall\r\nrise again from the dead.\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:21\r\n 21 Yea, at the time that he shall yield up the ghost there shall\r\nbe thunderings and lightnings for the space of many hours, and\r\nthe earth shall shake and tremble; and the rocks which are upon\r\nthe face of this earth, which are both above the earth and\r\nbeneath, which ye know at this time are solid, or the more part\r\nof it is one solid mass, shall be broken up;\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:22\r\n 22 Yea, they shall be rent in twain, and shall ever after be\r\nfound in seams and in cracks, and in broken fragments upon the\r\nface of the whole earth, yea, both above the earth and beneath.\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:23\r\n 23 And behold, there shall be great tempests, and there shall be\r\nmany mountains laid low, like unto a valley, and there shall be\r\nmany places which are now called valleys which shall become\r\nmountains, whose height is great.\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:24\r\n 24 And many highways shall be broken up, and many cities shall\r\nbecome desolate.\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:25\r\n 25 And many graves shall be opened, and shall yield up many of\r\ntheir dead; and many saints shall appear unto many.\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:26\r\n 26 And behold, thus hath the angel spoken unto me; for he said\r\nunto me that there should be thunderings and lightnings for the\r\nspace of many hours.\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:27\r\n 27 And he said unto me that while the thunder and the lightning\r\nlasted, and the tempest, that these things should be, and that\r\ndarkness should cover the face of the whole earth for the space\r\nof three days.\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:28\r\n 28 And the angel said unto me that many shall see greater things\r\nthan these, to the intent that they might believe that these\r\nsigns and these wonders should come to pass upon all the face of\r\nthis land, to the intent that there should be no cause for\r\nunbelief among the children of men--\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:29\r\n 29 And this to the intent that whosoever will believe might be\r\nsaved, and that whosoever will not believe, a righteous judgment\r\nmight come upon them; and also if they are condemned they bring\r\nupon themselves their own condemnation.\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:30\r\n 30 And now remember, remember, my brethren, that whosoever\r\nperisheth, perisheth unto himself; and whosoever doeth iniquity,\r\ndoeth it unto himself; for behold, ye are free; ye are permitted\r\nto act for yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a\r\nknowledge and he hath made you free.\r\n\r\nHelaman 14:31\r\n 31 He hath given unto you that ye might know good from evil, and\r\nhe hath given unto you that ye might choose life or death; and ye\r\ncan do good and be restored unto that which is good, or have that\r\nwhich is good restored unto you; or ye can do evil, and have that\r\nwhich is evil restored unto you.\r\n\r\nHelaman 15\r\nChapter 15\r\n\r\nHelaman 15:1\r\n 1 And now, my beloved brethren, behold, I declare unto you that\r\nexcept ye shall repent your houses shall be left unto you\r\ndesolate.\r\n\r\nHelaman 15:2\r\n 2 Yea, except ye repent, your women shall have great cause to\r\nmourn in the day that they shall give suck; for ye shall attempt\r\nto flee and there shall be no place for refuge; yea, and wo unto\r\nthem which are with child, for they shall be heavy and cannot\r\nflee; therefore, they shall be trodden down and shall be left to\r\nperish.\r\n\r\nHelaman 15:3\r\n 3 Yea, wo unto this people who are called the people of Nephi\r\nexcept they shall repent, when they shall see all these signs and\r\nwonders which shall be showed unto them; for behold, they have\r\nbeen a chosen people of the Lord; yea, the people of Nephi hath\r\nhe loved, and also hath he chastened them; yea, in the days of\r\ntheir iniquities hath he chastened them because he loveth them.\r\n\r\nHelaman 15:4\r\n 4 But behold my brethren, the Lamanites hath he hated because\r\ntheir deeds have been evil continually, and this because of the\r\niniquity of the tradition of their fathers. But behold,\r\nsalvation hath come unto them through the preaching of the\r\nNephites; and for this intent hath the Lord prolonged their days.\r\n\r\nHelaman 15:5\r\n 5 And I would that ye should behold that the more part of them\r\nare in the path of their duty, and they do walk circumspectly\r\nbefore God, and they do observe to keep his commandments and his\r\nstatutes and his judgments according to the law of Moses.\r\n\r\nHelaman 15:6\r\n 6 Yea, I say unto you, that the more part of them are doing\r\nthis, and they are striving with unwearied diligence that they\r\nmay bring the remainder of their brethren to the knowledge of the\r\ntruth; therefore there are many who do add to their numbers\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\nHelaman 15:7\r\n 7 And behold, ye do know of yourselves, for ye have witnessed\r\nit, that as many of them as are brought to the knowledge of the\r\ntruth, and to know of the wicked and abominable traditions of\r\ntheir fathers, and are led to believe the holy scriptures, yea,\r\nthe prophecies of the holy prophets, which are written, which\r\nleadeth them to faith on the Lord, and unto repentance, which\r\nfaith and repentance bringeth a change of heart unto them--\r\n\r\nHelaman 15:8\r\n 8 Therefore, as many as have come to this, ye know of yourselves\r\nare firm and steadfast in the faith, and in the thing wherewith\r\nthey have been made free.\r\n\r\nHelaman 15:9\r\n 9 And ye know also that they have buried their weapons of war,\r\nand they fear to take them up lest by any means they should sin;\r\nyea, ye can see that they fear to sin--for behold they will\r\nsuffer themselves that they be trodden down and slain by their\r\nenemies, and will not lift their swords against them, and this\r\nbecause of their faith in Christ.\r\n\r\nHelaman 15:10\r\n 10 And now, because of their steadfastness when they do believe\r\nin that thing which they do believe, for because of their\r\nfirmness when they are once enlightened, behold, the Lord shall\r\nbless them and prolong their days, notwithstanding their\r\niniquity--\r\n\r\nHelaman 15:11\r\n 11 Yea, even if they should dwindle in unbelief the Lord shall\r\nprolong their days, until the time shall come which hath been\r\nspoken of by our fathers, and also by the prophet Zenos, and many\r\nother prophets, concerning the restoration of our brethren, the\r\nLamanites, again to the knowledge of the truth--\r\n\r\nHelaman 15:12\r\n 12 Yea, I say unto you, that in the latter times the promises of\r\nthe Lord have been extended to our brethren, the Lamanites; and\r\nnotwithstanding the many afflictions which they shall have, and\r\nnotwithstanding they shall be driven to and fro upon the face of\r\nthe earth, and be hunted, and shall be smitten and scattered\r\nabroad, having no place for refuge, the Lord shall be merciful\r\nunto them.\r\n\r\nHelaman 15:13\r\n 13 And this is according to the prophecy, that they shall again\r\nbe brought to the true knowledge, which is knowledge of their\r\nRedeemer, and their great and true shepherd, and be numbered\r\namong his sheep.\r\n\r\nHelaman 15:14\r\n 14 Therefore I say unto you, it shall be better for them than\r\nfor you except ye repent.\r\n\r\nHelaman 15:15\r\n 15 For behold, had the mighty works been shown unto them which\r\nhave been shown unto you, yea, unto them who have dwindled in\r\nunbelief because of the traditions of their fathers, ye can see\r\nof yourselves that they never would again have dwindled in\r\nunbelief.\r\n\r\nHelaman 15:16\r\n 16 Therefore, saith the Lord: I will not utterly destroy them,\r\nbut I will cause that in the day of my wisdom they shall return\r\nagain unto me, saith the Lord.\r\n\r\nHelaman 15:17\r\n 17 And now behold, saith the Lord, concerning the people of the\r\nNephites: If they will not repent, and observe to do my will, I\r\nwill utterly destroy them, saith the Lord, because of their\r\nunbelief notwithstanding the many mighty works which I have done\r\namong them; and as surely as the Lord liveth shall these things\r\nbe, saith the Lord.\r\n\r\nHelaman 16\r\nChapter 16\r\n\r\nHelaman 16:1\r\n 1 And now, it came to pass that there were many who heard the\r\nwords of Samuel, the Lamanite, which he spake upon the walls of\r\nthe city. And as many as believed on his word went forth and\r\nsought for Nephi; and when they had come forth and found him they\r\nconfessed unto him their sins and denied not, desiring that they\r\nmight be baptized unto the Lord.\r\n\r\nHelaman 16:2\r\n 2 But as many as there were who did not believe in the words of\r\nSamuel were angry with him; and they cast stones at him upon the\r\nwall, and also many shot arrows at him as he stood upon the wall;\r\nbut the Spirit of the Lord was with him, insomuch that they could\r\nnot hit him with their stones neither with their arrows.\r\n\r\nHelaman 16:3\r\n 3 Now when they saw that they could not hit him, there were many\r\nmore who did believe on his words, insomuch that they went away\r\nunto Nephi to be baptized.\r\n\r\nHelaman 16:4\r\n 4 For behold, Nephi was baptizing, and prophesying, and\r\npreaching, crying repentance unto the people, showing signs and\r\nwonders, working miracles among the people, that they might know\r\nthat the Christ must shortly come--\r\n\r\nHelaman 16:5\r\n 5 Telling them of things which must shortly come, that they\r\nmight know and remember at the time of their coming that they had\r\nbeen made known unto them beforehand, to the intent that they\r\nmight believe; therefore as many as believed on the words of\r\nSamuel went forth unto him to be baptized, for they came\r\nrepenting and confessing their sins.\r\n\r\nHelaman 16:6\r\n 6 But the more part of them did not believe in the words of\r\nSamuel; therefore when they saw that they could not hit him with\r\ntheir stones and their arrows, they cried unto their captains,\r\nsaying: Take this fellow and bind him, for behold he hath a\r\ndevil; and because of the power of the devil which is in him we\r\ncannot hit him with our stones and our arrows; therefore take him\r\nand bind him, and away with him.\r\n\r\nHelaman 16:7\r\n 7 And as they went forth to lay their hands on him, behold, he\r\ndid cast himself down from the wall, and did flee out of their\r\nlands, yea, even unto his own country, and began to preach and to\r\nprophesy among his own people.\r\n\r\nHelaman 16:8\r\n 8 And behold, he was never heard of more among the Nephites; and\r\nthus were the affairs of the people.\r\n\r\nHelaman 16:9\r\n 9 And thus ended the eighty and sixth year of the reign of the\r\njudges over the people of Nephi.\r\n\r\nHelaman 16:10\r\n 10 And thus ended also the eighty and seventh year of the reign\r\nof the judges, the more part of the people remaining in their\r\npride and wickedness, and the lesser part walking more\r\ncircumspectly before God.\r\n\r\nHelaman 16:11\r\n 11 And these were the conditions also, in the eighty and eighth\r\nyear of the reign of the judges.\r\n\r\nHelaman 16:12\r\n 12 And there was but little alteration in the affairs of the\r\npeople, save it were the people began to be more hardened in\r\niniquity, and do more and more of that which was contrary to the\r\ncommandments of God, in the eighty and ninth year of the reign of\r\nthe judges.\r\n\r\nHelaman 16:13\r\n 13 But it came to pass in the ninetieth year of the reign of the\r\njudges, there were great signs given unto the people, and\r\nwonders; and the words of the prophets began to be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nHelaman 16:14\r\n 14 And angels did appear unto men, wise men, and did declare\r\nunto them glad tidings of great joy; thus in this year the\r\nscriptures began to be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nHelaman 16:15\r\n 15 Nevertheless, the people began to harden their hearts, all\r\nsave it were the most believing part of them, both of the\r\nNephites and also of the Lamanites, and began to depend upon\r\ntheir own strength and upon their own wisdom, saying:\r\n\r\nHelaman 16:16\r\n 16 Some things they may have guessed right, among so many; but\r\nbehold, we know that all these great and marvelous works cannot\r\ncome to pass, of which has been spoken.\r\n\r\nHelaman 16:17\r\n 17 And they began to reason and to contend among themselves,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\nHelaman 16:18\r\n 18 That it is not reasonable that such a being as a Christ shall\r\ncome; if so, and he be the Son of God, the Father of heaven and\r\nof earth, as it has been spoken, why will he not show himself\r\nunto us as well as unto them who shall be at Jerusalem?\r\n\r\nHelaman 16:19\r\n 19 Yea, why will he not show himself in this land as well as in\r\nthe land of Jerusalem?\r\n\r\nHelaman 16:20\r\n 20 But behold, we know that this is a wicked tradition, which\r\nhas been handed down unto us by our fathers, to cause us that we\r\nshould believe in some great and marvelous thing which should\r\ncome to pass, but not among us, but in a land which is far\r\ndistant, a land which we know not; therefore they can keep us in\r\nignorance, for we cannot witness with our own eyes that they are\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nHelaman 16:21\r\n 21 And they will, by the cunning and the mysterious arts of the\r\nevil one, work some great mystery which we cannot understand,\r\nwhich will keep us down to be servants to their words, and also\r\nservants unto them, for we depend upon them to teach us the word;\r\nand thus will they keep us in ignorance if we will yield\r\nourselves unto them, all the days of our lives.\r\n\r\nHelaman 16:22\r\n 22 And many more things did the people imagine up in their\r\nhearts, which were foolish and vain; and they were much\r\ndisturbed, for Satan did stir them up to do iniquity continually;\r\nyea, he did go about spreading rumors and contentions upon all\r\nthe face of the land, that he might harden the hearts of the\r\npeople against that which was good and against that which should\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nHelaman 16:23\r\n 23 And notwithstanding the signs and the wonders which were\r\nwrought among the people of the Lord, and the many miracles which\r\nthey did, Satan did get great hold upon the hearts of the people\r\nupon all the face of the land.\r\n\r\nHelaman 16:24\r\n 24 And thus ended the ninetieth year of the reign of the judges\r\nover the people of Nephi.\r\n\r\nHelaman 16:25\r\n 25 And thus ended the book of Helaman, according to the record\r\nof Helaman and his sons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD BOOK OF NEPHI\r\n\r\nTHE SON OF NEPHI, WHO WAS THE SON OF HELAMAN\r\n\r\nAnd Helaman was the son of Helaman, who was the son of Alma, who\r\nwas the son of Alma, being a descendant of Nephi who was the son\r\nof Lehi, who came out of Jerusalem in the first year of the reign\r\nof Zedekiah, the king of Judah.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1\r\nChapter 1\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:1\r\n 1 Now it came to pass that the ninety and first year had passed\r\naway and it was six hundred years from the time that Lehi left\r\nJerusalem; and it was in the year that Lachoneus was the chief\r\njudge and the governor over the land.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:2\r\n 2 And Nephi, the son of Helaman, had departed out of the land of\r\nZarahemla, giving charge unto his son Nephi, who was his eldest\r\nson, concerning the plates of brass, and all the records which\r\nhad been kept, and all those things which had been kept sacred\r\nfrom the departure of Lehi out of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:3\r\n 3 Then he departed out of the land, and whither he went, no man\r\nknoweth; and his son Nephi did keep the records in his stead,\r\nyea, the record of this people.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:4\r\n 4 And it came to pass that in the commencement of the ninety and\r\nsecond year, behold, the prophecies of the prophets began to be\r\nfulfilled more fully; for there began to be greater signs and\r\ngreater miracles wrought among the people.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:5\r\n 5 But there were some who began to say that the time was past\r\nfor the words to be fulfilled, which were spoken by Samuel, the\r\nLamanite.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:6\r\n 6 And they began to rejoice over their brethren, saying: Behold\r\nthe time is past, and the words of Samuel are not fulfilled;\r\ntherefore, your joy and your faith concerning this thing hath\r\nbeen vain.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:7\r\n 7 And it came to pass that they did make a great uproar\r\nthroughout the land; and the people who believed began to be very\r\nsorrowful, lest by any means those things which had been spoken\r\nmight not come to pass.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:8\r\n 8 But behold, they did watch steadfastly for that day and that\r\nnight and that day which should be as one day as if there were no\r\nnight, that they might know that their faith had not been vain.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:9\r\n 9 Now it came to pass that there was a day set apart by the\r\nunbelievers, that all those who believed in those traditions\r\nshould be put to death except the sign should come to pass, which\r\nhad been given by Samuel the prophet.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:10\r\n 10 Now it came to pass that when Nephi, the son of Nephi, saw\r\nthis wickedness of his people, his heart was exceedingly\r\nsorrowful.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:11\r\n 11 And it came to pass that he went out and bowed himself down\r\nupon the earth, and cried mightily to his God in behalf of his\r\npeople, yea, those who were about to be destroyed because of\r\ntheir faith in the tradition of their fathers.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:12\r\n 12 And it came to pass that he cried mightily unto the Lord, all\r\nthat day; and behold, the voice of the Lord came unto him,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:13\r\n 13 Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for behold, the time\r\nis at hand, and on this night shall the sign be given, and on the\r\nmorrow come I into the world, to show unto the world that I will\r\nfulfill all that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of\r\nmy holy prophets.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:14\r\n 14 Behold, I come unto my own, to fulfill all things which I\r\nhave made known unto the children of men from the foundation of\r\nthe world, and to do the will, both of the Father and of the\r\nSon--of the Father because of me, and of the Son because of my\r\nflesh. And behold, the time is at hand, and this night shall the\r\nsign be given.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:15\r\n 15 And it came to pass that the words which came unto Nephi were\r\nfulfilled, according as they had been spoken; for behold, at the\r\ngoing down of the sun there was no darkness; and the people began\r\nto be astonished because there was no darkness when the night\r\ncame.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:16\r\n 16 And there were many, who had not believed the words of the\r\nprophets, who fell to the earth and became as if they were dead,\r\nfor they knew that the great plan of destruction which they had\r\nlaid for those who believed in the words of the prophets had been\r\nfrustrated; for the sign which had been given was already at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:17\r\n 17 And they began to know that the Son of God must shortly\r\nappear; yea, in fine, all the people upon the face of the whole\r\nearth from the west to the east, both in the land north and in\r\nthe land south, were so exceedingly astonished that they fell to\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:18\r\n 18 For they knew that the prophets had testified of these things\r\nfor many years, and that the sign which had been given was\r\nalready at hand; and they began to fear because of their iniquity\r\nand their unbelief.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:19\r\n 19 And it came to pass that there was no darkness in all that\r\nnight, but it was as light as though it was mid-day. And it came\r\nto pass that the sun did rise in the morning again, according to\r\nits proper order; and they knew that it was the day that the Lord\r\nshould be born, because of the sign which had been given.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:20\r\n 20 And it had come to pass, yea, all things, every whit,\r\naccording to the words of the prophets.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:21\r\n 21 And it came to pass also that a new star did appear,\r\naccording to the word.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:22\r\n 22 And it came to pass that from this time forth there began to\r\nbe lyings sent forth among the people, by Satan, to harden their\r\nhearts, to the intent that they might not believe in those signs\r\nand wonders which they had seen; but notwithstanding these lyings\r\nand deceivings the more part of the people did believe, and were\r\nconverted unto the Lord.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:23\r\n 23 And it came to pass that Nephi went forth among the people,\r\nand also many others, baptizing unto repentance, in the which\r\nthere was a great remission of sins. And thus the people began\r\nagain to have peace in the land.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:24\r\n 24 And there were no contentions, save it were a few that began\r\nto preach, endeavoring to prove by the scriptures that it was no\r\nmore expedient to observe the law of Moses. Now in this thing\r\nthey did err, having not understood the scriptures.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:25\r\n 25 But it came to pass that they soon became converted, and were\r\nconvinced of the error which they were in, for it was made known\r\nunto them that the law was not yet fulfilled, and that it must be\r\nfulfilled in every whit; yea, the word came unto them that it\r\nmust be fulfilled; yea, that one jot or tittle should not pass\r\naway till it should all be fulfilled; therefore in this same year\r\nwere they brought to a knowledge of their error and did confess\r\ntheir faults.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:26\r\n 26 And thus the ninety and second year did pass away, bringing\r\nglad tidings unto the people because of the signs which did come\r\nto pass, according to the words of the prophecy of all the holy\r\nprophets.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:27\r\n 27 And it came to pass that the ninety and third year did also\r\npass away in peace, save it were for the Gadianton robbers, who\r\ndwelt upon the mountains, who did infest the land; for so strong\r\nwere their holds and their secret places that the people could\r\nnot overpower them; therefore they did commit many murders, and\r\ndid do much slaughter among the people.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:28\r\n 28 And it came to pass that in the ninety and fourth year they\r\nbegan to increase in great degree, because there were many\r\ndissenters of the Nephites who did flee unto them, which did\r\ncause much sorrow unto those Nephites who did remain in the land.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:29\r\n 29 And there was also a cause of much sorrow among the\r\nLamanites; for behold, they had many children who did grow up and\r\nbegan to wax strong in years, that they became for themselves,\r\nand were led away by some who were Zoramites, by their lyings and\r\ntheir flattering words, to join those Gadianton robbers.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 1:30\r\n 30 And thus were the Lamanites afflicted also, and began to\r\ndecrease as to their faith and righteousness, because of the\r\nwickedness of the rising generation.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 2\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 2:1\r\n 1 And it came to pass that thus passed away the ninety and fifth\r\nyear also, and the people began to forget those signs and wonders\r\nwhich they had heard, and began to be less and less astonished at\r\na sign or a wonder from heaven, insomuch that they began to be\r\nhard in their hearts, and blind in their minds, and began to\r\ndisbelieve all which they had heard and seen--\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 2:2\r\n 2 Imagining up some vain thing in their hearts, that it was\r\nwrought by men and by the power of the devil, to lead away and\r\ndeceive the hearts of the people; and thus did Satan get\r\npossession of the hearts of the people again, insomuch that he\r\ndid blind their eyes and lead them away to believe that the\r\ndoctrine of Christ was a foolish and a vain thing.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 2:3\r\n 3 And it came to pass that the people began to wax strong in\r\nwickedness and abominations; and they did not believe that there\r\nshould be any more signs or wonders given; and Satan did go\r\nabout, leading away the hearts of the people, tempting them and\r\ncausing them that they should do great wickedness in the land.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 2:4\r\n 4 And thus did pass away the ninety and sixth year; and also the\r\nninety and seventh year; and also the ninety and eighth year; and\r\nalso the ninety and ninth year;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 2:5\r\n 5 And also an hundred years had passed away since the days of\r\nMosiah, who was king over the people of the Nephites.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 2:6\r\n 6 And six hundred and nine years had passed away since Lehi left\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 2:7\r\n 7 And nine years had passed away from the time when the sign was\r\ngiven, which was spoken of by the prophets, that Christ should\r\ncome into the world.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 2:8\r\n 8 Now the Nephites began to reckon their time from this period\r\nwhen the sign was given, or from the coming of Christ; therefore,\r\nnine years had passed away.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 2:9\r\n 9 And Nephi, who was the father of Nephi, who had the charge of\r\nthe records, did not return to the land of Zarahemla, and could\r\nnowhere be found in all the land.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 2:10\r\n 10 And it came to pass that the people did still remain in\r\nwickedness, notwithstanding the much preaching and prophesying\r\nwhich was sent among them; and thus passed away the tenth year\r\nalso; and the eleventh year also passed away in iniquity.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 2:11\r\n 11 And it came to pass in the thirteenth year there began to be\r\nwars and contentions throughout all the land; for the Gadianton\r\nrobbers had become so numerous, and did slay so many of the\r\npeople, and did lay waste so many cities, and did spread so much\r\ndeath and carnage throughout the land, that it became expedient\r\nthat all the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, should\r\ntake up arms against them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 2:12\r\n 12 Therefore, all the Lamanites who had become converted unto\r\nthe Lord did unite with their brethren, the Nephites, and were\r\ncompelled, for the safety of their lives and their women and\r\ntheir children, to take up arms against those Gadianton robbers,\r\nyea, and also to maintain their rights, and the privileges of\r\ntheir church and of their worship, and their freedom and their\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 2:13\r\n 13 And it came to pass that before this thirteenth year had\r\npassed away the Nephites were threatened with utter destruction\r\nbecause of this war, which had become exceedingly sore.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 2:14\r\n 14 And it came to pass that those Lamanites who had united with\r\nthe Nephites were numbered among the Nephites;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 2:15\r\n 15 And their curse was taken from them, and their skin became\r\nwhite like unto the Nephites;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 2:16\r\n 16 And their young men and their daughters became exceedingly\r\nfair, and they were numbered among the Nephites, and were called\r\nNephites. And thus ended the thirteenth year.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 2:17\r\n 17 And it came to pass in the commencement of the fourteenth\r\nyear, the war between the robbers and the people of Nephi did\r\ncontinue and did become exceedingly sore; nevertheless, the\r\npeople of Nephi did gain some advantage of the robbers, insomuch\r\nthat they did drive them back out of their lands into the\r\nmountains and into their secret places.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 2:18\r\n 18 And thus ended the fourteenth year. And in the fifteenth\r\nyear they did come forth against the people of Nephi; and because\r\nof the wickedness of the people of Nephi, and their many\r\ncontentions and dissensions, the Gadianton robbers did gain many\r\nadvantages over them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 2:19\r\n 19 And thus ended the fifteenth year, and thus were the people\r\nin a state of many afflictions; and the sword of destruction did\r\nhang over them, insomuch that they were about to be smitten down\r\nby it, and this because of their iniquity.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:1\r\n 1 And now it came to pass that in the sixteenth year from the\r\ncoming of Christ, Lachoneus, the governor of the land, received\r\nan epistle from the leader and the governor of this band of\r\nrobbers; and these were the words which were written, saying:\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:2\r\n 2 Lachoneus, most noble and chief governor of the land, behold,\r\nI write this epistle unto you, and do give unto you exceedingly\r\ngreat praise because of your firmness, and also the firmness of\r\nyour people, in maintaining that which ye suppose to be your\r\nright and liberty; yea, ye do stand well, as if ye were supported\r\nby the hand of a god, in the defence of your liberty, and your\r\nproperty, and your country, or that which ye do call so.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:3\r\n 3 And it seemeth a pity unto me, most noble Lachoneus, that ye\r\nshould be so foolish and vain as to suppose that ye can stand\r\nagainst so many brave men who are at my command, who do now at\r\nthis time stand in their arms, and do await with great anxiety\r\nfor the word--Go down upon the Nephites and destroy them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:4\r\n 4 And I, knowing of their unconquerable spirit, having proved\r\nthem in the field of battle, and knowing of their everlasting\r\nhatred towards you because of the many wrongs which ye have done\r\nunto them, therefore if they should come down against you they\r\nwould visit you with utter destruction.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:5\r\n 5 Therefore I have written this epistle, sealing it with mine\r\nown hand, feeling for your welfare, because of your firmness in\r\nthat which ye believe to be right, and your noble spirit in the\r\nfield of battle.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:6\r\n 6 Therefore I write unto you, desiring that ye would yield up\r\nunto this my people, your cities, your lands, and your\r\npossessions, rather than that they should visit you with the\r\nsword and that destruction should come upon you.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:7\r\n 7 Or in other words, yield yourselves up unto us, and unite with\r\nus and become acquainted with our secret works, and become our\r\nbrethren that ye may be like unto us--not our slaves, but our\r\nbrethren and partners of all our substance.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:8\r\n 8 And behold, I swear unto you, if ye will do this, with an\r\noath, ye shall not be destroyed; but if ye will not do this, I\r\nswear unto you with an oath, that on the morrow month I will\r\ncommand that my armies shall come down against you, and they\r\nshall not stay their hand and shall spare not, but shall slay\r\nyou, and shall let fall the sword upon you even until ye shall\r\nbecome extinct.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:9\r\n 9 And behold, I am Giddianhi; and I am the governor of this the\r\nsecret society of Gadianton; which society and the works thereof\r\nI know to be good; and they are of ancient date and they have\r\nbeen handed down unto us.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:10\r\n 10 And I write this epistle unto you, Lachoneus, and I hope that\r\nye will deliver up your lands and your possessions, without the\r\nshedding of blood, that this my people may recover their rights\r\nand government, who have dissented away from you because of your\r\nwickedness in retaining from them their rights of government, and\r\nexcept ye do this, I will avenge their wrongs. I am Giddianhi.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:11\r\n 11 And now it came to pass when Lachoneus received this epistle\r\nhe was exceedingly astonished, because of the boldness of\r\nGiddianhi demanding the possession of the land of the Nephites,\r\nand also of threatening the people and avenging the wrongs of\r\nthose that had received no wrong, save it were they had wronged\r\nthemselves by dissenting away unto those wicked and abominable\r\nrobbers.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:12\r\n 12 Now behold, this Lachoneus, the governor, was a just man, and\r\ncould not be frightened by the demands and the threatenings of a\r\nrobber; therefore he did not hearken to the epistle of Giddianhi,\r\nthe governor of the robbers, but he did cause that his people\r\nshould cry unto the Lord for strength against the time that the\r\nrobbers should come down against them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:13\r\n 13 Yea, he sent a proclamation among all the people, that they\r\nshould gather together their women, and their children, their\r\nflocks and their herds, and all their substance, save it were\r\ntheir land, unto one place.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:14\r\n 14 And he caused that fortifications should be built round about\r\nthem, and the strength thereof should be exceedingly great. And\r\nhe caused that armies, both of the Nephites and of the Lamanites,\r\nor of all them who were numbered among the Nephites, should be\r\nplaced as guards round about to watch them, and to guard them\r\nfrom the robbers day and night.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:15\r\n 15 Yea, he said unto them: As the Lord liveth, except ye repent\r\nof all your iniquities, and cry unto the Lord, ye will in no wise\r\nbe delivered out of the hands of those Gadianton robbers.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:16\r\n 16 And so great and marvelous were the words and prophecies of\r\nLachoneus that they did cause fear to come upon all the people;\r\nand they did exert themselves in their might to do according to\r\nthe words of Lachoneus.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:17\r\n 17 And it came to pass that Lachoneus did appoint chief captains\r\nover all the armies of the Nephites, to command them at the time\r\nthat the robbers should come down out of the wilderness against\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:18\r\n 18 Now the chiefest among all the chief captains and the great\r\ncommander of the armies of the Nephites was appointed, and his\r\nname was Gidgiddoni.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:19\r\n 19 Now it was the custom among all the Nephites to appoint for\r\ntheir chief captains, (save it were in their times of wickedness)\r\nsome one that had the spirit of revelation and also prophecy;\r\ntherefore, this Gidgiddoni was a great prophet among them, as\r\nalso was the chief judge.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:20\r\n 20 Now the people said unto Gidgiddoni: Pray unto the Lord, and\r\nlet us go up upon the mountains and into the wilderness, that we\r\nmay fall upon the robbers and destroy them in their own lands.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:21\r\n 21 But Gidgiddoni saith unto them: The Lord forbid; for if we\r\nshould go up against them the Lord would deliver us into their\r\nhands; therefore we will prepare ourselves in the center of our\r\nlands, and we will gather all our armies together, and we will\r\nnot go against them, but we will wait till they shall come\r\nagainst us; therefore as the Lord liveth, if we do this he will\r\ndeliver them into our hands.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:22\r\n 22 And it came to pass in the seventeenth year, in the latter\r\nend of the year, the proclamation of Lachoneus had gone forth\r\nthroughout all the face of the land, and they had taken their\r\nhorses, and their chariots, and their cattle, and all their\r\nflocks, and their herds, and their grain, and all their\r\nsubstance, and did march forth by thousands and by tens of\r\nthousands, until they had all gone forth to the place which had\r\nbeen appointed that they should gather themselves together, to\r\ndefend themselves against their enemies.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:23\r\n 23 And the land which was appointed was the land of Zarahemla,\r\nand the land which was between the land Zarahemla and the land\r\nBountiful, yea, to the line which was between the land Bountiful\r\nand the land Desolation.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:24\r\n 24 And there were a great many thousand people who were called\r\nNephites, who did gather themselves together in this land. Now\r\nLachoneus did cause that they should gather themselves together\r\nin the land southward, because of the great curse which was upon\r\nthe land northward.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:25\r\n 25 And they did fortify themselves against their enemies; and\r\nthey did dwell in one land, and in one body, and they did fear\r\nthe words which had been spoken by Lachoneus, insomuch that they\r\ndid repent of all their sins; and they did put up their prayers\r\nunto the Lord their God, that he would deliver them in the time\r\nthat their enemies should come down against them to battle.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 3:26\r\n 26 And they were exceedingly sorrowful because of their enemies.\r\nAnd Gidgiddoni did cause that they should make weapons of war of\r\nevery kind, and they should be strong with armor, and with\r\nshields, and with bucklers, after the manner of his instruction.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4\r\nChapter 4\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:1\r\n 1 And it came to pass that in the latter end of the eighteenth\r\nyear those armies of robbers had prepared for battle, and began\r\nto come down and to sally forth from the hills, and out of the\r\nmountains, and the wilderness, and their strongholds, and their\r\nsecret places, and began to take possession of the lands, both\r\nwhich were in the land south and which were in the land north,\r\nand began to take possession of all the lands which had been\r\ndeserted by the Nephites, and the cities which had been left\r\ndesolate.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:2\r\n 2 But behold, there were no wild beasts nor game in those lands\r\nwhich had been deserted by the Nephites, and there was no game\r\nfor the robbers save it were in the wilderness.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:3\r\n 3 And the robbers could not exist save it were in the\r\nwilderness, for the want of food; for the Nephites had left their\r\nlands desolate, and had gathered their flocks and their herds and\r\nall their substance, and they were in one body.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:4\r\n 4 Therefore, there was no chance for the robbers to plunder and\r\nto obtain food, save it were to come up in open battle against\r\nthe Nephites; and the Nephites being in one body, and having so\r\ngreat a number, and having reserved for themselves provisions,\r\nand horses and cattle, and flocks of every kind, that they might\r\nsubsist for the space of seven years, in the which time they did\r\nhope to destroy the robbers from off the face of the land; and\r\nthus the eighteenth year did pass away.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:5\r\n 5 And it came to pass that in the nineteenth year Giddianhi\r\nfound that it was expedient that he should go up to battle\r\nagainst the Nephites, for there was no way that they could\r\nsubsist save it were to plunder and rob and murder.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:6\r\n 6 And they durst not spread themselves upon the face of the land\r\ninsomuch that they could raise grain, lest the Nephites should\r\ncome upon them and slay them; therefore Giddianhi gave\r\ncommandment unto his armies that in this year they should go up\r\nto battle against the Nephites.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:7\r\n 7 And it came to pass that they did come up to battle; and it\r\nwas in the sixth month; and behold, great and terrible was the\r\nday that they did come up to battle; and they were girded about\r\nafter the manner of robbers; and they had a lamb-skin about their\r\nloins, and they were dyed in blood, and their heads were shorn,\r\nand they had head-plates upon them; and great and terrible was\r\nthe appearance of the armies of Giddianhi, because of their\r\narmor, and because of their being dyed in blood.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:8\r\n 8 And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites, when they\r\nsaw the appearance of the army of Giddianhi, had all fallen to\r\nthe earth, and did lift their cries to the Lord their God, that\r\nhe would spare them and deliver them out of the hands of their\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:9\r\n 9 And it came to pass that when the armies of Giddianhi saw this\r\nthey began to shout with a loud voice, because of their joy, for\r\nthey had supposed that the Nephites had fallen with fear because\r\nof the terror of their armies.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:10\r\n 10 But in this thing they were disappointed, for the Nephites\r\ndid not fear them; but they did fear their God and did supplicate\r\nhim for protection; therefore, when the armies of Giddianhi did\r\nrush upon them they were prepared to meet them; yea, in the\r\nstrength of the Lord they did receive them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:11\r\n 11 And the battle commenced in this the sixth month; and great\r\nand terrible was the battle thereof, yea, great and terrible was\r\nthe slaughter thereof, insomuch that there never was known so\r\ngreat a slaughter among all the people of Lehi since he left\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:12\r\n 12 And notwithstanding the threatenings and the oaths which\r\nGiddianhi had made, behold, the Nephites did beat them, insomuch\r\nthat they did fall back from before them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:13\r\n 13 And it came to pass that Gidgiddoni commanded that his armies\r\nshould pursue them as far as the borders of the wilderness, and\r\nthat they should not spare any that should fall into their hands\r\nby the way; and thus they did pursue them and did slay them, to\r\nthe borders of the wilderness, even until they had fulfilled the\r\ncommandment of Gidgiddoni.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:14\r\n 14 And it came to pass that Giddianhi, who had stood and fought\r\nwith boldness, was pursued as he fled; and being weary because of\r\nhis much fighting he was overtaken and slain. And thus was the\r\nend of Giddianhi the robber.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:15\r\n 15 And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites did\r\nreturn again to their place of security. And it came to pass\r\nthat this nineteenth year did pass away, and the robbers did not\r\ncome again to battle; neither did they come again in the\r\ntwentieth year.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:16\r\n 16 And in the twenty and first year they did not come up to\r\nbattle, but they came up on all sides to lay siege round about\r\nthe people of Nephi; for they did suppose that if they should cut\r\noff the people of Nephi from their lands, and should hem them in\r\non every side, and if they should cut them off from all their\r\noutward privileges, that they could cause them to yield\r\nthemselves up according to their wishes.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:17\r\n 17 Now they had appointed unto themselves another leader, whose\r\nname was Zemnarihah; therefore it was Zemnarihah that did cause\r\nthat this siege should take place.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:18\r\n 18 But behold, this was an advantage to the Nephites; for it was\r\nimpossible for the robbers to lay siege sufficiently long to have\r\nany effect upon the Nephites, because of their much provision\r\nwhich they had laid up in store,\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:19\r\n 19 And because of the scantiness of provisions among the\r\nrobbers--for behold, they had nothing save it were meat for their\r\nsubsistence, which meat they did obtain in the wilderness;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:20\r\n 20 And it came to pass that the wild game became scarce in the\r\nwilderness--insomuch that the robbers were about to perish with\r\nhunger.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:21\r\n 21 And the Nephites were continually marching out by day and by\r\nnight, and falling upon their armies, and cutting them off by\r\nthousands and by tens of thousands.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:22\r\n 22 And thus it became the desire of the people of Zemnarihah to\r\nwithdraw from their design, because of the great destruction\r\nwhich came upon them by night and by day.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:23\r\n 23 And it came to pass that Zemnarihah did give command unto his\r\npeople that they should withdraw themselves from the siege, and\r\nmarch into the furthermost parts of the land northward.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:24\r\n 24 And now, Gidgiddoni being aware of their design, and knowing\r\nof their weakness because of the want of food, and the great\r\nslaughter which had been made among them, therefore he did send\r\nout his armies in the night-time, and did cut off the way of\r\ntheir retreat, and did place his armies in the way of their\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:25\r\n 25 And this did they do in the night-time, and got on their\r\nmarch beyond the robbers, so that on the morrow, when the robbers\r\nbegan their march, they were met by the armies of the Nephites\r\nboth in their front and in their rear.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:26\r\n 26 And the robbers who were on the south were also cut off in\r\ntheir places of retreat. And all these things were done by\r\ncommand of Gidgiddoni.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:27\r\n 27 And there were many thousands who did yield themselves up\r\nprisoners unto the Nephites, and the remainder of them were\r\nslain.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:28\r\n 28 And their leader, Zemnarihah, was taken and hanged upon a\r\ntree, yea, even upon the top thereof until he was dead. And when\r\nthey had hanged him until he was dead they did fell the tree to\r\nthe earth, and did cry with a loud voice, saying:\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:29\r\n 29 May the Lord preserve his people in righteousness and in\r\nholiness of heart, that they may cause to be felled to the earth\r\nall who shall seek to slay them because of power and secret\r\ncombinations, even as this man hath been felled to the earth.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:30\r\n 30 And they did rejoice and cry again with one voice, saying:\r\nMay the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of\r\nJacob, protect this people in righteousness, so long as they\r\nshall call on the name of their God for protection.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:31\r\n 31 And it came to pass that they did break forth, all as one, in\r\nsinging, and praising their God for the great thing which he had\r\ndone for them, in preserving them from falling into the hands of\r\ntheir enemies.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:32\r\n 32 Yea, they did cry: Hosanna to the Most High God. And they\r\ndid cry: Blessed be the name of the Lord God Almighty, the Most\r\nHigh God.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 4:33\r\n 33 And their hearts were swollen with joy, unto the gushing out\r\nof many tears, because of the great goodness of God in delivering\r\nthem out of the hands of their enemies; and they knew it was\r\nbecause of their repentance and their humility that they had been\r\ndelivered from an everlasting destruction.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5\r\nChapter 5\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:1\r\n 1 And now behold, there was not a living soul among all the\r\npeople of the Nephites who did doubt in the least the words of\r\nall the holy prophets who had spoken; for they knew that it must\r\nneeds be that they must be fulfilled.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:2\r\n 2 And they knew that it must be expedient that Christ had come,\r\nbecause of the many signs which had been given, according to the\r\nwords of the prophets; and because of the things which had come\r\nto pass already they knew that it must needs be that all things\r\nshould come to pass according to that which had been spoken.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:3\r\n 3 Therefore they did forsake all their sins, and their\r\nabominations, and their whoredoms, and did serve God with all\r\ndiligence day and night.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:4\r\n 4 And now it came to pass that when they had taken all the\r\nrobbers prisoners, insomuch that none did escape who were not\r\nslain, they did cast their prisoners into prison, and did cause\r\nthe word of God to be preached unto them; and as many as would\r\nrepent of their sins and enter into a covenant that they would\r\nmurder no more were set at liberty.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:5\r\n 5 But as many as there were who did not enter into a covenant,\r\nand who did still continue to have those secret murders in their\r\nhearts, yea, as many as were found breathing out threatenings\r\nagainst their brethren were condemned and punished according to\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:6\r\n 6 And thus they did put an end to all those wicked, and secret,\r\nand abominable combinations, in the which there was so much\r\nwickedness, and so many murders committed.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:7\r\n 7 And thus had the twenty and second year passed away, and the\r\ntwenty and third year also, and the twenty and fourth, and the\r\ntwenty and fifth; and thus had twenty and five years passed away.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:8\r\n 8 And there had many things transpired which, in the eyes of\r\nsome, would be great and marvelous; nevertheless, they cannot all\r\nbe written in this book; yea, this book cannot contain even a\r\nhundredth part of what was done among so many people in the space\r\nof twenty and five years;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:9\r\n 9 But behold there are records which do contain all the\r\nproceedings of this people; and a shorter but true account was\r\ngiven by Nephi.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:10\r\n 10 Therefore I have made my record of these things according to\r\nthe record of Nephi, which was engraven on the plates which were\r\ncalled the plates of Nephi.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:11\r\n 11 And behold, I do make the record on plates which I have made\r\nwith mine own hands.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:12\r\n 12 And behold, I am called Mormon, being called after the land\r\nof Mormon, the land in which Alma did establish the church among\r\nthe people, yea, the first church which was established among\r\nthem after their transgression.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:13\r\n 13 Behold, I am a disciple of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I\r\nhave been called of him to declare his word among his people,\r\nthat they might have everlasting life.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:14\r\n 14 And it hath become expedient that I, according to the will of\r\nGod, that the prayers of those who have gone hence, who were the\r\nholy ones, should be fulfilled according to their faith, should\r\nmake a record of these things which have been done--\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:15\r\n 15 Yea, a small record of that which hath taken place from the\r\ntime that Lehi left Jerusalem, even down until the present time.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:16\r\n 16 Therefore I do make my record from the accounts which have\r\nbeen given by those who were before me, until the commencement of\r\nmy day;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:17\r\n 17 And then I do make a record of the things which I have seen\r\nwith mine own eyes.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:18\r\n 18 And I know the record which I make to be a just and a true\r\nrecord; nevertheless there are many things which, according to\r\nour language, we are not able to write.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:19\r\n 19 And now I make an end of my saying, which is of myself, and\r\nproceed to give my account of the things which have been before\r\nme.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:20\r\n 20 I am Mormon, and a pure descendant of Lehi. I have reason to\r\nbless my God and my Savior Jesus Christ, that he brought our\r\nfathers out of the land of Jerusalem, (and no one knew it save it\r\nwere himself and those whom he brought out of that land) and that\r\nhe hath given me and my people so much knowledge unto the\r\nsalvation of our souls.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:21\r\n 21 Surely he hath blessed the house of Jacob, and hath been\r\nmerciful unto the seed of Joseph.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:22\r\n 22 And insomuch as the children of Lehi have kept his\r\ncommandments he hath blessed them and prospered them according to\r\nhis word.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:23\r\n 23 Yea, and surely shall he again bring a remnant of the seed of\r\nJoseph to the knowledge of the Lord their God.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:24\r\n 24 And as surely as the Lord liveth, will he gather in from the\r\nfour quarters of the earth all the remnant of the seed of Jacob,\r\nwho are scattered abroad upon all the face of the earth.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:25\r\n 25 And as he hath covenanted with all the house of Jacob, even\r\nso shall the covenant wherewith he hath covenanted with the house\r\nof Jacob be fulfilled in his own due time, unto the restoring all\r\nthe house of Jacob unto the knowledge of the covenant that he\r\nhath covenanted with them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 5:26\r\n 26 And then shall they know their Redeemer, who is Jesus Christ,\r\nthe Son of God; and then shall they be gathered in from the four\r\nquarters of the earth unto their own lands, from whence they have\r\nbeen dispersed; yea, as the Lord liveth so shall it be. Amen.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6\r\nChapter 6\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:1\r\n 1 And now it came to pass that the people of the Nephites did\r\nall return to their own lands in the twenty and sixth year, every\r\nman, with his family, his flocks and his herds, his horses and\r\nhis cattle, and all things whatsoever did belong unto them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:2\r\n 2 And it came to pass that they had not eaten up all their\r\nprovisions; therefore they did take with them all that they had\r\nnot devoured, of all their grain of every kind, and their gold,\r\nand their silver, and all their precious things, and they did\r\nreturn to their own lands and their possessions, both on the\r\nnorth and on the south, both on the land northward and on the\r\nland southward.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:3\r\n 3 And they granted unto those robbers who had entered into a\r\ncovenant to keep the peace of the land, who were desirous to\r\nremain Lamanites, lands, according to their numbers, that they\r\nmight have, with their labors, wherewith to subsist upon; and\r\nthus they did establish peace in all the land.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:4\r\n 4 And they began again to prosper and to wax great; and the\r\ntwenty and sixth and seventh years passed away, and there was\r\ngreat order in the land; and they had formed their laws according\r\nto equity and justice.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:5\r\n 5 And now there was nothing in all the land to hinder the people\r\nfrom prospering continually, except they should fall into\r\ntransgression.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:6\r\n 6 And now it was Gidgiddoni, and the judge, Lachoneus, and those\r\nwho had been appointed leaders, who had established this great\r\npeace in the land.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:7\r\n 7 And it came to pass that there were many cities built anew,\r\nand there were many old cities repaired.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:8\r\n 8 And there were many highways cast up, and many roads made,\r\nwhich led from city to city, and from land to land, and from\r\nplace to place.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:9\r\n 9 And thus passed away the twenty and eighth year, and the\r\npeople had continual peace.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:10\r\n 10 But it came to pass in the twenty and ninth year there began\r\nto be some disputings among the people; and some were lifted up\r\nunto pride and boastings because of their exceedingly great\r\nriches, yea, even unto great persecutions;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:11\r\n 11 For there were many merchants in the land, and also many\r\nlawyers, and many officers.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:12\r\n 12 And the people began to be distinguished by ranks, according\r\nto their riches and their chances for learning, yea, some were\r\nignorant because of their poverty, and others did receive great\r\nlearning because of their riches.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:13\r\n 13 Some were lifted up in pride, and others were exceedingly\r\nhumble; some did return railing for railing, while others would\r\nreceive railing and persecution and all manner of afflictions,\r\nand would not turn and revile again, but were humble and penitent\r\nbefore God.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:14\r\n 14 And thus there became a great inequality in all the land,\r\ninsomuch that the church began to be broken up; yea, insomuch\r\nthat in the thirtieth year the church was broken up in all the\r\nland save it were among a few of the Lamanites who were converted\r\nunto the true faith; and they would not depart from it, for they\r\nwere firm, and steadfast, and immovable, willing with all\r\ndiligence to keep the commandments of the Lord.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:15\r\n 15 Now the cause of this iniquity of the people was this--Satan\r\nhad great power, unto the stirring up of the people to do all\r\nmanner of iniquity, and to the puffing them up with pride,\r\ntempting them to seek for power, and authority, and riches, and\r\nthe vain things of the world.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:16\r\n 16 And thus Satan did lead away the hearts of the people to do\r\nall manner of iniquity; therefore they had enjoyed peace but a\r\nfew years.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:17\r\n 17 And thus, in the commencement of the thirtieth year--the\r\npeople having been delivered up for the space of a long time to\r\nbe carried about by the temptations of the devil whithersoever he\r\ndesired to carry them, and to do whatsoever iniquity he desired\r\nthey should--and thus in the commencement of this, the thirtieth\r\nyear, they were in a state of awful wickedness.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:18\r\n 18 Now they did not sin ignorantly, for they knew the will of\r\nGod concerning them, for it had been taught unto them; therefore\r\nthey did wilfully rebel against God.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:19\r\n 19 And now it was in the days of Lachoneus, the son of\r\nLachoneus, for Lachoneus did fill the seat of his father and did\r\ngovern the people that year.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:20\r\n 20 And there began to be men inspired from heaven and sent\r\nforth, standing among the people in all the land, preaching and\r\ntestifying boldly of the sins and iniquities of the people, and\r\ntestifying unto them concerning the redemption which the Lord\r\nwould make for his people, or in other words, the resurrection of\r\nChrist; and they did testify boldly of his death and sufferings.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:21\r\n 21 Now there were many of the people who were exceedingly angry\r\nbecause of those who testified of these things; and those who\r\nwere angry were chiefly the chief judges, and they who had been\r\nhigh priests and lawyers; yea, all those who were lawyers were\r\nangry with those who testified of these things.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:22\r\n 22 Now there was no lawyer nor judge nor high priest that could\r\nhave power to condemn any one to death save their condemnation\r\nwas signed by the governor of the land.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:23\r\n 23 Now there were many of those who testified of the things\r\npertaining to Christ who testified boldly, who were taken and put\r\nto death secretly by the judges, that the knowledge of their\r\ndeath came not unto the governor of the land until after their\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:24\r\n 24 Now behold, this was contrary to the laws of the land, that\r\nany man should be put to death except they had power from the\r\ngovernor of the land--\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:25\r\n 25 Therefore a complaint came up unto the land of Zarahemla, to\r\nthe governor of the land, against these judges who had condemned\r\nthe prophets of the Lord unto death, not according to the law.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:26\r\n 26 Now it came to pass that they were taken and brought up\r\nbefore the judge to be judged of the crime which they had done,\r\naccording to the law which had been given by the people.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:27\r\n 27 Now it came to pass that those judges had many friends and\r\nkindreds; and the remainder, yea, even almost all the lawyers and\r\nthe high priests, did gather themselves together, and unite with\r\nthe kindreds of those judges who were to be tried according to\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:28\r\n 28 And they did enter into a covenant one with another, yea,\r\neven into that covenant which was given by them of old, which\r\ncovenant was given and administered by the devil, to combine\r\nagainst all righteousness.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:29\r\n 29 Therefore they did combine against the people of the Lord,\r\nand enter into a covenant to destroy them, and to deliver those\r\nwho were guilty of murder from the grasp of justice, which was\r\nabout to be administered according to the law.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 6:30\r\n 30 And they did set at defiance the law and the rights of their\r\ncountry; and they did covenant one with another to destroy the\r\ngovernor, and to establish a king over the land, that the land\r\nshould no more be at liberty but should be subject unto kings.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:1\r\n 1 Now behold, I will show unto you that they did not establish a\r\nking over the land; but in this same year, yea, the thirtieth\r\nyear, they did destroy upon the judgment seat, yea, did murder\r\nthe chief judge of the land.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:2\r\n 2 And the people were divided one against another; and they did\r\nseparate one from another into tribes, every man according to his\r\nfamily and his kindred and friends; and thus they did destroy the\r\ngovernment of the land.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:3\r\n 3 And every tribe did appoint a chief or a leader over them; and\r\nthus they became tribes and leaders of tribes.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:4\r\n 4 Now behold, there was no man among them save he had much\r\nfamily and many kindreds and friends; therefore their tribes\r\nbecame exceedingly great.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:5\r\n 5 Now all this was done, and there were no wars as yet among\r\nthem; and all this iniquity had come upon the people because they\r\ndid yield themselves unto the power of Satan.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:6\r\n 6 And the regulations of the government were destroyed, because\r\nof the secret combination of the friends and kindreds of those\r\nwho murdered the prophets.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:7\r\n 7 And they did cause a great contention in the land, insomuch\r\nthat the more righteous part of the people had nearly all become\r\nwicked; yea, there were but few righteous men among them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:8\r\n 8 And thus six years had not passed away since the more part of\r\nthe people had turned from their righteousness, like the dog to\r\nhis vomit, or like the sow to her wallowing in the mire.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:9\r\n 9 Now this secret combination, which had brought so great\r\niniquity upon the people, did gather themselves together, and did\r\nplace at their head a man whom they did call Jacob;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:10\r\n 10 And they did call him their king; therefore he became a king\r\nover this wicked band; and he was one of the chiefest who had\r\ngiven his voice against the prophets who testified of Jesus.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:11\r\n 11 And it came to pass that they were not so strong in number as\r\nthe tribes of the people, who were united together save it were\r\ntheir leaders did establish their laws, every one according to\r\nhis tribe; nevertheless they were enemies; notwithstanding they\r\nwere not a righteous people, yet they were united in the hatred\r\nof those who had entered into a covenant to destroy the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:12\r\n 12 Therefore, Jacob seeing that their enemies were more numerous\r\nthan they, he being the king of the band, therefore he commanded\r\nhis people that they should take their flight into the\r\nnorthernmost part of the land, and there build up unto themselves\r\na kingdom, until they were joined by dissenters, (for he\r\nflattered them that there would be many dissenters) and they\r\nbecome sufficiently strong to contend with the tribes of the\r\npeople; and they did so.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:13\r\n 13 And so speedy was their march that it could not be impeded\r\nuntil they had gone forth out of the reach of the people. And\r\nthus ended the thirtieth year; and thus were the affairs of the\r\npeople of Nephi.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:14\r\n 14 And it came to pass in the thirty and first year that they\r\nwere divided into tribes, every man according to his family,\r\nkindred and friends; nevertheless they had come to an agreement\r\nthat they would not go to war one with another; but they were not\r\nunited as to their laws, and their manner of government, for they\r\nwere established according to the minds of those who were their\r\nchiefs and their leaders. But they did establish very strict\r\nlaws that one tribe should not trespass against another, insomuch\r\nthat in some degree they had peace in the land; nevertheless,\r\ntheir hearts were turned from the Lord their God, and they did\r\nstone the prophets and did cast them out from among them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:15\r\n 15 And it came to pass that Nephi--having been visited by angels\r\nand also the voice of the Lord, therefore having seen angels, and\r\nbeing eye-witness, and having had power given unto him that he\r\nmight know concerning the ministry of Christ, and also being\r\neye-witness to their quick return from righteousness unto their\r\nwickedness and abominations;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:16\r\n 16 Therefore, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts and\r\nthe blindness of their minds--went forth among them in that same\r\nyear, and began to testify, boldly, repentance and remission of\r\nsins through faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:17\r\n 17 And he did minister many things unto them; and all of them\r\ncannot be written, and a part of them would not suffice,\r\ntherefore they are not written in this book. And Nephi did\r\nminister with power and with great authority.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:18\r\n 18 And it came to pass that they were angry with him, even\r\nbecause he had greater power than they, for it were not possible\r\nthat they could disbelieve his words, for so great was his faith\r\non the Lord Jesus Christ that angels did minister unto him daily.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:19\r\n 19 And in the name of Jesus did he cast out devils and unclean\r\nspirits; and even his brother did he raise from the dead, after\r\nhe had been stoned and suffered death by the people.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:20\r\n 20 And the people saw it, and did witness of it, and were angry\r\nwith him because of his power; and he did also do many more\r\nmiracles, in the sight of the people, in the name of Jesus.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:21\r\n 21 And it came to pass that the thirty and first year did pass\r\naway, and there were but few who were converted unto the Lord;\r\nbut as many as were converted did truly signify unto the people\r\nthat they had been visited by the power and Spirit of God, which\r\nwas in Jesus Christ, in whom they believed.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:22\r\n 22 And as many as had devils cast out from them, and were healed\r\nof their sicknesses and their infirmities, did truly manifest\r\nunto the people that they had been wrought upon by the Spirit of\r\nGod, and had been healed; and they did show forth signs also and\r\ndid do some miracles among the people.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:23\r\n 23 Thus passed away the thirty and second year also. And Nephi\r\ndid cry unto the people in the commencement of the thirty and\r\nthird year; and he did preach unto them repentance and remission\r\nof sins.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:24\r\n 24 Now I would have you to remember also, that there were none\r\nwho were brought unto repentance who were not baptized with\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:25\r\n 25 Therefore, there were ordained of Nephi, men unto this\r\nministry, that all such as should come unto them should be\r\nbaptized with water, and this as a witness and a testimony before\r\nGod, and unto the people, that they had repented and received a\r\nremission of their sins.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 7:26\r\n 26 And there were many in the commencement of this year that\r\nwere baptized unto repentance; and thus the more part of the year\r\ndid pass away.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8\r\nChapter 8\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8:1\r\n 1 And now it came to pass that according to our record, and we\r\nknow our record to be true, for behold, it was a just man who did\r\nkeep the record--for he truly did many miracles in the name of\r\nJesus; and there was not any man who could do a miracle in the\r\nname of Jesus save he were cleansed every whit from his\r\niniquity--\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8:2\r\n 2 And now it came to pass, if there was no mistake made by this\r\nman in the reckoning of our time, the thirty and third year had\r\npassed away;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8:3\r\n 3 And the people began to look with great earnestness for the\r\nsign which had been given by the prophet Samuel, the Lamanite,\r\nyea, for the time that there should be darkness for the space of\r\nthree days over the face of the land.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8:4\r\n 4 And there began to be great doubtings and disputations among\r\nthe people, notwithstanding so many signs had been given.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8:5\r\n 5 And it came to pass in the thirty and fourth year, in the\r\nfirst month, on the fourth day of the month, there arose a great\r\nstorm, such an one as never had been known in all the land.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8:6\r\n 6 And there was also a great and terrible tempest; and there was\r\nterrible thunder, insomuch that it did shake the whole earth as\r\nif it was about to divide asunder.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8:7\r\n 7 And there were exceedingly sharp lightnings, such as never had\r\nbeen known in all the land.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8:8\r\n 8 And the city of Zarahemla did take fire.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8:9\r\n 9 And the city of Moroni did sink into the depths of the sea,\r\nand the inhabitants thereof were drowned.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8:10\r\n 10 And the earth was carried up upon the city of Moronihah that\r\nin the place of the city there became a great mountain.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8:11\r\n 11 And there was a great and terrible destruction in the land\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8:12\r\n 12 But behold, there was a more great and terrible destruction\r\nin the land northward; for behold, the whole face of the land was\r\nchanged, because of the tempest and the whirlwinds and the\r\nthunderings and the lightnings, and the exceedingly great quaking\r\nof the whole earth;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8:13\r\n 13 And the highways were broken up, and the level roads were\r\nspoiled, and many smooth places became rough.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8:14\r\n 14 And many great and notable cities were sunk, and many were\r\nburned, and many were shaken till the buildings thereof had\r\nfallen to the earth, and the inhabitants thereof were slain, and\r\nthe places were left desolate.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8:15\r\n 15 And there were some cities which remained; but the damage\r\nthereof was exceedingly great, and there were many of them who\r\nwere slain.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8:16\r\n 16 And there were some who were carried away in the whirlwind;\r\nand whither they went no man knoweth, save they know that they\r\nwere carried away.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8:17\r\n 17 And thus the face of the whole earth became deformed, because\r\nof the tempests, and the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the\r\nquaking of the earth.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8:18\r\n 18 And behold, the rocks were rent in twain; they were broken up\r\nupon the face of the whole earth, insomuch that they were found\r\nin broken fragments, and in seams and in cracks, upon all the\r\nface of the land.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8:19\r\n 19 And it came to pass that when the thunderings, and the\r\nlightnings, and the storm, and the tempest, and the quakings of\r\nthe earth did cease--for behold, they did last for about the\r\nspace of three hours; and it was said by some that the time was\r\ngreater; nevertheless, all these great and terrible things were\r\ndone in about the space of three hours--and then behold, there\r\nwas darkness upon the face of the land.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8:20\r\n 20 And it came to pass that there was thick darkness upon all\r\nthe face of the land, insomuch that the inhabitants thereof who\r\nhad not fallen could feel the vapor of darkness;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8:21\r\n 21 And there could be no light, because of the darkness, neither\r\ncandles, neither torches; neither could there be fire kindled\r\nwith their fine and exceedingly dry wood, so that there could not\r\nbe any light at all;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8:22\r\n 22 And there was not any light seen, neither fire, nor glimmer,\r\nneither the sun, nor the moon, nor the stars, for so great were\r\nthe mists of darkness which were upon the face of the land.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8:23\r\n 23 And it came to pass that it did last for the space of three\r\ndays that there was no light seen; and there was great mourning\r\nand howling and weeping among all the people continually; yea,\r\ngreat were the groanings of the people, because of the darkness\r\nand the great destruction which had come upon them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8:24\r\n 24 And in one place they were heard to cry, saying: O that we\r\nhad repented before this great and terrible day, and then would\r\nour brethren have been spared, and they would not have been\r\nburned in that great city Zarahemla.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 8:25\r\n 25 And in another place they were heard to cry and mourn,\r\nsaying: O that we had repented before this great and terrible\r\nday, and had not killed and stoned the prophets, and cast them\r\nout; then would our mothers and our fair daughters, and our\r\nchildren have been spared, and not have been buried up in that\r\ngreat city Moronihah. And thus were the howlings of the people\r\ngreat and terrible.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 9\r\nChapter 9\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 9:1\r\n 1 And it came to pass that there was a voice heard among all the\r\ninhabitants of the earth, upon all the face of this land, crying:\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 9:2\r\n 2 Wo, wo, wo unto this people; wo unto the inhabitants of the\r\nwhole earth except they shall repent; for the devil laugheth, and\r\nhis angels rejoice, because of the slain of the fair sons and\r\ndaughters of my people; and it is because of their iniquity and\r\nabominations that they are fallen!\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 9:3\r\n 3 Behold, that great city Zarahemla have I burned with fire, and\r\nthe inhabitants thereof.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 9:4\r\n 4 And behold, that great city Moroni have I caused to be sunk in\r\nthe depths of the sea, and the inhabitants thereof to be drowned.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 9:5\r\n 5 And behold, that great city Moronihah have I covered with\r\nearth, and the inhabitants thereof, to hide their iniquities and\r\ntheir abominations from before my face, that the blood of the\r\nprophets and the saints shall not come any more unto me against\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 9:6\r\n 6 And behold, the city of Gilgal have I caused to be sunk, and\r\nthe inhabitants thereof to be buried up in the depths of the\r\nearth;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 9:7\r\n 7 Yea, and the city of Onihah and the inhabitants thereof, and\r\nthe city of Mocum and the inhabitants thereof, and the city of\r\nJerusalem and the inhabitants thereof; and waters have I caused\r\nto come up in the stead thereof, to hide their wickedness and\r\nabominations from before my face, that the blood of the prophets\r\nand the saints shall not come up any more unto me against them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 9:8\r\n 8 And behold, the city of Gadiandi, and the city of Gadiomnah,\r\nand the city of Jacob, and the city of Gimgimno, all these have I\r\ncaused to be sunk, and made hills and valleys in the places\r\nthereof; and the inhabitants thereof have I buried up in the\r\ndepths of the earth, to hide their wickedness and abominations\r\nfrom before my face, that the blood of the prophets and the\r\nsaints should not come up any more unto me against them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 9:9\r\n 9 And behold, that great city Jacobugath, which was inhabited by\r\nthe people of king Jacob, have I caused to be burned with fire\r\nbecause of their sins and their wickedness, which was above all\r\nthe wickedness of the whole earth, because of their secret\r\nmurders and combinations; for it was they that did destroy the\r\npeace of my people and the government of the land; therefore I\r\ndid cause them to be burned, to destroy them from before my face,\r\nthat the blood of the prophets and the saints should not come up\r\nunto me any more against them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 9:10\r\n 10 And behold, the city of Laman, and the city of Josh, and the\r\ncity of Gad, and the city of Kishkumen, have I caused to be\r\nburned with fire, and the inhabitants thereof, because of their\r\nwickedness in casting out the prophets, and stoning those whom I\r\ndid send to declare unto them concerning their wickedness and\r\ntheir abominations.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 9:11\r\n 11 And because they did cast them all out, that there were none\r\nrighteous among them, I did send down fire and destroy them, that\r\ntheir wickedness and abominations might be hid from before my\r\nface, that the blood of the prophets and the saints whom I sent\r\namong them might not cry unto me from the ground against them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 9:12\r\n 12 And many great destructions have I caused to come upon this\r\nland, and upon this people, because of their wickedness and their\r\nabominations.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 9:13\r\n 13 O all ye that are spared because ye were more righteous than\r\nthey, will ye not now return unto me, and repent of your sins,\r\nand be converted, that I may heal you?\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 9:14\r\n 14 Yea, verily I say unto you, if ye will come unto me ye shall\r\nhave eternal life. Behold, mine arm of mercy is extended towards\r\nyou, and whosoever will come, him will I receive; and blessed are\r\nthose who come unto me.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 9:15\r\n 15 Behold, I am Jesus Christ the Son of God. I created the\r\nheavens and the earth, and all things that in them are. I was\r\nwith the Father from the beginning. I am in the Father, and the\r\nFather in me; and in me hath the Father glorified his name.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 9:16\r\n 16 I came unto my own, and my own received me not. And the\r\nscriptures concerning my coming are fulfilled.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 9:17\r\n 17 And as many as have received me, to them have I given to\r\nbecome the sons of God; and even so will I to as many as shall\r\nbelieve on my name, for behold, by me redemption cometh, and in\r\nme is the law of Moses fulfilled.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 9:18\r\n 18 I am the light and the life of the world. I am Alpha and\r\nOmega, the beginning and the end.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 9:19\r\n 19 And ye shall offer up unto me no more the shedding of blood;\r\nyea, your sacrifices and your burnt offerings shall be done away,\r\nfor I will accept none of your sacrifices and your burnt\r\nofferings.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 9:20\r\n 20 And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and\r\na contrite spirit. And whoso cometh unto me with a broken heart\r\nand a contrite spirit, him will I baptize with fire and with the\r\nHoly Ghost, even as the Lamanites, because of their faith in me\r\nat the time of their conversion, were baptized with fire and with\r\nthe Holy Ghost, and they knew it not.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 9:21\r\n 21 Behold, I have come unto the world to bring redemption unto\r\nthe world, to save the world from sin.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 9:22\r\n 22 Therefore, whoso repenteth and cometh unto me as a little\r\nchild, him will I receive, for of such is the kingdom of God.\r\nBehold, for such I have laid down my life, and have taken it up\r\nagain; therefore repent, and come unto me ye ends of the earth,\r\nand be saved.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 10\r\nChapter 10\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 10:1\r\n 1 And now behold, it came to pass that all the people of the\r\nland did hear these sayings, and did witness of it. And after\r\nthese sayings there was silence in the land for the space of many\r\nhours;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 10:2\r\n 2 For so great was the astonishment of the people that they did\r\ncease lamenting and howling for the loss of their kindred which\r\nhad been slain; therefore there was silence in all the land for\r\nthe space of many hours.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 10:3\r\n 3 And it came to pass that there came a voice again unto the\r\npeople, and all the people did hear, and did witness of it,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 10:4\r\n 4 O ye people of these great cities which have fallen, who are\r\ndescendants of Jacob, yea, who are of the house of Israel, how\r\noft have I gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her\r\nwings, and have nourished you.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 10:5\r\n 5 And again, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen\r\ngathereth her chickens under her wings, yea, O ye people of the\r\nhouse of Israel, who have fallen; yea, O ye people of the house\r\nof Israel, ye that dwell at Jerusalem, as ye that have fallen;\r\nyea, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her\r\nchickens, and ye would not.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 10:6\r\n 6 O ye house of Israel whom I have spared, how oft will I gather\r\nyou as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, if ye will\r\nrepent and return unto me with full purpose of heart.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 10:7\r\n 7 But if not, O house of Israel, the places of your dwellings\r\nshall become desolate until the time of the fulfilling of the\r\ncovenant to your fathers.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 10:8\r\n 8 And now it came to pass that after the people had heard these\r\nwords, behold, they began to weep and howl again because of the\r\nloss of their kindred and friends.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 10:9\r\n 9 And it came to pass that thus did the three days pass away.\r\nAnd it was in the morning, and the darkness dispersed from off\r\nthe face of the land, and the earth did cease to tremble, and the\r\nrocks did cease to rend, and the dreadful groanings did cease,\r\nand all the tumultuous noises did pass away.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 10:10\r\n 10 And the earth did cleave together again, that it stood; and\r\nthe mourning, and the weeping, and the wailing of the people who\r\nwere spared alive did cease; and their mourning was turned into\r\njoy, and their lamentations into the praise and thanksgiving unto\r\nthe Lord Jesus Christ, their Redeemer.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 10:11\r\n 11 And thus far were the scriptures fulfilled which had been\r\nspoken by the prophets.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 10:12\r\n 12 And it was the more righteous part of the people who were\r\nsaved, and it was they who received the prophets and stoned them\r\nnot; and it was they who had not shed the blood of the saints,\r\nwho were spared--\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 10:13\r\n 13 And they were spared and were not sunk and buried up in the\r\nearth; and they were not drowned in the depths of the sea; and\r\nthey were not burned by fire, neither were they fallen upon and\r\ncrushed to death; and they were not carried away in the\r\nwhirlwind; neither were they overpowered by the vapor of smoke\r\nand of darkness.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 10:14\r\n 14 And now, whoso readeth, let him understand; he that hath the\r\nscriptures, let him search them, and see and behold if all these\r\ndeaths and destructions by fire, and by smoke, and by tempests,\r\nand by whirlwinds, and by the opening of the earth to receive\r\nthem, and all these things are not unto the fulfilling of the\r\nprophecies of many of the holy prophets.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 10:15\r\n 15 Behold, I say unto you, Yea, many have testified of these\r\nthings at the coming of Christ, and were slain because they\r\ntestified of these things.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 10:16\r\n 16 Yea, the prophet Zenos did testify of these things, and also\r\nZenock spake concerning these things, because they testified\r\nparticularly concerning us, who are the remnant of their seed.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 10:17\r\n 17 Behold, our father Jacob also testified concerning a remnant\r\nof the seed of Joseph. And behold, are not we a remnant of the\r\nseed of Joseph? And these things which testify of us, are they\r\nnot written upon the plates of brass which our father Lehi\r\nbrought out of Jerusalem?\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 10:18\r\n 18 And it came to pass that in the ending of the thirty and\r\nfourth year, behold, I will show unto you that the people of\r\nNephi who were spared, and also those who had been called\r\nLamanites, who had been spared, did have great favors shown unto\r\nthem, and great blessings poured out upon their heads, insomuch\r\nthat soon after the ascension of Christ into heaven he did truly\r\nmanifest himself unto them--\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 10:19\r\n 19 Showing his body unto them, and ministering unto them; and an\r\naccount of his ministry shall be given hereafter. Therefore for\r\nthis time I make an end of my sayings.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11\r\nChapter 11\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:1\r\n 1 And now it came to pass that there were a great multitude\r\ngathered together, of the people of Nephi, round about the temple\r\nwhich was in the land Bountiful; and they were marveling and\r\nwondering one with another, and were showing one to another the\r\ngreat and marvelous change which had taken place.\r\n3 Nephi 11:2\r\n 2 And they were also conversing about this Jesus Christ, of whom\r\nthe sign had been given concerning his death.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:3\r\n 3 And it came to pass that while they were thus conversing one\r\nwith another, they heard a voice as if it came out of heaven; and\r\nthey cast their eyes round about, for they understood not the\r\nvoice which they heard; and it was not a harsh voice, neither was\r\nit a loud voice; nevertheless, and notwithstanding it being a\r\nsmall voice it did pierce them that did hear to the center,\r\ninsomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not\r\ncause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did\r\ncause their hearts to burn.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:4\r\n 4 And it came to pass that again they heard the voice, and they\r\nunderstood it not.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:5\r\n 5 And again the third time they did hear the voice, and did open\r\ntheir ears to hear it; and their eyes were towards the sound\r\nthereof; and they did look steadfastly towards heaven, from\r\nwhence the sound came.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:6\r\n 6 And behold, the third time they did understand the voice which\r\nthey heard; and it said unto them:\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:7\r\n 7 Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I\r\nhave glorified my name--hear ye him.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:8\r\n 8 And it came to pass, as they understood they cast their eyes\r\nup again towards heaven; and behold, they saw a Man descending\r\nout of heaven; and he was clothed in a white robe; and he came\r\ndown and stood in the midst of them; and the eyes of the whole\r\nmultitude were turned upon him, and they durst not open their\r\nmouths, even one to another, and wist not what it meant, for they\r\nthought it was an angel that had appeared unto them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:9\r\n 9 And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake\r\nunto the people, saying:\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:10\r\n 10 Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall\r\ncome into the world.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:11\r\n 11 And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I\r\nhave drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me,\r\nand have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the\r\nworld, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all\r\nthings from the beginning.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:12\r\n 12 And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words\r\nthe whole multitude fell to the earth; for they remembered that\r\nit had been prophesied among them that Christ should show himself\r\nunto them after his ascension into heaven.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:13\r\n 13 And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto them saying:\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:14\r\n 14 Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands\r\ninto my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails\r\nin my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of\r\nIsrael, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for\r\nthe sins of the world.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:15\r\n 15 And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and thrust\r\ntheir hands into his side, and did feel the prints of the nails\r\nin his hands and in his feet; and this they did do, going forth\r\none by one until they had all gone forth, and did see with their\r\neyes and did feel with their hands, and did know of a surety and\r\ndid bear record, that it was he, of whom it was written by the\r\nprophets, that should come.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:16\r\n 16 And when they had all gone forth and had witnessed for\r\nthemselves, they did cry out with one accord, saying:\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:17\r\n 17 Hosanna! Blessed be the name of the Most High God! And they\r\ndid fall down at the feet of Jesus, and did worship him.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:18\r\n 18 And it came to pass that he spake unto Nephi (for Nephi was\r\namong the multitude) and he commanded him that he should come\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:19\r\n 19 And Nephi arose and went forth, and bowed himself before the\r\nLord and did kiss his feet.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:20\r\n 20 And the Lord commanded him that he should arise. And he\r\narose and stood before him.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:21\r\n 21 And the Lord said unto him: I give unto you power that ye\r\nshall baptize this people when I am again ascended into heaven.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:22\r\n 22 And again the Lord called others, and said unto them\r\nlikewise; and he gave unto them power to baptize. And he said\r\nunto them: On this wise shall ye baptize; and there shall be no\r\ndisputations among you.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:23\r\n 23 Verily I say unto you, that whoso repenteth of his sins\r\nthrough your words and desireth to be baptized in my name, on\r\nthis wise shall ye baptize them--Behold, ye shall go down and\r\nstand in the water, and in my name shall ye baptize them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:24\r\n 24 And now behold, these are the words which ye shall say,\r\ncalling them by name, saying:\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:25\r\n 25 Having authority given me of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in\r\nthe name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:26\r\n 26 And then shall ye immerse them in the water, and come forth\r\nagain out of the water.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:27\r\n 27 And after this manner shall ye baptize in my name; for\r\nbehold, verily I say unto you, that the Father, and the Son, and\r\nthe Holy Ghost are one; and I am in the Father, and the Father in\r\nme, and the Father and I are one.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:28\r\n 28 And according as I have commanded you thus shall ye baptize.\r\nAnd there shall be no disputations among you, as there have\r\nhitherto been; neither shall there be disputations among you\r\nconcerning the points of my doctrine, as there have hitherto\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:29\r\n 29 For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of\r\ncontention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father\r\nof contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend\r\nwith anger, one with another.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:30\r\n 30 Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men\r\nwith anger, one against another; but this is my doctrine, that\r\nsuch things should be done away.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:31\r\n 31 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, I will declare unto\r\nyou my doctrine.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:32\r\n 32 And this is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine which the\r\nFather hath given unto me; and I bear record of the Father, and\r\nthe Father beareth record of me, and the Holy Ghost beareth\r\nrecord of the Father and me; and I bear record that the Father\r\ncommandeth all men, everywhere, to repent and believe in me.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:33\r\n 33 And whoso believeth in me, and is baptized, the same shall be\r\nsaved; and they are they who shall inherit the kingdom of God.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:34\r\n 34 And whoso believeth not in me, and is not baptized, shall be\r\ndamned.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:35\r\n 35 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my doctrine, and\r\nI bear record of it from the Father; and whoso believeth in me\r\nbelieveth in the Father also; and unto him will the Father bear\r\nrecord of me, for he will visit him with fire and with the Holy\r\nGhost.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:36\r\n 36 And thus will the Father bear record of me, and the Holy\r\nGhost will bear record unto him of the Father and me; for the\r\nFather, and I, and the Holy Ghost are one.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:37\r\n 37 And again I say unto you, ye must repent, and become as a\r\nlittle child, and be baptized in my name, or ye can in nowise\r\nreceive these things.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:38\r\n 38 And again I say unto you, ye must repent, and be baptized in\r\nmy name, and become as a little child, or ye can in nowise\r\ninherit the kingdom of God.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:39\r\n 39 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my doctrine, and\r\nwhoso buildeth upon this buildeth upon my rock, and the gates of\r\nhell shall not prevail against them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:40\r\n 40 And whoso shall declare more or less than this, and establish\r\nit for my doctrine, the same cometh of evil, and is not built\r\nupon my rock; but he buildeth upon a sandy foundation, and the\r\ngates of hell stand open to receive such when the floods come and\r\nthe winds beat upon them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 11:41\r\n 41 Therefore, go forth unto this people, and declare the words\r\nwhich I have spoken, unto the ends of the earth.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12\r\nChapter 12\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:1\r\n 1 And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words\r\nunto Nephi, and to those who had been called, (now the number of\r\nthem who had been called, and received power and authority to\r\nbaptize, was twelve) and behold, he stretched forth his hand unto\r\nthe multitude, and cried unto them, saying: Blessed are ye if ye\r\nshall give heed unto the words of these twelve whom I have chosen\r\nfrom among you to minister unto you, and to be your servants; and\r\nunto them I have given power that they may baptize you with\r\nwater; and after that ye are baptized with water, behold, I will\r\nbaptize you with fire and with the Holy Ghost; therefore blessed\r\nare ye if ye shall believe in me and be baptized, after that ye\r\nhave seen me and know that I am.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:2\r\n 2 And again, more blessed are they who shall believe in your\r\nwords because that ye shall testify that ye have seen me, and\r\nthat ye know that I am. Yea, blessed are they who shall believe\r\nin your words, and come down into the depths of humility and be\r\nbaptized, for they shall be visited with fire and with the Holy\r\nGhost, and shall receive a remission of their sins.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:3\r\n 3 Yea, blessed are the poor in spirit who come unto me, for\r\ntheirs is the kingdom of heaven.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:4\r\n 4 And again, blessed are all they that mourn, for they shall be\r\ncomforted.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:5\r\n 5 And blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:6\r\n 6 And blessed are all they who do hunger and thirst after\r\nrighteousness, for they shall be filled with the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:7\r\n 7 And blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:8\r\n 8 And blessed are all the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:9\r\n 9 And blessed are all the peacemakers, for they shall be called\r\nthe children of God.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:10\r\n 10 And blessed are all they who are persecuted for my name's\r\nsake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:11\r\n 11 And blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute,\r\nand shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my\r\nsake;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:12\r\n 12 For ye shall have great joy and be exceedingly glad, for\r\ngreat shall be your reward in heaven; for so persecuted they the\r\nprophets who were before you.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:13\r\n 13 Verily, verily, I say unto you, I give unto you to be the\r\nsalt of the earth; but if the salt shall lose its savor wherewith\r\nshall the earth be salted? The salt shall be thenceforth good for\r\nnothing, but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:14\r\n 14 Verily, verily, I say unto you, I give unto you to be the\r\nlight of this people. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:15\r\n 15 Behold, do men light a candle and put it under a bushel? Nay,\r\nbut on a candlestick, and it giveth light to all that are in the\r\nhouse;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:16\r\n 16 Therefore let your light so shine before this people, that\r\nthey may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:17\r\n 17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets.\r\nI am not come to destroy but to fulfil;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:18\r\n 18 For verily I say unto you, one jot nor tittle hath not passed\r\naway from the law, but in me it hath all been fulfilled.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:19\r\n 19 And behold, I have given you the law and the commandments of\r\nmy Father, that ye shall believe in me, and that ye shall repent\r\nof your sins, and come unto me with a broken heart and a contrite\r\nspirit. Behold, ye have the commandments before you, and the law\r\nis fulfilled.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:20\r\n 20 Therefore come unto me and be ye saved; for verily I say unto\r\nyou, that except ye shall keep my commandments, which I have\r\ncommanded you at this time, ye shall in no case enter into the\r\nkingdom of heaven.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:21\r\n 21 Ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, and\r\nit is also written before you, that thou shalt not kill, and\r\nwhosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment of God;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:22\r\n 22 But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother\r\nshall be in danger of his judgment. And whosoever shall say to\r\nhis brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council; and\r\nwhosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:23\r\n 23 Therefore, if ye shall come unto me, or shall desire to come\r\nunto me, and rememberest that thy brother hast aught against\r\nthee--\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:24\r\n 24 Go thy way unto thy brother, and first be reconciled to thy\r\nbrother, and then come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I\r\nwill receive you.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:25\r\n 25 Agree with thine adversary quickly while thou art in the way\r\nwith him, lest at any time he shall get thee, and thou shalt be\r\ncast into prison.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:26\r\n 26 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come\r\nout thence until thou hast paid the uttermost senine. And while\r\nye are in prison can ye pay even one senine? Verily, verily, I\r\nsay unto you, Nay.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:27\r\n 27 Behold, it is written by them of old time, that thou shalt\r\nnot commit adultery;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:28\r\n 28 But I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman, to\r\nlust after her, hath committed adultery already in his heart.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:29\r\n 29 Behold, I give unto you a commandment, that ye suffer none of\r\nthese things to enter into your heart;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:30\r\n 30 For it is better that ye should deny yourselves of these\r\nthings, wherein ye will take up your cross, than that ye should\r\nbe cast into hell.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:31\r\n 31 It hath been written, that whosoever shall put away his wife,\r\nlet him give her a writing of divorcement.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:32\r\n 32 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that whosoever shall put away\r\nhis wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to\r\ncommit adultery; and whoso shall marry her who is divorced\r\ncommitteth adultery.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:33\r\n 33 And again it is written, thou shalt not forswear thyself, but\r\nshalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:34\r\n 34 But verily, verily, I say unto you, swear not at all; neither\r\nby heaven, for it is God's throne;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:35\r\n 35 Nor by the earth, for it is his footstool;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:36\r\n 36 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not\r\nmake one hair black or white;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:37\r\n 37 But let your communication be Yea, yea; Nay, nay; for\r\nwhatsoever cometh of more than these is evil.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:38\r\n 38 And behold, it is written, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for\r\na tooth;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:39\r\n 39 But I say unto you, that ye shall not resist evil, but\r\nwhosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the\r\nother also;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:40\r\n 40 And if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy\r\ncoat, let him have thy cloak also;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:41\r\n 41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him\r\ntwain.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:42\r\n 42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow\r\nof thee turn not away.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:43\r\n 43 And behold it is written also, that thou shalt love thy\r\nneighbor and hate thine enemy;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:44\r\n 44 But I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse\r\nyou, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them who\r\ndespitefully use you and persecute you;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:45\r\n 45 That ye may be the children of your Father who is in heaven;\r\nfor he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:46\r\n 46 Therefore those things which were of old time, which were\r\nunder the law, in me are all fulfilled.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:47\r\n 47 Old things are done away, and all things have become new.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 12:48\r\n 48 Therefore I would that ye should be perfect even as I, or\r\nyour Father who is in heaven is perfect.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13\r\nChapter 13\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:1\r\n 1 Verily, verily, I say that I would that ye should do alms unto\r\nthe poor; but take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be\r\nseen of them; otherwise ye have no reward of your Father who is\r\nin heaven.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:2\r\n 2 Therefore, when ye shall do your alms do not sound a trumpet\r\nbefore you, as will hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the\r\nstreets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you,\r\nthey have their reward.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:3\r\n 3 But when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy\r\nright hand doeth;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:4\r\n 4 That thine alms may be in secret; and thy Father who seeth in\r\nsecret, himself shall reward thee openly.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:5\r\n 5 And when thou prayest thou shalt not do as the hypocrites, for\r\nthey love to pray, standing in the synagogues and in the corners\r\nof the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto\r\nyou, they have their reward.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:6\r\n 6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when\r\nthou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret; and\r\nthy Father, who seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:7\r\n 7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen,\r\nfor they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:8\r\n 8 Be not ye therefore like unto them, for your Father knoweth\r\nwhat things ye have need of before ye ask him.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:9\r\n 9 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father who art in\r\nheaven, hallowed be thy name.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:10\r\n 10 Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:11\r\n 11 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:12\r\n 12 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:13\r\n 13 For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,\r\nforever. Amen.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:14\r\n 14 For, if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly Father\r\nwill also forgive you;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:15\r\n 15 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your\r\nFather forgive your trespasses.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:16\r\n 16 Moreover, when ye fast be not as the hypocrites, of a sad\r\ncountenance, for they disfigure their faces that they may appear\r\nunto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:17\r\n 17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy\r\nface;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:18\r\n 18 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father,\r\nwho is in secret; and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall\r\nreward thee openly.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:19\r\n 19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth\r\nand rust doth corrupt, and thieves break through and steal;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:20\r\n 20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither\r\nmoth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break\r\nthrough nor steal.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:21\r\n 21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:22\r\n 22 The light of the body is the eye; if, therefore, thine eye be\r\nsingle, thy whole body shall be full of light.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:23\r\n 23 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of\r\ndarkness. If, therefore, the light that is in thee be darkness,\r\nhow great is that darkness!\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:24\r\n 24 No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one\r\nand love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise\r\nthe other. Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:25\r\n 25 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these\r\nwords he looked upon the twelve whom he had chosen, and said unto\r\nthem: Remember the words which I have spoken. For behold, ye are\r\nthey whom I have chosen to minister unto this people. Therefore\r\nI say unto you, take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat,\r\nor what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put\r\non. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:26\r\n 26 Behold the fowls of the air, for they sow not, neither do\r\nthey reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth\r\nthem. Are ye not much better than they?\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:27\r\n 27 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his\r\nstature?\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:28\r\n 28 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of\r\nthe field how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:29\r\n 29 And yet I say unto you, that even Solomon, in all his glory,\r\nwas not arrayed like one of these.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:30\r\n 30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which\r\ntoday is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, even so will he\r\nclothe you, if ye are not of little faith.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:31\r\n 31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or,\r\nWhat shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:32\r\n 32 For your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all\r\nthese things.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:33\r\n 33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness,\r\nand all these things shall be added unto you.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 13:34\r\n 34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow, for the morrow\r\nshall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient is the\r\nday unto the evil thereof.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14\r\nChapter 14\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:1\r\n 1 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words\r\nhe turned again to the multitude, and did open his mouth unto\r\nthem again, saying: Verily, verily, I say unto you, Judge not,\r\nthat ye be not judged.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:2\r\n 2 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with\r\nwhat measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:3\r\n 3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye,\r\nbut considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:4\r\n 4 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother: Let me pull the mote out\r\nof thine eye--and behold, a beam is in thine own eye?\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:5\r\n 5 Thou hypocrite, first cast the beam out of thine own eye; and\r\nthen shalt thou see clearly to cast the mote out of thy brother's\r\neye.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:6\r\n 6 Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye\r\nyour pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their\r\nfeet, and turn again and rend you.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:7\r\n 7 Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and ye shall find;\r\nknock, and it shall be opened unto you.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:8\r\n 8 For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh,\r\nfindeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:9\r\n 9 Or what man is there of you, who, if his son ask bread, will\r\ngive him a stone?\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:10\r\n 10 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:11\r\n 11 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your\r\nchildren, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give\r\ngood things to them that ask him?\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:12\r\n 12 Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that men should do\r\nto you, do ye even so to them, for this is the law and the\r\nprophets.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:13\r\n 13 Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate, and\r\nbroad is the way, which leadeth to destruction, and many there be\r\nwho go in thereat;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:14\r\n 14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which\r\nleadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:15\r\n 15 Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's\r\nclothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:16\r\n 16 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of\r\nthorns, or figs of thistles?\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:17\r\n 17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a\r\ncorrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:18\r\n 18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither a corrupt\r\ntree bring forth good fruit.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:19\r\n 19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down,\r\nand cast into the fire.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:20\r\n 20 Wherefore, by their fruits ye shall know them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:21\r\n 21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter\r\ninto the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my\r\nFather who is in heaven.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:22\r\n 22 Many will say to me in that day: Lord, Lord, have we not\r\nprophesied in thy name, and in thy name have cast out devils, and\r\nin thy name done many wonderful works?\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:23\r\n 23 And then will I profess unto them: I never knew you; depart\r\nfrom me, ye that work iniquity.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:24\r\n 24 Therefore, whoso heareth these sayings of mine and doeth\r\nthem, I will liken him unto a wise man, who built his house upon\r\na rock--\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:25\r\n 25 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds\r\nblew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not, for it was\r\nfounded upon a rock.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:26\r\n 26 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth\r\nthem not shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house\r\nupon the sand--\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 14:27\r\n 27 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds\r\nblew, and beat upon that house; and it fell, and great was the\r\nfall of it.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 15\r\nChapter 15\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 15:1\r\n 1 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had ended these\r\nsayings he cast his eyes round about on the multitude, and said\r\nunto them: Behold, ye have heard the things which I taught before\r\nI ascended to my Father; therefore, whoso remembereth these\r\nsayings of mine and doeth them, him will I raise up at the last\r\nday.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 15:2\r\n 2 And it came to pass that when Jesus had said these words he\r\nperceived that there were some among them who marveled, and\r\nwondered what he would concerning the law of Moses; for they\r\nunderstood not the saying that old things had passed away, and\r\nthat all things had become new.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 15:3\r\n 3 And he said unto them: Marvel not that I said unto you that\r\nold things had passed away, and that all things had become new.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 15:4\r\n 4 Behold, I say unto you that the law is fulfilled that was\r\ngiven unto Moses.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 15:5\r\n 5 Behold, I am he that gave the law, and I am he who covenanted\r\nwith my people Israel; therefore, the law in me is fulfilled, for\r\nI have come to fulfil the law; therefore it hath an end.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 15:6\r\n 6 Behold, I do not destroy the prophets, for as many as have not\r\nbeen fulfilled in me, verily I say unto you, shall all be\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 15:7\r\n 7 And because I said unto you that old things have passed away,\r\nI do not destroy that which hath been spoken concerning things\r\nwhich are to come.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 15:8\r\n 8 For behold, the covenant which I have made with my people is\r\nnot all fulfilled; but the law which was given unto Moses hath an\r\nend in me.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 15:9\r\n 9 Behold, I am the law, and the light. Look unto me, and endure\r\nto the end, and ye shall live; for unto him that endureth to the\r\nend will I give eternal life.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 15:10\r\n 10 Behold, I have given unto you the commandments; therefore\r\nkeep my commandments. And this is the law and the prophets, for\r\nthey truly testified of me.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 15:11\r\n 11 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these\r\nwords, he said unto those twelve whom he had chosen:\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 15:12\r\n 12 Ye are my disciples; and ye are a light unto this people, who\r\nare a remnant of the house of Joseph.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 15:13\r\n 13 And behold, this is the land of your inheritance; and the\r\nFather hath given it unto you.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 15:14\r\n 14 And not at any time hath the Father given me commandment that\r\nI should tell it unto your brethren at Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 15:15\r\n 15 Neither at any time hath the Father given me commandment that\r\nI should tell unto them concerning the other tribes of the house\r\nof Israel, whom the Father hath led away out of the land.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 15:16\r\n 16 This much did the Father command me, that I should tell unto\r\nthem:\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 15:17\r\n 17 That other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also\r\nI must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be\r\none fold, and one shepherd.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 15:18\r\n 18 And now, because of stiffneckedness and unbelief they\r\nunderstood not my word; therefore I was commanded to say no more\r\nof the Father concerning this thing unto them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 15:19\r\n 19 But, verily, I say unto you that the Father hath commanded\r\nme, and I tell it unto you, that ye were separated from among\r\nthem because of their iniquity; therefore it is because of their\r\niniquity that they know not of you.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 15:20\r\n 20 And verily, I say unto you again that the other tribes hath\r\nthe Father separated from them; and it is because of their\r\niniquity that they know not of them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 15:21\r\n 21 And verily I say unto you, that ye are they of whom I said:\r\nOther sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must\r\nbring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold,\r\nand one shepherd.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 15:22\r\n 22 And they understood me not, for they supposed it had been the\r\nGentiles; for they understood not that the Gentiles should be\r\nconverted through their preaching.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 15:23\r\n 23 And they understood me not that I said they shall hear my\r\nvoice; and they understood me not that the Gentiles should not at\r\nany time hear my voice--that I should not manifest myself unto\r\nthem save it were by the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 15:24\r\n 24 But behold, ye have both heard my voice, and seen me; and ye\r\nare my sheep, and ye are numbered among those whom the Father\r\nhath given me.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 16\r\nChapter 16\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 16:1\r\n 1 And verily, verily, I say unto you that I have other sheep\r\nwhich are not of this land, neither of the land of Jerusalem,\r\nneither in any parts of that land round about whither I have been\r\nto minister.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 16:2\r\n 2 For they of whom I speak are they who have not as yet heard my\r\nvoice; neither have I at any time manifested myself unto them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 16:3\r\n 3 But I have received a commandment of the Father that I shall\r\ngo unto them, and that they shall hear my voice, and shall be\r\nnumbered among my sheep, that there may be one fold and one\r\nshepherd; therefore I go to show myself unto them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 16:4\r\n 4 And I command you that ye shall write these sayings after I am\r\ngone, that if it so be that my people at Jerusalem, they who have\r\nseen me and been with me in my ministry, do not ask the Father in\r\nmy name, that they may receive a knowledge of you by the Holy\r\nGhost, and also of the other tribes whom they know not of, that\r\nthese sayings which ye shall write shall be kept and shall be\r\nmanifested unto the Gentiles, that through the fulness of the\r\nGentiles, the remnant of their seed, who shall be scattered forth\r\nupon the face of the earth because of their unbelief, may be\r\nbrought in, or may be brought to a knowledge of me, their\r\nRedeemer.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 16:5\r\n 5 And then will I gather them in from the four quarters of the\r\nearth; and then will I fulfill the covenant which the Father hath\r\nmade unto all the people of the house of Israel.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 16:6\r\n 6 And blessed are the Gentiles, because of their belief in me,\r\nin and of the Holy Ghost, which witnesses unto them of me and of\r\nthe Father.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 16:7\r\n 7 Behold, because of their belief in me, saith the Father, and\r\nbecause of the unbelief of you, O house of Israel, in the latter\r\nday shall the truth come unto the Gentiles, that the fulness of\r\nthese things shall be made known unto them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 16:8\r\n 8 But wo, saith the Father, unto the unbelieving of the\r\nGentiles--for notwithstanding they have come forth upon the face\r\nof this land, and have scattered my people who are of the house\r\nof Israel; and my people who are of the house of Israel have been\r\ncast out from among them, and have been trodden under feet by\r\nthem;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 16:9\r\n 9 And because of the mercies of the Father unto the Gentiles,\r\nand also the judgments of the Father upon my people who are of\r\nthe house of Israel, verily, verily, I say unto you, that after\r\nall this, and I have caused my people who are of the house of\r\nIsrael to be smitten, and to be afflicted, and to be slain, and\r\nto be cast out from among them, and to become hated by them, and\r\nto become a hiss and a byword among them--\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 16:10\r\n 10 And thus commandeth the Father that I should say unto you: At\r\nthat day when the Gentiles shall sin against my gospel, and shall\r\nreject the fulness of my gospel, and shall be lifted up in the\r\npride of their hearts above all nations, and above all the people\r\nof the whole earth, and shall be filled with all manner of\r\nlyings, and of deceits, and of mischiefs, and all manner of\r\nhypocrisy, and murders, and priestcrafts, and whoredoms, and of\r\nsecret abominations; and if they shall do all those things, and\r\nshall reject the fulness of my gospel, behold, saith the Father,\r\nI will bring the fulness of my gospel from among them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 16:11\r\n 11 And then will I remember my covenant which I have made unto\r\nmy people, O house of Israel, and I will bring my gospel unto\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 16:12\r\n 12 And I will show unto thee, O house of Israel, that the\r\nGentiles shall not have power over you; but I will remember my\r\ncovenant unto you, O house of Israel, and ye shall come unto the\r\nknowledge of the fulness of my gospel.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 16:13\r\n 13 But if the Gentiles will repent and return unto me, saith the\r\nFather, behold they shall be numbered among my people, O house of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 16:14\r\n 14 And I will not suffer my people, who are of the house of\r\nIsrael, to go through among them, and tread them down, saith the\r\nFather.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 16:15\r\n 15 But if they will not turn unto me, and hearken unto my voice,\r\nI will suffer them, yea, I will suffer my people, O house of\r\nIsrael, that they shall go through among them, and shall tread\r\nthem down, and they shall be as salt that hath lost its savor,\r\nwhich is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out, and to\r\nbe trodden under foot of my people, O house of Israel.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 16:16\r\n 16 Verily, verily, I say unto you, thus hath the Father\r\ncommanded me--that I should give unto this people this land for\r\ntheir inheritance.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 16:17\r\n 17 And then the words of the prophet Isaiah shall be fulfilled,\r\nwhich say:\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 16:18\r\n 18 Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together\r\nshall they sing, for they shall see eye to eye when the Lord\r\nshall bring again Zion.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 16:19\r\n 19 Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of\r\nJerusalem; for the Lord hath comforted his people, he hath\r\nredeemed Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 16:20\r\n 20 The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eye of all the\r\nnations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17\r\nChapter 17\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17:1\r\n 1 Behold, now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these\r\nwords he looked round about again on the multitude, and he said\r\nunto them: Behold, my time is at hand.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17:2\r\n 2 I perceive that ye are weak, that ye cannot understand all my\r\nwords which I am commanded of the Father to speak unto you at\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17:3\r\n 3 Therefore, go ye unto your homes, and ponder upon the things\r\nwhich I have said, and ask of the Father, in my name, that ye may\r\nunderstand, and prepare your minds for the morrow, and I come\r\nunto you again.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17:4\r\n 4 But now I go unto the Father, and also to show myself unto the\r\nlost tribes of Israel, for they are not lost unto the Father, for\r\nhe knoweth whither he hath taken them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17:5\r\n 5 And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus spoken, he cast\r\nhis eyes round about again on the multitude, and beheld they were\r\nin tears, and did look steadfastly upon him as if they would ask\r\nhim to tarry a little longer with them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17:6\r\n 6 And he said unto them: Behold, my bowels are filled with\r\ncompassion towards you.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17:7\r\n 7 Have ye any that are sick among you? Bring them hither. Have\r\nye any that are lame, or blind, or halt, or maimed, or leprous,\r\nor that are withered, or that are deaf, or that are afflicted in\r\nany manner? Bring them hither and I will heal them, for I have\r\ncompassion upon you; my bowels are filled with mercy.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17:8\r\n 8 For I perceive that ye desire that I should show unto you what\r\nI have done unto your brethren at Jerusalem, for I see that your\r\nfaith is sufficient that I should heal you.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17:9\r\n 9 And it came to pass that when he had thus spoken, all the\r\nmultitude, with one accord, did go forth with their sick and\r\ntheir afflicted, and their lame, and with their blind, and with\r\ntheir dumb, and with all them that were afflicted in any manner;\r\nand he did heal them every one as they were brought forth unto\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17:10\r\n 10 And they did all, both they who had been healed and they who\r\nwere whole, bow down at his feet, and did worship him; and as\r\nmany as could come for the multitude did kiss his feet, insomuch\r\nthat they did bathe his feet with their tears.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17:11\r\n 11 And it came to pass that he commanded that their little\r\nchildren should be brought.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17:12\r\n 12 So they brought their little children and set them down upon\r\nthe ground round about him, and Jesus stood in the midst; and the\r\nmultitude gave way till they had all been brought unto him.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17:13\r\n 13 And it came to pass that when they had all been brought, and\r\nJesus stood in the midst, he commanded the multitude that they\r\nshould kneel down upon the ground.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17:14\r\n 14 And it came to pass that when they had knelt upon the ground,\r\nJesus groaned within himself, and said: Father, I am troubled\r\nbecause of the wickedness of the people of the house of Israel.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17:15\r\n 15 And when he had said these words, he himself also knelt upon\r\nthe earth; and behold he prayed unto the Father, and the things\r\nwhich he prayed cannot be written, and the multitude did bear\r\nrecord who heard him.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17:16\r\n 16 And after this manner do they bear record: The eye hath never\r\nseen, neither hath the ear heard, before, so great and marvelous\r\nthings as we saw and heard Jesus speak unto the Father;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17:17\r\n 17 And no tongue can speak, neither can there be written by any\r\nman, neither can the hearts of men conceive so great and\r\nmarvelous things as we both saw and heard Jesus speak; and no one\r\ncan conceive of the joy which filled our souls at the time we\r\nheard him pray for us unto the Father.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17:18\r\n 18 And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of\r\npraying unto the Father, he arose; but so great was the joy of\r\nthe multitude that they were overcome.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17:19\r\n 19 And it came to pass that Jesus spake unto them, and bade them\r\narise.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17:20\r\n 20 And they arose from the earth, and he said unto them: Blessed\r\nare ye because of your faith. And now behold, my joy is full.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17:21\r\n 21 And when he had said these words, he wept, and the multitude\r\nbare record of it, and he took their little children, one by one,\r\nand blessed them, and prayed unto the Father for them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17:22\r\n 22 And when he had done this he wept again;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17:23\r\n 23 And he spake unto the multitude, and said unto them: Behold\r\nyour little ones.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17:24\r\n 24 And as they looked to behold they cast their eyes towards\r\nheaven, and they saw the heavens open, and they saw angels\r\ndescending out of heaven as it were in the midst of fire; and\r\nthey came down and encircled those little ones about, and they\r\nwere encircled about with fire; and the angels did minister unto\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 17:25\r\n 25 And the multitude did see and hear and bear record; and they\r\nknow that their record is true for they all of them did see and\r\nhear, every man for himself; and they were in number about two\r\nthousand and five hundred souls; and they did consist of men,\r\nwomen, and children.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18\r\nChapter 18\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:1\r\n 1 And it came to pass that Jesus commanded his disciples that\r\nthey should bring forth some bread and wine unto him.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:2\r\n 2 And while they were gone for bread and wine, he commanded the\r\nmultitude that they should sit themselves down upon the earth.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:3\r\n 3 And when the disciples had come with bread and wine, he took\r\nof the bread and brake and blessed it; and he gave unto the\r\ndisciples and commanded that they should eat.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:4\r\n 4 And when they had eaten and were filled, he commanded that\r\nthey should give unto the multitude.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:5\r\n 5 And when the multitude had eaten and were filled, he said unto\r\nthe disciples: Behold there shall one be ordained among you, and\r\nto him will I give power that he shall break bread and bless it\r\nand give it unto the people of my church, unto all those who\r\nshall believe and be baptized in my name.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:6\r\n 6 And this shall ye always observe to do, even as I have done,\r\neven as I have broken bread and blessed it and given it unto you.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:7\r\n 7 And this shall ye do in remembrance of my body, which I have\r\nshown unto you. And it shall be a testimony unto the Father that\r\nye do always remember me. And if ye do always remember me ye\r\nshall have my Spirit to be with you.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:8\r\n 8 And it came to pass that when he said these words, he\r\ncommanded his disciples that they should take of the wine of the\r\ncup and drink of it, and that they should also give unto the\r\nmultitude that they might drink of it.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:9\r\n 9 And it came to pass that they did so, and did drink of it and\r\nwere filled; and they gave unto the multitude, and they did\r\ndrink, and they were filled.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:10\r\n 10 And when the disciples had done this, Jesus said unto them:\r\nBlessed are ye for this thing which ye have done, for this is\r\nfulfilling my commandments, and this doth witness unto the Father\r\nthat ye are willing to do that which I have commanded you.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:11\r\n 11 And this shall ye always do to those who repent and are\r\nbaptized in my name; and ye shall do it in remembrance of my\r\nblood, which I have shed for you, that ye may witness unto the\r\nFather that ye do always remember me. And if ye do always\r\nremember me ye shall have my Spirit to be with you.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:12\r\n 12 And I give unto you a commandment that ye shall do these\r\nthings. And if ye shall always do these things blessed are ye,\r\nfor ye are built upon my rock.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:13\r\n 13 But whoso among you shall do more or less than these are not\r\nbuilt upon my rock, but are built upon a sandy foundation; and\r\nwhen the rain descends, and the floods come, and the winds blow,\r\nand beat upon them, they shall fall, and the gates of hell are\r\nready open to receive them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:14\r\n 14 Therefore blessed are ye if ye shall keep my commandments,\r\nwhich the Father hath commanded me that I should give unto you.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:15\r\n 15 Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray\r\nalways, lest ye be tempted by the devil, and ye be led away\r\ncaptive by him.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:16\r\n 16 And as I have prayed among you even so shall ye pray in my\r\nchurch, among my people who do repent and are baptized in my\r\nname. Behold I am the light; I have set an example for you.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:17\r\n 17 And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words\r\nunto his disciples, he turned again unto the multitude and said\r\nunto them:\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:18\r\n 18 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and\r\npray always lest ye enter into temptation; for Satan desireth to\r\nhave you, that he may sift you as wheat.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:19\r\n 19 Therefore ye must always pray unto the Father in my name;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:20\r\n 20 And whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is\r\nright, believing that ye shall receive, behold it shall be given\r\nunto you.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:21\r\n 21 Pray in your families unto the Father, always in my name,\r\nthat your wives and your children may be blessed.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:22\r\n 22 And behold, ye shall meet together oft; and ye shall not\r\nforbid any man from coming unto you when ye shall meet together,\r\nbut suffer them that they may come unto you and forbid them not;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:23\r\n 23 But ye shall pray for them, and shall not cast them out; and\r\nif it so be that they come unto you oft ye shall pray for them\r\nunto the Father, in my name.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:24\r\n 24 Therefore, hold up your light that it may shine unto the\r\nworld. Behold I am the light which ye shall hold up--that which\r\nye have seen me do. Behold ye see that I have prayed unto the\r\nFather, and ye all have witnessed.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:25\r\n 25 And ye see that I have commanded that none of you should go\r\naway, but rather have commanded that ye should come unto me, that\r\nye might feel and see; even so shall ye do unto the world; and\r\nwhosoever breaketh this commandment suffereth himself to be led\r\ninto temptation.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:26\r\n 26 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these\r\nwords, he turned his eyes again upon the disciples whom he had\r\nchosen, and said unto them:\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:27\r\n 27 Behold verily, verily, I say unto you, I give unto you\r\nanother commandment, and then I must go unto my Father that I may\r\nfulfil other commandments which he hath given me.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:28\r\n 28 And now behold, this is the commandment which I give unto\r\nyou, that ye shall not suffer any one knowingly to partake of my\r\nflesh and blood unworthily, when ye shall minister it;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:29\r\n 29 For whoso eateth and drinketh my flesh and blood unworthily\r\neateth and drinketh damnation to his soul; therefore if ye know\r\nthat a man is unworthy to eat and drink of my flesh and blood ye\r\nshall forbid him.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:30\r\n 30 Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out from among you, but\r\nye shall minister unto him and shall pray for him unto the\r\nFather, in my name; and if it so be that he repenteth and is\r\nbaptized in my name, then shall ye receive him, and shall\r\nminister unto him of my flesh and blood.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:31\r\n 31 But if he repent not he shall not be numbered among my\r\npeople, that he may not destroy my people, for behold I know my\r\nsheep, and they are numbered.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:32\r\n 32 Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out of your synagogues,\r\nor your places of worship, for unto such shall ye continue to\r\nminister; for ye know not but what they will return and repent,\r\nand come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I shall heal\r\nthem; and ye shall be the means of bringing salvation unto them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:33\r\n 33 Therefore, keep these sayings which I have commanded you that\r\nye come not under condemnation; for wo unto him whom the Father\r\ncondemneth.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:34\r\n 34 And I give you these commandments because of the disputations\r\nwhich have been among you. And blessed are ye if ye have no\r\ndisputations among you.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:35\r\n 35 And now I go unto the Father, because it is expedient that I\r\nshould go unto the Father for your sakes.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:36\r\n 36 And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of these\r\nsayings, he touched with his hand the disciples whom he had\r\nchosen, one by one, even until he had touched them all, and spake\r\nunto them as he touched them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:37\r\n 37 And the multitude heard not the words which he spake,\r\ntherefore they did not bear record; but the disciples bare record\r\nthat he gave them power to give the Holy Ghost. And I will show\r\nunto you hereafter that this record is true.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:38\r\n 38 And it came to pass that when Jesus had touched them all,\r\nthere came a cloud and overshadowed the multitude that they could\r\nnot see Jesus.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 18:39\r\n 39 And while they were overshadowed he departed from them, and\r\nascended into heaven. And the disciples saw and did bear record\r\nthat he ascended again into heaven.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19\r\nChapter 19\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:1\r\n 1 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had ascended into\r\nheaven, the multitude did disperse, and every man did take his\r\nwife and his children and did return to his own home.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:2\r\n 2 And it was noised abroad among the people immediately, before\r\nit was yet dark, that the multitude had seen Jesus, and that he\r\nhad ministered unto them, and that he would also show himself on\r\nthe morrow unto the multitude.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:3\r\n 3 Yea, and even all the night it was noised abroad concerning\r\nJesus; and insomuch did they send forth unto the people that\r\nthere were many, yea, an exceedingly great number, did labor\r\nexceedingly all that night, that they might be on the morrow in\r\nthe place where Jesus should show himself unto the multitude.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:4\r\n 4 And it came to pass that on the morrow, when the multitude was\r\ngathered together, behold, Nephi and his brother whom he had\r\nraised from the dead, whose name was Timothy, and also his son,\r\nwhose name was Jonas, and also Mathoni, and Mathonihah, his\r\nbrother, and Kumen, and Kumenonhi, and Jeremiah, and Shemnon, and\r\nJonas, and Zedekiah, and Isaiah--now these were the names of the\r\ndisciples whom Jesus had chosen--and it came to pass that they\r\nwent forth and stood in the midst of the multitude.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:5\r\n 5 And behold, the multitude was so great that they did cause\r\nthat they should be separated into twelve bodies.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:6\r\n 6 And the twelve did teach the multitude; and behold, they did\r\ncause that the multitude should kneel down upon the face of the\r\nearth, and should pray unto the Father in the name of Jesus.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:7\r\n 7 And the disciples did pray unto the Father also in the name of\r\nJesus. And it came to pass that they arose and ministered unto\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:8\r\n 8 And when they had ministered those same words which Jesus had\r\nspoken--nothing varying from the words which Jesus had\r\nspoken--behold, they knelt again and prayed to the Father in the\r\nname of Jesus.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:9\r\n 9 And they did pray for that which they most desired; and they\r\ndesired that the Holy Ghost should be given unto them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:10\r\n 10 And when they had thus prayed they went down unto the water's\r\nedge, and the multitude followed them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:11\r\n 11 And it came to pass that Nephi went down into the water and\r\nwas baptized.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:12\r\n 12 And he came up out of the water and began to baptize. And he\r\nbaptized all those whom Jesus had chosen.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:13\r\n 13 And it came to pass when they were all baptized and had come\r\nup out of the water, the Holy Ghost did fall upon them, and they\r\nwere filled with the Holy Ghost and with fire.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:14\r\n 14 And behold, they were encircled about as if it were by fire;\r\nand it came down from heaven, and the multitude did witness it,\r\nand did bear record; and angels did come down out of heaven and\r\ndid minister unto them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:15\r\n 15 And it came to pass that while the angels were ministering\r\nunto the disciples, behold, Jesus came and stood in the midst and\r\nministered unto them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:16\r\n 16 And it came to pass that he spake unto the multitude, and\r\ncommanded them that they should kneel down again upon the earth,\r\nand also that his disciples should kneel down upon the earth.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:17\r\n 17 And it came to pass that when they had all knelt down upon\r\nthe earth, he commanded his disciples that they should pray.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:18\r\n 18 And behold, they began to pray; and they did pray unto Jesus,\r\ncalling him their Lord and their God.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:19\r\n 19 And it came to pass that Jesus departed out of the midst of\r\nthem, and went a little way off from them and bowed himself to\r\nthe earth, and he said:\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:20\r\n 20 Father, I thank thee that thou hast given the Holy Ghost unto\r\nthese whom I have chosen; and it is because of their belief in me\r\nthat I have chosen them out of the world.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:21\r\n 21 Father, I pray thee that thou wilt give the Holy Ghost unto\r\nall them that shall believe in their words.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:22\r\n 22 Father, thou hast given them the Holy Ghost because they\r\nbelieve in me; and thou seest that they believe in me because\r\nthou hearest them, and they pray unto me; and they pray unto me\r\nbecause I am with them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:23\r\n 23 And now Father, I pray unto thee for them, and also for all\r\nthose who shall believe on their words, that they may believe in\r\nme, that I may be in them as thou, Father, art in me, that we may\r\nbe one.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:24\r\n 24 And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus prayed unto the\r\nFather, he came unto his disciples, and behold, they did still\r\ncontinue, without ceasing, to pray unto him; and they did not\r\nmultiply many words, for it was given unto them what they should\r\npray, and they were filled with desire.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:25\r\n 25 And it came to pass that Jesus blessed them as they did pray\r\nunto him; and his countenance did smile upon them, and the light\r\nof his countenance did shine upon them, and behold they were as\r\nwhite as the countenance and also the garments of Jesus; and\r\nbehold the whiteness thereof did exceed all the whiteness, yea,\r\neven there could be nothing upon earth so white as the whiteness\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:26\r\n 26 And Jesus said unto them: Pray on; nevertheless they did not\r\ncease to pray.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:27\r\n 27 And he turned from them again, and went a little way off and\r\nbowed himself to the earth; and he prayed again unto the Father,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:28\r\n 28 Father, I thank thee that thou hast purified those whom I\r\nhave chosen, because of their faith, and I pray for them, and\r\nalso for them who shall believe on their words, that they may be\r\npurified in me, through faith on their words, even as they are\r\npurified in me.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:29\r\n 29 Father, I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou\r\nhast given me out of the world, because of their faith, that they\r\nmay be purified in me, that I may be in them as thou, Father, art\r\nin me, that we may be one, that I may be glorified in them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:30\r\n 30 And when Jesus had spoken these words he came again unto his\r\ndisciples; and behold they did pray steadfastly, without ceasing,\r\nunto him; and he did smile upon them again; and behold they were\r\nwhite, even as Jesus.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:31\r\n 31 And it came to pass that he went again a little way off and\r\nprayed unto the Father;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:32\r\n 32 And tongue cannot speak the words which he prayed, neither\r\ncan be written by man the words which he prayed.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:33\r\n 33 And the multitude did hear and do bear record; and their\r\nhearts were open and they did understand in their hearts the\r\nwords which he prayed.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:34\r\n 34 Nevertheless, so great and marvelous were the words which he\r\nprayed that they cannot be written, neither can they be uttered\r\nby man.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:35\r\n 35 And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of\r\npraying he came again to the disciples, and said unto them: So\r\ngreat faith have I never seen among all the Jews; wherefore I\r\ncould not show unto them so great miracles, because of their\r\nunbelief.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 19:36\r\n 36 Verily I say unto you, there are none of them that have seen\r\nso great things as ye have seen; neither have they heard so great\r\nthings as ye have heard.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20\r\nChapter 20\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:1\r\n 1 And it came to pass that he commanded the multitude that they\r\nshould cease to pray, and also his disciples. And he commanded\r\nthem that they should not cease to pray in their hearts.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:2\r\n 2 And he commanded them that they should arise and stand up upon\r\ntheir feet. And they arose up and stood upon their feet.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:3\r\n 3 And it came to pass that he brake bread again and blessed it,\r\nand gave to the disciples to eat.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:4\r\n 4 And when they had eaten he commanded them that they should\r\nbreak bread, and give unto the multitude.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:5\r\n 5 And when they had given unto the multitude he also gave them\r\nwine to drink, and commanded them that they should give unto the\r\nmultitude.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:6\r\n 6 Now, there had been no bread, neither wine, brought by the\r\ndisciples, neither by the multitude;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:7\r\n 7 But he truly gave unto them bread to eat, and also wine to\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:8\r\n 8 And he said unto them: He that eateth this bread eateth of my\r\nbody to his soul; and he that drinketh of this wine drinketh of\r\nmy blood to his soul; and his soul shall never hunger nor thirst,\r\nbut shall be filled.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:9\r\n 9 Now, when the multitude had all eaten and drunk, behold, they\r\nwere filled with the Spirit; and they did cry out with one voice,\r\nand gave glory to Jesus, whom they both saw and heard.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:10\r\n 10 And it came to pass that when they had all given glory unto\r\nJesus, he said unto them: Behold now I finish the commandment\r\nwhich the Father hath commanded me concerning this people, who\r\nare a remnant of the house of Israel.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:11\r\n 11 Ye remember that I spake unto you, and said that when the\r\nwords of Isaiah should be fulfilled--behold they are written, ye\r\nhave them before you, therefore search them--\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:12\r\n 12 And verily, verily, I say unto you, that when they shall be\r\nfulfilled then is the fulfilling of the covenant which the Father\r\nhath made unto his people, O house of Israel.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:13\r\n 13 And then shall the remnants, which shall be scattered abroad\r\nupon the face of the earth, be gathered in from the east and from\r\nthe west, and from the south and from the north; and they shall\r\nbe brought to the knowledge of the Lord their God, who hath\r\nredeemed them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:14\r\n 14 And the Father hath commanded me that I should give unto you\r\nthis land, for your inheritance.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:15\r\n 15 And I say unto you, that if the Gentiles do not repent after\r\nthe blessing which they shall receive, after they have scattered\r\nmy people--\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:16\r\n 16 Then shall ye, who are a remnant of the house of Jacob, go\r\nforth among them; and ye shall be in the midst of them who shall\r\nbe many; and ye shall be among them as a lion among the beasts of\r\nthe forest, and as a young lion among the flocks of sheep, who,\r\nif he goeth through both treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and\r\nnone can deliver.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:17\r\n 17 Thy hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all\r\nthine enemies shall be cut off.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:18\r\n 18 And I will gather my people together as a man gathereth his\r\nsheaves into the floor.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:19\r\n 19 For I will make my people with whom the Father hath\r\ncovenanted, yea, I will make thy horn iron, and I will make thy\r\nhoofs brass. And thou shalt beat in pieces many people; and I\r\nwill consecrate their gain unto the Lord, and their substance\r\nunto the Lord of the whole earth. And behold, I am he who doeth\r\nit.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:20\r\n 20 And it shall come to pass, saith the Father, that the sword\r\nof my justice shall hang over them at that day; and except they\r\nrepent it shall fall upon them, saith the Father, yea, even upon\r\nall the nations of the Gentiles.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:21\r\n 21 And it shall come to pass that I will establish my people, O\r\nhouse of Israel.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:22\r\n 22 And behold, this people will I establish in this land, unto\r\nthe fulfilling of the covenant which I made with your father\r\nJacob; and it shall be a New Jerusalem. And the powers of heaven\r\nshall be in the midst of this people; yea, even I will be in the\r\nmidst of you.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:23\r\n 23 Behold, I am he of whom Moses spake, saying: A prophet shall\r\nthe Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto\r\nme; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto\r\nyou. And it shall come to pass that every soul who will not hear\r\nthat prophet shall be cut off from among the people.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:24\r\n 24 Verily I say unto you, yea, and all the prophets from Samuel\r\nand those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have\r\ntestified of me.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:25\r\n 25 And behold, ye are the children of the prophets; and ye are\r\nof the house of Israel; and ye are of the covenant which the\r\nFather made with your fathers, saying unto Abraham: And in thy\r\nseed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:26\r\n 26 The Father having raised me up unto you first, and sent me to\r\nbless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities;\r\nand this because ye are the children of the covenant--\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:27\r\n 27 And after that ye were blessed then fulfilleth the Father the\r\ncovenant which he made with Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall\r\nall the kindreds of the earth be blessed--unto the pouring out of\r\nthe Holy Ghost through me upon the Gentiles, which blessing upon\r\nthe Gentiles shall make them mighty above all, unto the\r\nscattering of my people, O house of Israel.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:28\r\n 28 And they shall be a scourge unto the people of this land.\r\nNevertheless, when they shall have received the fulness of my\r\ngospel, then if they shall harden their hearts against me I will\r\nreturn their iniquities upon their own heads, saith the Father.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:29\r\n 29 And I will remember the covenant which I have made with my\r\npeople; and I have covenanted with them that I would gather them\r\ntogether in mine own due time, that I would give unto them again\r\nthe land of their fathers for their inheritance, which is the\r\nland of Jerusalem, which is the promised land unto them forever,\r\nsaith the Father.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:30\r\n 30 And it shall come to pass that the time cometh, when the\r\nfulness of my gospel shall be preached unto them;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:31\r\n 31 And they shall believe in me, that I am Jesus Christ, the Son\r\nof God, and shall pray unto the Father in my name.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:32\r\n 32 Then shall their watchmen lift up their voice, and with the\r\nvoice together shall they sing; for they shall see eye to eye.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:33\r\n 33 Then will the Father gather them together again, and give\r\nunto them Jerusalem for the land of their inheritance.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:34\r\n 34 Then shall they break forth into joy--Sing together, ye waste\r\nplaces of Jerusalem; for the Father hath comforted his people, he\r\nhath redeemed Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:35\r\n 35 The Father hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the\r\nnations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of\r\nthe Father; and the Father and I are one.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:36\r\n 36 And then shall be brought to pass that which is written:\r\nAwake, awake again, and put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy\r\nbeautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city, for henceforth\r\nthere shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the\r\nunclean.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:37\r\n 37 Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit down, O Jerusalem;\r\nloose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of\r\nZion.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:38\r\n 38 For thus saith the Lord: Ye have sold yourselves for naught,\r\nand ye shall be redeemed without money.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:39\r\n 39 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that my people shall know my\r\nname; yea, in that day they shall know that I am he that doth\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:40\r\n 40 And then shall they say: How beautiful upon the mountains are\r\nthe feet of him that bringeth good tidings unto them, that\r\npublisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings unto them of good,\r\nthat publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion: Thy God\r\nreigneth!\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:41\r\n 41 And then shall a cry go forth: Depart ye, depart ye, go ye\r\nout from thence, touch not that which is unclean; go ye out of\r\nthe midst of her; be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:42\r\n 42 For ye shall not go out with haste nor go by flight; for the\r\nLord will go before you, and the God of Israel shall be your\r\nrearward.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:43\r\n 43 Behold, my servant shall deal prudently; he shall be exalted\r\nand extolled and be very high.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:44\r\n 44 As many were astonished at thee--his visage was so marred,\r\nmore than any man, and his form more than the sons of men--\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:45\r\n 45 So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their\r\nmouths at him, for that which had not been told them shall they\r\nsee; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 20:46\r\n 46 Verily, verily, I say unto you, all these things shall surely\r\ncome, even as the Father hath commanded me. Then shall this\r\ncovenant which the Father hath covenanted with his people be\r\nfulfilled; and then shall Jerusalem be inhabited again with my\r\npeople, and it shall be the land of their inheritance.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21\r\nChapter 21\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:1\r\n 1 And verily I say unto you, I give unto you a sign, that ye may\r\nknow the time when these things shall be about to take\r\nplace--that I shall gather in, from their long dispersion, my\r\npeople, O house of Israel, and shall establish again among them\r\nmy Zion;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:2\r\n 2 And behold, this is the thing which I will give unto you for a\r\nsign--for verily I say unto you that when these things which I\r\ndeclare unto you, and which I shall declare unto you hereafter of\r\nmyself, and by the power of the Holy Ghost which shall be given\r\nunto you of the Father, shall be made known unto the Gentiles\r\nthat they may know concerning this people who are a remnant of\r\nthe house of Jacob, and concerning this my people who shall be\r\nscattered by them;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:3\r\n 3 Verily, verily, I say unto you, when these things shall be\r\nmade known unto them of the Father, and shall come forth of the\r\nFather, from them unto you;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:4\r\n 4 For it is wisdom in the Father that they should be established\r\nin this land, and be set up as a free people by the power of the\r\nFather, that these things might come forth from them unto a\r\nremnant of your seed, that the covenant of the Father may be\r\nfulfilled which he hath covenanted with his people, O house of\r\nIsrael;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:5\r\n 5 Therefore, when these works and the works which shall be\r\nwrought among you hereafter shall come forth from the Gentiles,\r\nunto your seed which shall dwindle in unbelief because of\r\niniquity;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:6\r\n 6 For thus it behooveth the Father that it should come forth\r\nfrom the Gentiles, that he may show forth his power unto the\r\nGentiles, for this cause that the Gentiles, if they will not\r\nharden their hearts, that they may repent and come unto me and be\r\nbaptized in my name and know of the true points of my doctrine,\r\nthat they may be numbered among my people, O house of Israel;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:7\r\n 7 And when these things come to pass that thy seed shall begin\r\nto know these things--it shall be a sign unto them, that they may\r\nknow that the work of the Father hath already commenced unto the\r\nfulfilling of the covenant which he hath made unto the people who\r\nare of the house of Israel.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:8\r\n 8 And when that day shall come, it shall come to pass that kings\r\nshall shut their mouths; for that which had not been told them\r\nshall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:9\r\n 9 For in that day, for my sake shall the Father work a work,\r\nwhich shall be a great and a marvelous work among them; and there\r\nshall be among them those who will not believe it, although a man\r\nshall declare it unto them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:10\r\n 10 But behold, the life of my servant shall be in my hand;\r\ntherefore they shall not hurt him, although he shall be marred\r\nbecause of them. Yet I will heal him, for I will show unto them\r\nthat my wisdom is greater than the cunning of the devil.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:11\r\n 11 Therefore it shall come to pass that whosoever will not\r\nbelieve in my words, who am Jesus Christ, which the Father shall\r\ncause him to bring forth unto the Gentiles, and shall give unto\r\nhim power that he shall bring them forth unto the Gentiles, (it\r\nshall be done even as Moses said) they shall be cut off from\r\namong my people who are of the covenant.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:12\r\n 12 And my people who are a remnant of Jacob shall be among the\r\nGentiles, yea, in the midst of them as a lion among the beasts of\r\nthe forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep, who, if he\r\ngo through both treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and none can\r\ndeliver.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:13\r\n 13 Their hand shall be lifted up upon their adversaries, and all\r\ntheir enemies shall be cut off.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:14\r\n 14 Yea, wo be unto the Gentiles except they repent; for it shall\r\ncome to pass in that day, saith the Father, that I will cut off\r\nthy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy\r\nchariots;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:15\r\n 15 And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all\r\nthy strongholds;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:16\r\n 16 And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thy land, and thou\r\nshalt have no more soothsayers;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:17\r\n 17 Thy graven images I will also cut off, and thy standing\r\nimages out of the midst of thee, and thou shalt no more worship\r\nthe works of thy hands;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:18\r\n 18 And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee; so\r\nwill I destroy thy cities.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:19\r\n 19 And it shall come to pass that all lyings, and deceivings,\r\nand envyings, and strifes, and priestcrafts, and whoredoms, shall\r\nbe done away.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:20\r\n 20 For it shall come to pass, saith the Father, that at that day\r\nwhosoever will not repent and come unto my Beloved Son, them will\r\nI cut off from among my people, O house of Israel;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:21\r\n 21 And I will execute vengeance and fury upon them, even as upon\r\nthe heathen, such as they have not heard.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:22\r\n 22 But if they will repent and hearken unto my words, and harden\r\nnot their hearts, I will establish my church among them, and they\r\nshall come in unto the covenant and be numbered among this the\r\nremnant of Jacob, unto whom I have given this land for their\r\ninheritance;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:23\r\n 23 And they shall assist my people, the remnant of Jacob, and\r\nalso as many of the house of Israel as shall come, that they may\r\nbuild a city, which shall be called the New Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:24\r\n 24 And then shall they assist my people that they may be\r\ngathered in, who are scattered upon all the face of the land, in\r\nunto the New Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:25\r\n 25 And then shall the power of heaven come down among them; and\r\nI also will be in the midst.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:26\r\n 26 And then shall the work of the Father commence at that day,\r\neven when this gospel shall be preached among the remnant of this\r\npeople. Verily I say unto you, at that day shall the work of the\r\nFather commence among all the dispersed of my people, yea, even\r\nthe tribes which have been lost, which the Father hath led away\r\nout of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:27\r\n 27 Yea, the work shall commence among all the dispersed of my\r\npeople, with the Father to prepare the way whereby they may come\r\nunto me, that they may call on the Father in my name.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:28\r\n 28 Yea, and then shall the work commence, with the Father among\r\nall nations in preparing the way whereby his people may be\r\ngathered home to the land of their inheritance.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 21:29\r\n 29 And they shall go out from all nations; and they shall not go\r\nout in haste, nor go by flight, for I will go before them, saith\r\nthe Father, and I will be their rearward.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 22\r\nChapter 22\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 22:1\r\n 1 And then shall that which is written come to pass: Sing, O\r\nbarren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and\r\ncry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child; for more are\r\nthe children of the desolate than the children of the married\r\nwife, saith the Lord.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 22:2\r\n 2 Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the\r\ncurtains of thy habitations; spare not, lengthen thy cords and\r\nstrengthen thy stakes;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 22:3\r\n 3 For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left,\r\nand thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles and make the desolate\r\ncities to be inhabited.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 22:4\r\n 4 Fear not, for thou shalt not be ashamed; neither be thou\r\nconfounded, for thou shalt not be put to shame; for thou shalt\r\nforget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the\r\nreproach of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy\r\nwidowhood any more.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 22:5\r\n 5 For thy maker, thy husband, the Lord of Hosts is his name; and\r\nthy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel--the God of the whole earth\r\nshall he be called.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 22:6\r\n 6 For the Lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved\r\nin spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 22:7\r\n 7 For a small moment have I forsaken thee, but with great\r\nmercies will I gather thee.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 22:8\r\n 8 In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment, but\r\nwith everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the\r\nLord thy Redeemer.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 22:9\r\n 9 For this, the waters of Noah unto me, for as I have sworn that\r\nthe waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, so have I\r\nsworn that I would not be wroth with thee.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 22:10\r\n 10 For the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed, but\r\nmy kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the\r\ncovenant of my peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy\r\non thee.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 22:11\r\n 11 O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted!\r\nBehold, I will lay thy stones with fair colors, and lay thy\r\nfoundations with sapphires.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 22:12\r\n 12 And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of\r\ncarbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 22:13\r\n 13 And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great\r\nshall be the peace of thy children.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 22:14\r\n 14 In righteousness shalt thou be established; thou shalt be far\r\nfrom oppression for thou shalt not fear, and from terror for it\r\nshall not come near thee.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 22:15\r\n 15 Behold, they shall surely gather together against thee, not\r\nby me; whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall\r\nfor thy sake.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 22:16\r\n 16 Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in\r\nthe fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and\r\nI have created the waster to destroy.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 22:17\r\n 17 No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and\r\nevery tongue that shall revile against thee in judgment thou\r\nshalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord,\r\nand their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 23\r\nChapter 23\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 23:1\r\n 1 And now, behold, I say unto you, that ye ought to search these\r\nthings. Yea, a commandment I give unto you that ye search these\r\nthings diligently; for great are the words of Isaiah.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 23:2\r\n 2 For surely he spake as touching all things concerning my\r\npeople which are of the house of Israel; therefore it must needs\r\nbe that he must speak also to the Gentiles.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 23:3\r\n 3 And all things that he spake have been and shall be, even\r\naccording to the words which he spake.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 23:4\r\n 4 Therefore give heed to my words; write the things which I have\r\ntold you; and according to the time and the will of the Father\r\nthey shall go forth unto the Gentiles.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 23:5\r\n 5 And whosoever will hearken unto my words and repenteth and is\r\nbaptized, the same shall be saved. Search the prophets, for many\r\nthere be that testify of these things.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 23:6\r\n 6 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had said these words\r\nhe said unto them again, after he had expounded all the\r\nscriptures unto them which they had received, he said unto them:\r\nBehold, other scriptures I would that ye should write, that ye\r\nhave not.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 23:7\r\n 7 And it came to pass that he said unto Nephi: Bring forth the\r\nrecord which ye have kept.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 23:8\r\n 8 And when Nephi had brought forth the records, and laid them\r\nbefore him, he cast his eyes upon them and said:\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 23:9\r\n 9 Verily I say unto you, I commanded my servant Samuel, the\r\nLamanite, that he should testify unto this people, that at the\r\nday that the Father should glorify his name in me that there were\r\nmany saints who should arise from the dead, and should appear\r\nunto many, and should minister unto them. And he said unto them:\r\nWas it not so?\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 23:10\r\n 10 And his disciples answered him and said: Yea, Lord, Samuel\r\ndid prophesy according to thy words, and they were all fulfilled.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 23:11\r\n 11 And Jesus said unto them: How be it that ye have not written\r\nthis thing, that many saints did arise and appear unto many and\r\ndid minister unto them?\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 23:12\r\n 12 And it came to pass that Nephi remembered that this thing had\r\nnot been written.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 23:13\r\n 13 And it came to pass that Jesus commanded that it should be\r\nwritten; therefore it was written according as he commanded.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 23:14\r\n 14 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had expounded all the\r\nscriptures in one, which they had written, he commanded them that\r\nthey should teach the things which he had expounded unto them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 24\r\nChapter 24\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 24:1\r\n 1 And it came to pass that he commanded them that they should\r\nwrite the words which the Father had given unto Malachi, which he\r\nshould tell unto them. And it came to pass that after they were\r\nwritten he expounded them. And these are the words which he did\r\ntell unto them, saying: Thus said the Father unto\r\nMalachi--Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare\r\nthe way before me, and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come\r\nto his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye\r\ndelight in; behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of Hosts.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 24:2\r\n 2 But who may abide the day of his coming, and who shall stand\r\nwhen he appeareth? For he is like a refiner's fire, and like\r\nfuller's soap.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 24:3\r\n 3 And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he\r\nshall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver,\r\nthat they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 24:4\r\n 4 Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant\r\nunto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 24:5\r\n 5 And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift\r\nwitness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and\r\nagainst false swearers, and against those that oppress the\r\nhireling in his wages, the widow and the fatherless, and that\r\nturn aside the stranger, and fear not me, saith the Lord of\r\nHosts.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 24:6\r\n 6 For I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob\r\nare not consumed.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 24:7\r\n 7 Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine\r\nordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me and I will\r\nreturn unto you, saith the Lord of Hosts. But ye say: Wherein\r\nshall we return?\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 24:8\r\n 8 Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say:\r\nWherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 24:9\r\n 9 Ye are cursed with a curse, for ye have robbed me, even this\r\nwhole nation.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 24:10\r\n 10 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may\r\nbe meat in my house; and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of\r\nHosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you\r\nout a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 24:11\r\n 11 And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall\r\nnot destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine\r\ncast her fruit before the time in the fields, saith the Lord of\r\nHosts.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 24:12\r\n 12 And all nations shall call you blessed, for ye shall be a\r\ndelightsome land, saith the Lord of Hosts.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 24:13\r\n 13 Your words have been stout against me, saith the Lord. Yet\r\nye say: What have we spoken against thee?\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 24:14\r\n 14 Ye have said: It is vain to serve God, and what doth it\r\nprofit that we have kept his ordinances and that we have walked\r\nmournfully before the Lord of Hosts?\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 24:15\r\n 15 And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work\r\nwickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even\r\ndelivered.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 24:16\r\n 16 Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another,\r\nand the Lord hearkened and heard; and a book of remembrance was\r\nwritten before him for them that feared the Lord, and that\r\nthought upon his name.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 24:17\r\n 17 And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of Hosts, in that day\r\nwhen I make up my jewels; and I will spare them as a man spareth\r\nhis own son that serveth him.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 24:18\r\n 18 Then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and\r\nthe wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 25\r\nChapter 25\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 25:1\r\n 1 For behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven; and all\r\nthe proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble; and\r\nthe day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts,\r\nthat it shall leave them neither root nor branch.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 25:2\r\n 2 But unto you that fear my name, shall the Son of Righteousness\r\narise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth and grow\r\nup as calves in the stall.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 25:3\r\n 3 And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes\r\nunder the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this,\r\nsaith the Lord of Hosts.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 25:4\r\n 4 Remember ye the law of Moses, my servant, which I commanded\r\nunto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and\r\njudgments.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 25:5\r\n 5 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming\r\nof the great and dreadful day of the Lord;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 25:6\r\n 6 And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children,\r\nand the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and\r\nsmite the earth with a curse.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 26\r\nChapter 26\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 26:1\r\n 1 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had told these things\r\nhe expounded them unto the multitude; and he did expound all\r\nthings unto them, both great and small.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 26:2\r\n 2 And he saith: These scriptures, which ye had not with you, the\r\nFather commanded that I should give unto you; for it was wisdom\r\nin him that they should be given unto future generations.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 26:3\r\n 3 And he did expound all things, even from the beginning until\r\nthe time that he should come in his glory--yea, even all things\r\nwhich should come upon the face of the earth, even until the\r\nelements should melt with fervent heat, and the earth should be\r\nwrapt together as a scroll, and the heavens and the earth should\r\npass away;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 26:4\r\n 4 And even unto the great and last day, when all people, and all\r\nkindreds, and all nations and tongues shall stand before God, to\r\nbe judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be\r\nevil--\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 26:5\r\n 5 If they be good, to the resurrection of everlasting life; and\r\nif they be evil, to the resurrection of damnation; being on a\r\nparallel, the one on the one hand and the other on the other\r\nhand, according to the mercy, and the justice, and the holiness\r\nwhich is in Christ, who was before the world began.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 26:6\r\n 6 And now there cannot be written in this book even a hundredth\r\npart of the things which Jesus did truly teach unto the people;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 26:7\r\n 7 But behold the plates of Nephi do contain the more part of the\r\nthings which he taught the people.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 26:8\r\n 8 And these things have I written, which are a lesser part of\r\nthe things which he taught the people; and I have written them to\r\nthe intent that they may be brought again unto this people, from\r\nthe Gentiles, according to the words which Jesus hath spoken.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 26:9\r\n 9 And when they shall have received this, which is expedient\r\nthat they should have first, to try their faith, and if it shall\r\nso be that they shall believe these things then shall the greater\r\nthings be made manifest unto them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 26:10\r\n 10 And if it so be that they will not believe these things, then\r\nshall the greater things be withheld from them, unto their\r\ncondemnation.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 26:11\r\n 11 Behold, I was about to write them, all which were engraven\r\nupon the plates of Nephi, but the Lord forbade it, saying: I will\r\ntry the faith of my people.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 26:12\r\n 12 Therefore I, Mormon, do write the things which have been\r\ncommanded me of the Lord. And now I, Mormon, make an end of my\r\nsayings, and proceed to write the things which have been\r\ncommanded me.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 26:13\r\n 13 Therefore, I would that ye should behold that the Lord truly\r\ndid teach the people, for the space of three days; and after that\r\nhe did show himself unto them oft, and did break bread oft, and\r\nbless it, and give it unto them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 26:14\r\n 14 And it came to pass that he did teach and minister unto the\r\nchildren of the multitude of whom hath been spoken, and he did\r\nloose their tongues, and they did speak unto their fathers great\r\nand marvelous things, even greater than he had revealed unto the\r\npeople; and he loosed their tongues that they could utter.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 26:15\r\n 15 And it came to pass that after he had ascended into\r\nheaven--the second time that he showed himself unto them, and had\r\ngone unto the Father, after having healed all their sick, and\r\ntheir lame, and opened the eyes of their blind and unstopped the\r\nears of the deaf, and even had done all manner of cures among\r\nthem, and raised a man from the dead, and had shown forth his\r\npower unto them, and had ascended unto the Father--\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 26:16\r\n 16 Behold, it came to pass on the morrow that the multitude\r\ngathered themselves together, and they both saw and heard these\r\nchildren; yea, even babes did open their mouths and utter\r\nmarvelous things; and the things which they did utter were\r\nforbidden that there should not any man write them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 26:17\r\n 17 And it came to pass that the disciples whom Jesus had chosen\r\nbegan from that time forth to baptize and to teach as many as did\r\ncome unto them; and as many as were baptized in the name of Jesus\r\nwere filled with the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 26:18\r\n 18 And many of them saw and heard unspeakable things, which are\r\nnot lawful to be written.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 26:19\r\n 19 And they taught, and did minister one to another; and they\r\nhad all things common among them, every man dealing justly, one\r\nwith another.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 26:20\r\n 20 And it came to pass that they did do all things even as Jesus\r\nhad commanded them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 26:21\r\n 21 And they who were baptized in the name of Jesus were called\r\nthe church of Christ.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27\r\nChapter 27\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:1\r\n 1 And it came to pass that as the disciples of Jesus were\r\njourneying and were preaching the things which they had both\r\nheard and seen, and were baptizing in the name of Jesus, it came\r\nto pass that the disciples were gathered together and were united\r\nin mighty prayer and fasting.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:2\r\n 2 And Jesus again showed himself unto them, for they were\r\npraying unto the Father in his name; and Jesus came and stood in\r\nthe midst of them, and said unto them: What will ye that I shall\r\ngive unto you?\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:3\r\n 3 And they said unto him: Lord, we will that thou wouldst tell\r\nus the name whereby we shall call this church; for there are\r\ndisputations among the people concerning this matter.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:4\r\n 4 And the Lord said unto them: Verily, verily, I say unto you,\r\nwhy is it that the people should murmur and dispute because of\r\nthis thing?\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:5\r\n 5 Have they not read the scriptures, which say ye must take upon\r\nyou the name of Christ, which is my name? For by this name shall\r\nye be called at the last day;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:6\r\n 6 And whoso taketh upon him my name, and endureth to the end,\r\nthe same shall be saved at the last day.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:7\r\n 7 Therefore, whatsoever ye shall do, ye shall do it in my name;\r\ntherefore ye shall call the church in my name; and ye shall call\r\nupon the Father in my name that he will bless the church for my\r\nsake.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:8\r\n 8 And how be it my church save it be called in my name? For if\r\na church be called in Moses' name then it be Moses' church; or if\r\nit be called in the name of a man then it be the church of a man;\r\nbut if it be called in my name then it is my church, if it so be\r\nthat they are built upon my gospel.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:9\r\n 9 Verily I say unto you, that ye are built upon my gospel;\r\ntherefore ye shall call whatsoever things ye do call, in my name;\r\ntherefore if ye call upon the Father, for the church, if it be in\r\nmy name the Father will hear you;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:10\r\n 10 And if it so be that the church is built upon my gospel then\r\nwill the Father show forth his own works in it.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:11\r\n 11 But if it be not built upon my gospel, and is built upon the\r\nworks of men, or upon the works of the devil, verily I say unto\r\nyou they have joy in their works for a season, and by and by the\r\nend cometh, and they are hewn down and cast into the fire, from\r\nwhence there is no return.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:12\r\n 12 For their works do follow them, for it is because of their\r\nworks that they are hewn down; therefore remember the things that\r\nI have told you.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:13\r\n 13 Behold I have given unto you my gospel, and this is the\r\ngospel which I have given unto you--that I came into the world to\r\ndo the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:14\r\n 14 And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the\r\ncross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I\r\nmight draw all men unto me, that as I have been lifted up by men\r\neven so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before\r\nme, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether\r\nthey be evil--\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:15\r\n 15 And for this cause have I been lifted up; therefore,\r\naccording to the power of the Father I will draw all men unto me,\r\nthat they may be judged according to their works.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:16\r\n 16 And it shall come to pass, that whoso repenteth and is\r\nbaptized in my name shall be filled; and if he endureth to the\r\nend, behold, him will I hold guiltless before my Father at that\r\nday when I shall stand to judge the world.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:17\r\n 17 And he that endureth not unto the end, the same is he that is\r\nalso hewn down and cast into the fire, from whence they can no\r\nmore return, because of the justice of the Father.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:18\r\n 18 And this is the word which he hath given unto the children of\r\nmen. And for this cause he fulfilleth the words which he hath\r\ngiven, and he lieth not, but fulfilleth all his words.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:19\r\n 19 And no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom; therefore\r\nnothing entereth into his rest save it be those who have washed\r\ntheir garments in my blood, because of their faith, and the\r\nrepentance of all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the\r\nend.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:20\r\n 20 Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the\r\nearth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may\r\nbe sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may\r\nstand spotless before me at the last day.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:21\r\n 21 Verily, verily, I say unto you, this is my gospel; and ye\r\nknow the things that ye must do in my church; for the works which\r\nye have seen me do that shall ye also do; for that which ye have\r\nseen me do even that shall ye do;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:22\r\n 22 Therefore, if ye do these things blessed are ye, for ye shall\r\nbe lifted up at the last day.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:23\r\n 23 Write the things which ye have seen and heard, save it be\r\nthose which are forbidden.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:24\r\n 24 Write the works of this people, which shall be, even as hath\r\nbeen written, of that which hath been.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:25\r\n 25 For behold, out of the books which have been written, and\r\nwhich shall be written, shall this people be judged, for by them\r\nshall their works be known unto men.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:26\r\n 26 And behold, all things are written by the Father; therefore\r\nout of the books which shall be written shall the world be\r\njudged.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:27\r\n 27 And know ye that ye shall be judges of this people, according\r\nto the judgment which I shall give unto you, which shall be just.\r\n\r\nTherefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto\r\nyou, even as I am.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:28\r\n 28 And now I go unto the Father. And verily I say unto you,\r\nwhatsoever things ye shall ask the Father in my name shall be\r\ngiven unto you.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:29\r\n 29 Therefore, ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be\r\nopened unto you; for he that asketh, receiveth; and unto him that\r\nknocketh, it shall be opened.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:30\r\n 30 And now, behold, my joy is great, even unto fulness, because\r\nof you, and also this generation; yea, and even the Father\r\nrejoiceth, and also all the holy angels, because of you and this\r\ngeneration; for none of them are lost.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:31\r\n 31 Behold, I would that ye should understand; for I mean them\r\nwho are now alive of this generation; and none of them are lost;\r\nand in them I have fulness of joy.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:32\r\n 32 But behold, it sorroweth me because of the fourth generation\r\nfrom this generation, for they are led away captive by him even\r\nas was the son of perdition; for they will sell me for silver and\r\nfor gold, and for that which moth doth corrupt and which thieves\r\ncan break through and steal. And in that day will I visit them,\r\neven in turning their works upon their own heads.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 27:33\r\n 33 And it came to pass that when Jesus had ended these sayings\r\nhe said unto his disciples: Enter ye in at the strait gate; for\r\nstrait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leads to life, and\r\nfew there be that find it; but wide is the gate, and broad the\r\nway which leads to death, and many there be that travel therein,\r\nuntil the night cometh, wherein no man can work.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28\r\nChapter 28\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:1\r\n 1 And it came to pass when Jesus had said these words, he spake\r\nunto his disciples, one by one, saying unto them: What is it that\r\nye desire of me, after that I am gone to the Father?\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:2\r\n 2 And they all spake, save it were three, saying: We desire that\r\nafter we have lived unto the age of man, that our ministry,\r\nwherein thou hast called us, may have an end, that we may\r\nspeedily come unto thee in thy kingdom.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:3\r\n 3 And he said unto them: Blessed are ye because ye desired this\r\nthing of me; therefore, after that ye are seventy and two years\r\nold ye shall come unto me in my kingdom; and with me ye shall\r\nfind rest.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:4\r\n 4 And when he had spoken unto them, he turned himself unto the\r\nthree, and said unto them: What will ye that I should do unto\r\nyou, when I am gone unto the Father?\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:5\r\n 5 And they sorrowed in their hearts, for they durst not speak\r\nunto him the things which they desired.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:6\r\n 6 And he said unto them: Behold, I know your thoughts, and ye\r\nhave desired the thing which John, my beloved, who was with me in\r\nmy ministry, before that I was lifted up by the Jews, desired of\r\nme.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:7\r\n 7 Therefore, more blessed are ye, for ye shall never taste of\r\ndeath; but ye shall live to behold all the doings of the Father\r\nunto the children of men, even until all things shall be\r\nfulfilled according to the will of the Father, when I shall come\r\nin my glory with the powers of heaven.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:8\r\n 8 And ye shall never endure the pains of death; but when I shall\r\ncome in my glory ye shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye\r\nfrom mortality to immortality; and then shall ye be blessed in\r\nthe kingdom of my Father.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:9\r\n 9 And again, ye shall not have pain while ye shall dwell in the\r\nflesh, neither sorrow save it be for the sins of the world; and\r\nall this will I do because of the thing which ye have desired of\r\nme, for ye have desired that ye might bring the souls of men unto\r\nme, while the world shall stand.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:10\r\n 10 And for this cause ye shall have fulness of joy; and ye shall\r\nsit down in the kingdom of my Father; yea, your joy shall be\r\nfull, even as the Father hath given me fulness of joy; and ye\r\nshall be even as I am, and I am even as the Father; and the\r\nFather and I are one;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:11\r\n 11 And the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me; and\r\nthe Father giveth the Holy Ghost unto the children of men,\r\nbecause of me.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:12\r\n 12 And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words,\r\nhe touched every one of them with his finger save it were the\r\nthree who were to tarry, and then he departed.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:13\r\n 13 And behold, the heavens were opened, and they were caught up\r\ninto heaven, and saw and heard unspeakable things.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:14\r\n 14 And it was forbidden them that they should utter; neither was\r\nit given unto them power that they could utter the things which\r\nthey saw and heard;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:15\r\n 15 And whether they were in the body or out of the body, they\r\ncould not tell; for it did seem unto them like a transfiguration\r\nof them, that they were changed from this body of flesh into an\r\nimmortal state, that they could behold the things of God.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:16\r\n 16 But it came to pass that they did again minister upon the\r\nface of the earth; nevertheless they did not minister of the\r\nthings which they had heard and seen, because of the commandment\r\nwhich was given them in heaven.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:17\r\n 17 And now, whether they were mortal or immortal, from the day\r\nof their transfiguration, I know not;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:18\r\n 18 But this much I know, according to the record which hath been\r\ngiven--they did go forth upon the face of the land, and did\r\nminister unto all the people, uniting as many to the church as\r\nwould believe in their preaching; baptizing them, and as many as\r\nwere baptized did receive the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:19\r\n 19 And they were cast into prison by them who did not belong to\r\nthe church. And the prisons could not hold them, for they were\r\nrent in twain.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:20\r\n 20 And they were cast down into the earth; but they did smite\r\nthe earth with the word of God, insomuch that by his power they\r\nwere delivered out of the depths of the earth; and therefore they\r\ncould not dig pits sufficient to hold them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:21\r\n 21 And thrice they were cast into a furnace and received no\r\nharm.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:22\r\n 22 And twice were they cast into a den of wild beasts; and\r\nbehold they did play with the beasts as a child with a suckling\r\nlamb, and received no harm.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:23\r\n 23 And it came to pass that thus they did go forth among all the\r\npeople of Nephi, and did preach the gospel of Christ unto all\r\npeople upon the face of the land; and they were converted unto\r\nthe Lord, and were united unto the church of Christ, and thus the\r\npeople of that generation were blessed, according to the word of\r\nJesus.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:24\r\n 24 And now I, Mormon, make an end of speaking concerning these\r\nthings for a time.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:25\r\n 25 Behold, I was about to write the names of those who were\r\nnever to taste of death, but the Lord forbade; therefore I write\r\nthem not, for they are hid from the world.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:26\r\n 26 But behold, I have seen them, and they have ministered unto\r\nme.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:27\r\n 27 And behold they will be among the Gentiles, and the Gentiles\r\nshall know them not.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:28\r\n 28 They will also be among the Jews, and the Jews shall know\r\nthem not.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:29\r\n 29 And it shall come to pass, when the Lord seeth fit in his\r\nwisdom that they shall minister unto all the scattered tribes of\r\nIsrael, and unto all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, and\r\nshall bring out of them unto Jesus many souls, that their desire\r\nmay be fulfilled, and also because of the convincing power of God\r\nwhich is in them.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:30\r\n 30 And they are as the angels of God, and if they shall pray\r\nunto the Father in the name of Jesus they can show themselves\r\nunto whatsoever man it seemeth them good.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:31\r\n 31 Therefore, great and marvelous works shall be wrought by\r\nthem, before the great and coming day when all people must surely\r\nstand before the judgment-seat of Christ;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:32\r\n 32 Yea even among the Gentiles shall there be a great and\r\nmarvelous work wrought by them, before that judgment day.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:33\r\n 33 And if ye had all the scriptures which give an account of all\r\nthe marvelous works of Christ, ye would, according to the words\r\nof Christ, know that these things must surely come.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:34\r\n 34 And wo be unto him that will not hearken unto the words of\r\nJesus, and also to them whom he hath chosen and sent among them;\r\nfor whoso receiveth not the words of Jesus and the words of those\r\nwhom he hath sent receiveth not him; and therefore he will not\r\nreceive them at the last day;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:35\r\n 35 And it would be better for them if they had not been born.\r\nFor do ye suppose that ye can get rid of the justice of an\r\noffended God, who hath been trampled under feet of men, that\r\nthereby salvation might come?\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:36\r\n 36 And now behold, as I spake concerning those whom the Lord\r\nhath chosen, yea, even three who were caught up into the heavens,\r\nthat I knew not whether they were cleansed from mortality to\r\nimmortality--\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:37\r\n 37 But behold, since I wrote, I have inquired of the Lord, and\r\nhe hath made it manifest unto me that there must needs be a\r\nchange wrought upon their bodies, or else it needs be that they\r\nmust taste of death;\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:38\r\n 38 Therefore, that they might not taste of death there was a\r\nchange wrought upon their bodies, that they might not suffer pain\r\nnor sorrow save it were for the sins of the world.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 28:39\r\n 39 Now this change was not equal to that which shall take place\r\nat the last day; but there was a change wrought upon them,\r\ninsomuch that Satan could have no power over them, that he could\r\nnot tempt them; and they were sanctified in the flesh, that they\r\nwere holy, and that the powers of the earth could not hold them.\r\n3 Nephi 28:40\r\n 40 And in this state they were to remain until the judgment day\r\nof Christ; and at that day they were to receive a greater change,\r\nand to be received into the kingdom of the Father to go no more\r\nout, but to dwell eternally in the heavens.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 29\r\nChapter 29\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 29:1\r\n 1 And now behold, I say unto you that when the Lord shall see\r\nfit, in his wisdom, that these sayings shall come unto the\r\nGentiles according to his word, then ye may know that the\r\ncovenant which the Father hath made with the children of Israel,\r\nconcerning their restoration to the lands of their inheritance,\r\nis already beginning to be fulfilled.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 29:2\r\n 2 And ye may know that the words of the Lord, which have been\r\nspoken by the holy prophets, shall all be fulfilled; and ye need\r\nnot say that the Lord delays his coming unto the children of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 29:3\r\n 3 And ye need not imagine in your hearts that the words which\r\nhave been spoken are vain, for behold, the Lord will remember his\r\ncovenant which he hath made unto his people of the house of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 29:4\r\n 4 And when ye shall see these sayings coming forth among you,\r\nthen ye need not any longer spurn at the doings of the Lord, for\r\nthe sword of his justice is in his right hand; and behold, at\r\nthat day, if ye shall spurn at his doings he will cause that it\r\nshall soon overtake you.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 29:5\r\n 5 Wo unto him that spurneth at the doings of the Lord; yea, wo\r\nunto him that shall deny the Christ and his works!\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 29:6\r\n 6 Yea, wo unto him that shall deny the revelations of the Lord,\r\nand that shall say the Lord no longer worketh by revelation, or\r\nby prophecy, or by gifts, or by tongues, or by healings, or by\r\nthe power of the Holy Ghost!\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 29:7\r\n 7 Yea, and wo unto him that shall say at that day, to get gain,\r\nthat there can be no miracle wrought by Jesus Christ; for he that\r\ndoeth this shall become like unto the son of perdition, for whom\r\nthere was no mercy, according to the word of Christ!\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 29:8\r\n 8 Yea, and ye need not any longer hiss, nor spurn, nor make game\r\nof the Jews, nor any of the remnant of the house of Israel; for\r\nbehold, the Lord remembereth his covenant unto them, and he will\r\ndo unto them according to that which he hath sworn.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 29:9\r\n 9 Therefore ye need not suppose that ye can turn the right hand\r\nof the Lord unto the left, that he may not execute judgment unto\r\nthe fulfilling of the covenant which he hath made unto the house\r\nof Israel.\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 30\r\nChapter 30\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 30:1\r\n 1 Hearken, O ye Gentiles, and hear the words of Jesus Christ,\r\nthe Son of the living God, which he hath commanded me that I\r\nshould speak concerning you, for, behold he commandeth me that I\r\nshould write, saying:\r\n\r\n3 Nephi 30:2\r\n 2 Turn, all ye Gentiles, from your wicked ways; and repent of\r\nyour evil doings, of your lyings and deceivings, and of your\r\nwhoredoms, and of your secret abominations, and your idolatries,\r\nand of your murders, and your priestcrafts, and your envyings,\r\nand your strifes, and from all your wickedness and abominations,\r\nand come unto me, and be baptized in my name, that ye may receive\r\na remission of your sins, and be filled with the Holy Ghost, that\r\nye may be numbered with my people who are of the house of Israel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH NEPHI\r\n\r\nWHO IS THE SON OF NEPHI--ONE OF THE DISCIPLES OF JESUS CHRIST\r\nAn account of the people of Nephi, according to his record.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:1\r\n 1 And it came to pass that the thirty and fourth year passed\r\naway, and also the thirty and fifth, and behold the disciples of\r\nJesus had formed a church of Christ in all the lands round about.\r\nAnd as many as did come unto them, and did truly repent of their\r\nsins, were baptized in the name of Jesus; and they did also\r\nreceive the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:2\r\n 2 And it came to pass in the thirty and sixth year, the people\r\nwere all converted unto the Lord, upon all the face of the land,\r\nboth Nephites and Lamanites, and there were no contentions and\r\ndisputations among them, and every man did deal justly one with\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:3\r\n 3 And they had all things common among them; therefore there\r\nwere not rich and poor, bond and free, but they were all made\r\nfree, and partakers of the heavenly gift.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:4\r\n 4 And it came to pass that the thirty and seventh year passed\r\naway also, and there still continued to be peace in the land.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:5\r\n 5 And there were great and marvelous works wrought by the\r\ndisciples of Jesus, insomuch that they did heal the sick, and\r\nraise the dead, and cause the lame to walk, and the blind to\r\nreceive their sight, and the deaf to hear; and all manner of\r\nmiracles did they work among the children of men; and in nothing\r\ndid they work miracles save it were in the name of Jesus.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:6\r\n 6 And thus did the thirty and eighth year pass away, and also\r\nthe thirty and ninth, and forty and first, and the forty and\r\nsecond, yea, even until forty and nine years had passed away, and\r\nalso the fifty and first, and the fifty and second; yea, and even\r\nuntil fifty and nine years had passed away.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:7\r\n 7 And the Lord did prosper them exceedingly in the land; yea,\r\ninsomuch that they did build cities again where there had been\r\ncities burned.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:8\r\n 8 Yea, even that great city Zarahemla did they cause to be built\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:9\r\n 9 But there were many cities which had been sunk, and waters\r\ncame up in the stead thereof; therefore these cities could not be\r\nrenewed.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:10\r\n 10 And now, behold, it came to pass that the people of Nephi did\r\nwax strong, and did multiply exceedingly fast, and became an\r\nexceedingly fair and delightsome people.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:11\r\n 11 And they were married, and given in marriage, and were\r\nblessed according to the multitude of the promises which the Lord\r\nhad made unto them.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:12\r\n 12 And they did not walk any more after the performances and\r\nordinances of the law of Moses; but they did walk after the\r\ncommandments which they had received from their Lord and their\r\nGod, continuing in fasting and prayer, and in meeting together\r\noft both to pray and to hear the word of the Lord.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:13\r\n 13 And it came to pass that there was no contention among all\r\nthe people, in all the land; but there were mighty miracles\r\nwrought among the disciples of Jesus.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:14\r\n 14 And it came to pass that the seventy and first year passed\r\naway, and also the seventy and second year, yea, and in fine,\r\ntill the seventy and ninth year had passed away; yea, even an\r\nhundred years had passed away, and the disciples of Jesus, whom\r\nhe had chosen, had all gone to the paradise of God, save it were\r\nthe three who should tarry; and there were other disciples\r\nordained in their stead; and also many of that generation had\r\npassed away.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:15\r\n 15 And it came to pass that there was no contention in the land,\r\nbecause of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:16\r\n 16 And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor\r\nwhoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of\r\nlasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people\r\namong all the people who had been created by the hand of God.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:17\r\n 17 There were no robbers, nor murderers, neither were there\r\nLamanites, nor any manner of --ites; but they were in one, the\r\nchildren of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:18\r\n 18 And how blessed were they! For the Lord did bless them in\r\nall their doings; yea, even they were blessed and prospered until\r\nan hundred and ten years had passed away; and the first\r\ngeneration from Christ had passed away, and there was no\r\ncontention in all the land.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:19\r\n 19 And it came to pass that Nephi, he that kept this last\r\nrecord, (and he kept it upon the plates of Nephi) died, and his\r\nson Amos kept it in his stead; and he kept it upon the plates of\r\nNephi also.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:20\r\n 20 And he kept it eighty and four years, and there was still\r\npeace in the land, save it were a small part of the people who\r\nhad revolted from the church and taken upon them the name of\r\nLamanites; therefore there began to be Lamanites again in the\r\nland.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:21\r\n 21 And it came to pass that Amos died also, (and it was an\r\nhundred and ninety and four years from the coming of Christ) and\r\nhis son Amos kept the record in his stead; and he also kept it\r\nupon the plates of Nephi; and it was also written in the book of\r\nNephi, which is this book.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:22\r\n 22 And it came to pass that two hundred years had passed away;\r\nand the second generation had all passed away save it were a few.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:23\r\n 23 And now I, Mormon, would that ye should know that the people\r\nhad multiplied, insomuch that they were spread upon all the face\r\nof the land, and that they had become exceedingly rich, because\r\nof their prosperity in Christ.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:24\r\n 24 And now, in this two hundred and first year there began to be\r\namong them those who were lifted up in pride, such as the wearing\r\nof costly apparel, and all manner of fine pearls, and of the fine\r\nthings of the world.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:25\r\n 25 And from that time forth they did have their goods and their\r\nsubstance no more common among them.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:26\r\n 26 And they began to be divided into classes; and they began to\r\nbuild up churches unto themselves to get gain, and began to deny\r\nthe true church of Christ.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:27\r\n 27 And it came to pass that when two hundred and ten years had\r\npassed away there were many churches in the land; yea, there were\r\nmany churches which professed to know the Christ, and yet they\r\ndid deny the more parts of his gospel, insomuch that they did\r\nreceive all manner of wickedness, and did administer that which\r\nwas sacred unto him to whom it had been forbidden because of\r\nunworthiness.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:28\r\n 28 And this church did multiply exceedingly because of iniquity,\r\nand because of the power of Satan who did get hold upon their\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:29\r\n 29 And again, there was another church which denied the Christ;\r\nand they did persecute the true church of Christ, because of\r\ntheir humility and their belief in Christ; and they did despise\r\nthem because of the many miracles which were wrought among them.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:30\r\n 30 Therefore they did exercise power and authority over the\r\ndisciples of Jesus who did tarry with them, and they did cast\r\nthem into prison; but by the power of the word of God, which was\r\nin them, the prisons were rent in twain, and they went forth\r\ndoing mighty miracles among them.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:31\r\n 31 Nevertheless, and notwithstanding all these miracles, the\r\npeople did harden their hearts, and did seek to kill them, even\r\nas the Jews at Jerusalem sought to kill Jesus, according to his\r\nword.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:32\r\n 32 And they did cast them into furnaces of fire, and they came\r\nforth receiving no harm.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:33\r\n 33 And they also cast them into dens of wild beasts, and they\r\ndid play with the wild beasts even as a child with a lamb; and\r\nthey did come forth from among them, receiving no harm.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:34\r\n 34 Nevertheless, the people did harden their hearts, for they\r\nwere led by many priests and false prophets to build up many\r\nchurches, and to do all manner of iniquity. And they did smite\r\nupon the people of Jesus; but the people of Jesus did not smite\r\nagain. And thus they did dwindle in unbelief and wickedness,\r\nfrom year to year, even until two hundred and thirty years had\r\npassed away.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:35\r\n 35 And now it came to pass in this year, yea, in the two hundred\r\nand thirty and first year, there was a great division among the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:36\r\n 36 And it came to pass that in this year there arose a people\r\nwho were called the Nephites, and they were true believers in\r\nChrist; and among them there were those who were called by the\r\nLamanites--Jacobites, and Josephites, and Zoramites;\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:37\r\n 37 Therefore the true believers in Christ, and the true\r\nworshipers of Christ, (among whom were the three disciples of\r\nJesus who should tarry) were called Nephites, and Jacobites, and\r\nJosephites, and Zoramites.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:38\r\n 38 And it came to pass that they who rejected the gospel were\r\ncalled Lamanites, and Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites; and they did\r\nnot dwindle in unbelief, but they did wilfully rebel against the\r\ngospel of Christ; and they did teach their children that they\r\nshould not believe, even as their fathers, from the beginning,\r\ndid dwindle.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:39\r\n 39 And it was because of the wickedness and abomination of their\r\nfathers, even as it was in the beginning. And they were taught\r\nto hate the children of God, even as the Lamanites were taught to\r\nhate the children of Nephi from the beginning.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:40\r\n 40 And it came to pass that two hundred and forty and four years\r\nhad passed away, and thus were the affairs of the people. And\r\nthe more wicked part of the people did wax strong, and became\r\nexceedingly more numerous than were the people of God.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:41\r\n 41 And they did still continue to build up churches unto\r\nthemselves, and adorn them with all manner of precious things.\r\nAnd thus did two hundred and fifty years pass away, and also two\r\nhundred and sixty years.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:42\r\n 42 And it came to pass that the wicked part of the people began\r\nagain to build up the secret oaths and combinations of Gadianton.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:43\r\n 43 And also the people who were called the people of Nephi began\r\nto be proud in their hearts, because of their exceeding riches,\r\nand become vain like unto their brethren, the Lamanites.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:44\r\n 44 And from this time the disciples began to sorrow for the sins\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:45\r\n 45 And it came to pass that when three hundred years had passed\r\naway, both the people of Nephi and the Lamanites had become\r\nexceedingly wicked one like unto another.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:46\r\n 46 And it came to pass that the robbers of Gadianton did spread\r\nover all the face of the land; and there were none that were\r\nrighteous save it were the disciples of Jesus. And gold and\r\nsilver did they lay up in store in abundance, and did traffic in\r\nall manner of traffic.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:47\r\n 47 And it came to pass that after three hundred and five years\r\nhad passed away, (and the people did still remain in wickedness)\r\nAmos died; and his brother, Ammaron, did keep the record in his\r\nstead.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:48\r\n 48 And it came to pass that when three hundred and twenty years\r\nhad passed away, Ammaron, being constrained by the Holy Ghost,\r\ndid hide up the records which were sacred--yea, even all the\r\nsacred records which had been handed down from generation to\r\ngeneration, which were sacred--even until the three hundred and\r\ntwentieth year from the coming of Christ.\r\n\r\n4 Nephi 1:49\r\n 49 And he did hide them up unto the Lord that they might come\r\nagain unto the remnant of the house of Jacob according to the\r\nprophecies and the promises of the Lord. And thus is the end of\r\nthe record of Ammaron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOOK OF MORMON\r\n\r\nMormon 1\r\nChapter 1\r\n\r\nMormon 1:1\r\n 1 And now I, Mormon, make a record of the things which I have\r\nboth seen and heard, and call it the Book of Mormon.\r\n\r\nMormon 1:2\r\n 2 And about the time that Ammaron hid up the records unto the\r\nLord, he came unto me, (I being about ten years of age, and I\r\nbegan to be learned somewhat after the manner of the learning of\r\nmy people) and Ammaron said unto me: I perceive that thou art a\r\nsober child, and art quick to observe;\r\n\r\nMormon 1:3\r\n 3 Therefore, when ye are about twenty and four years old I would\r\nthat ye should remember the things that ye have observed\r\nconcerning this people; and when ye are of that age go to the\r\nland Antum, unto a hill which shall be called Shim; and there\r\nhave I deposited unto the Lord all the sacred engravings\r\nconcerning this people.\r\n\r\nMormon 1:4\r\n 4 And behold, ye shall take the plates of Nephi unto yourself,\r\nand the remainder shall ye leave in the place where they are; and\r\nye shall engrave on the plates of Nephi all the things that ye\r\nhave observed concerning this people.\r\n\r\nMormon 1:5\r\n 5 And I, Mormon, being a descendant of Nephi, (and my father's\r\nname was Mormon) I remembered the things which Ammaron commanded\r\nme.\r\n\r\nMormon 1:6\r\n 6 And it came to pass that I, being eleven years old, was\r\ncarried by my father into the land southward, even to the land of\r\nZarahemla.\r\n\r\nMormon 1:7\r\n 7 The whole face of the land had become covered with buildings,\r\nand the people were as numerous almost, as it were the sand of\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nMormon 1:8\r\n 8 And it came to pass in this year there began to be a war\r\nbetween the Nephites, who consisted of the Nephites and the\r\nJacobites and the Josephites and the Zoramites; and this war was\r\nbetween the Nephites, and the Lamanites and the Lemuelites and\r\nthe Ishmaelites.\r\n\r\nMormon 1:9\r\n 9 Now the Lamanites and the Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites were\r\ncalled Lamanites, and the two parties were Nephites and\r\nLamanites.\r\n\r\nMormon 1:10\r\n 10 And it came to pass that the war began to be among them in\r\nthe borders of Zarahemla, by the waters of Sidon.\r\n\r\nMormon 1:11\r\n 11 And it came to pass that the Nephites had gathered together a\r\ngreat number of men, even to exceed the number of thirty\r\nthousand. And it came to pass that they did have in this same\r\nyear a number of battles, in which the Nephites did beat the\r\nLamanites and did slay many of them.\r\n\r\nMormon 1:12\r\n 12 And it came to pass that the Lamanites withdrew their design,\r\nand there was peace settled in the land; and peace did remain for\r\nthe space of about four years, that there was no bloodshed.\r\n\r\nMormon 1:13\r\n 13 But wickedness did prevail upon the face of the whole land,\r\ninsomuch that the Lord did take away his beloved disciples, and\r\nthe work of miracles and of healing did cease because of the\r\niniquity of the people.\r\n\r\nMormon 1:14\r\n 14 And there were no gifts from the Lord, and the Holy Ghost did\r\nnot come upon any, because of their wickedness and unbelief.\r\n\r\nMormon 1:15\r\n 15 And I, being fifteen years of age and being somewhat of a\r\nsober mind, therefore I was visited of the Lord, and tasted and\r\nknew of the goodness of Jesus.\r\n\r\nMormon 1:16\r\n 16 And I did endeavor to preach unto this people, but my mouth\r\nwas shut, and I was forbidden that I should preach unto them; for\r\nbehold they had wilfully rebelled against their God; and the\r\nbeloved disciples were taken away out of the land, because of\r\ntheir iniquity.\r\n\r\nMormon 1:17\r\n 17 But I did remain among them, but I was forbidden to preach\r\nunto them, because of the hardness of their hearts; and because\r\nof the hardness of their hearts the land was cursed for their\r\nsake.\r\n\r\nMormon 1:18\r\n 18 And these Gadianton robbers, who were among the Lamanites,\r\ndid infest the land, insomuch that the inhabitants thereof began\r\nto hide up their treasures in the earth; and they became\r\nslippery, because the Lord had cursed the land, that they could\r\nnot hold them, nor retain them again.\r\n\r\nMormon 1:19\r\n 19 And it came to pass that there were sorceries, and\r\nwitchcrafts, and magics; and the power of the evil one was\r\nwrought upon all the face of the land, even unto the fulfilling\r\nof all the words of Abinadi, and also Samuel the Lamanite.\r\n\r\nMormon 2\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\nMormon 2:1\r\n 1 And it came to pass in that same year there began to be a war\r\nagain between the Nephites and the Lamanites. And\r\nnotwithstanding I being young, was large in stature; therefore\r\nthe people of Nephi appointed me that I should be their leader,\r\nor the leader of their armies.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:2\r\n 2 Therefore it came to pass that in my sixteenth year I did go\r\nforth at the head of an army of the Nephites, against the\r\nLamanites; therefore three hundred and twenty and six years had\r\npassed away.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:3\r\n 3 And it came to pass that in the three hundred and twenty and\r\nseventh year the Lamanites did come upon us with exceedingly\r\ngreat power, insomuch that they did frighten my armies; therefore\r\nthey would not fight, and they began to retreat towards the north\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:4\r\n 4 And it came to pass that we did come to the city of Angola,\r\nand we did take possession of the city, and make preparations to\r\ndefend ourselves against the Lamanites. And it came to pass that\r\nwe did fortify the city with our might; but notwithstanding all\r\nour fortifications the Lamanites did come upon us and did drive\r\nus out of the city.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:5\r\n 5 And they did also drive us forth out of the land of David.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:6\r\n 6 And we marched forth and came to the land of Joshua, which was\r\nin the borders west by the seashore.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:7\r\n 7 And it came to pass that we did gather in our people as fast\r\nas it were possible, that we might get them together in one body.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:8\r\n 8 But behold, the land was filled with robbers and with\r\nLamanites; and notwithstanding the great destruction which hung\r\nover my people, they did not repent of their evil doings;\r\ntherefore there was blood and carnage spread throughout all the\r\nface of the land, both on the part of the Nephites and also on\r\nthe part of the Lamanites; and it was one complete revolution\r\nthroughout all the face of the land.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:9\r\n 9 And now, the Lamanites had a king, and his name was Aaron; and\r\nhe came against us with an army of forty and four thousand. And\r\nbehold, I withstood him with forty and two thousand. And it came\r\nto pass that I beat him with my army that he fled before me. And\r\nbehold, all this was done, and three hundred and thirty years had\r\npassed away.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:10\r\n 10 And it came to pass that the Nephites began to repent of\r\ntheir iniquity, and began to cry even as had been prophesied by\r\nSamuel the prophet; for behold no man could keep that which was\r\nhis own, for the thieves, and the robbers, and the murderers, and\r\nthe magic art, and the witchcraft which was in the land.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:11\r\n 11 Thus there began to be a mourning and a lamentation in all\r\nthe land because of these things, and more especially among the\r\npeople of Nephi.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:12\r\n 12 And it came to pass that when I, Mormon, saw their\r\nlamentation and their mourning and their sorrow before the Lord,\r\nmy heart did begin to rejoice within me, knowing the mercies and\r\nthe long-suffering of the Lord, therefore supposing that he would\r\nbe merciful unto them that they would again become a righteous\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:13\r\n 13 But behold this my joy was vain, for their sorrowing was not\r\nunto repentance, because of the goodness of God; but it was\r\nrather the sorrowing of the damned, because the Lord would not\r\nalways suffer them to take happiness in sin.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:14\r\n 14 And they did not come unto Jesus with broken hearts and\r\ncontrite spirits, but they did curse God, and wish to die.\r\nNevertheless they would struggle with the sword for their lives.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:15\r\n 15 And it came to pass that my sorrow did return unto me again,\r\nand I saw that the day of grace was passed with them, both\r\ntemporally and spiritually; for I saw thousands of them hewn down\r\nin open rebellion against their God, and heaped up as dung upon\r\nthe face of the land. And thus three hundred and forty and four\r\nyears had passed away.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:16\r\n 16 And it came to pass that in the three hundred and forty and\r\nfifth year the Nephites did begin to flee before the Lamanites;\r\nand they were pursued until they came even to the land of Jashon,\r\nbefore it was possible to stop them in their retreat.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:17\r\n 17 And now, the city of Jashon was near the land where Ammaron\r\nhad deposited the records unto the Lord, that they might not be\r\ndestroyed. And behold I had gone according to the word of\r\nAmmaron, and taken the plates of Nephi, and did make a record\r\naccording to the words of Ammaron.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:18\r\n 18 And upon the plates of Nephi I did make a full account of all\r\nthe wickedness and abominations; but upon these plates I did\r\nforbear to make a full account of their wickedness and\r\nabominations, for behold, a continual scene of wickedness and\r\nabominations has been before mine eyes ever since I have been\r\nsufficient to behold the ways of man.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:19\r\n 19 And wo is me because of their wickedness; for my heart has\r\nbeen filled with sorrow because of their wickedness, all my days;\r\nnevertheless, I know that I shall be lifted up at the last day.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:20\r\n 20 And it came to pass that in this year the people of Nephi\r\nagain were hunted and driven. And it came to pass that we were\r\ndriven forth until we had come northward to the land which was\r\ncalled Shem.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:21\r\n 21 And it came to pass that we did fortify the city of Shem, and\r\nwe did gather in our people as much as it were possible, that\r\nperhaps we might save them from destruction.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:22\r\n 22 And it came to pass in the three hundred and forty and sixth\r\nyear they began to come upon us again.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:23\r\n 23 And it came to pass that I did speak unto my people, and did\r\nurge them with great energy, that they would stand boldly before\r\nthe Lamanites and fight for their wives, and their children, and\r\ntheir houses, and their homes.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:24\r\n 24 And my words did arouse them somewhat to vigor, insomuch that\r\nthey did not flee from before the Lamanites, but did stand with\r\nboldness against them.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:25\r\n 25 And it came to pass that we did contend with an army of\r\nthirty thousand against an army of fifty thousand. And it came\r\nto pass that we did stand before them with such firmness that\r\nthey did flee from before us.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:26\r\n 26 And it came to pass that when they had fled we did pursue\r\nthem with our armies, and did meet them again, and did beat them;\r\nnevertheless the strength of the Lord was not with us; yea, we\r\nwere left to ourselves, that the Spirit of the Lord did not abide\r\nin us; therefore we had become weak like unto our brethren.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:27\r\n 27 And my heart did sorrow because of this the great calamity of\r\nmy people, because of their wickedness and their abominations.\r\nBut behold, we did go forth against the Lamanites and the robbers\r\nof Gadianton, until we had again taken possession of the lands of\r\nour inheritance.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:28\r\n 28 And the three hundred and forty and ninth year had passed\r\naway. And in the three hundred and fiftieth year we made a\r\ntreaty with the Lamanites and the robbers of Gadianton, in which\r\nwe did get the lands of our inheritance divided.\r\n\r\nMormon 2:29\r\n 29 And the Lamanites did give unto us the land northward, yea,\r\neven to the narrow passage which led into the land southward.\r\nAnd we did give unto the Lamanites all the land southward.\r\n\r\nMormon 3\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\nMormon 3:1\r\n 1 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did not come to battle\r\nagain until ten years more had passed away. And behold, I had\r\nemployed my people, the Nephites, in preparing their lands and\r\ntheir arms against the time of battle.\r\n\r\nMormon 3:2\r\n 2 And it came to pass that the Lord did say unto me: Cry unto\r\nthis people--Repent ye, and come unto me, and be ye baptized, and\r\nbuild up again my church, and ye shall be spared.\r\n\r\nMormon 3:3\r\n 3 And I did cry unto this people, but it was in vain; and they\r\ndid not realize that it was the Lord that had spared them, and\r\ngranted unto them a chance for repentance. And behold they did\r\nharden their hearts against the Lord their God.\r\n\r\nMormon 3:4\r\n 4 And it came to pass that after this tenth year had passed\r\naway, making, in the whole, three hundred and sixty years from\r\nthe coming of Christ, the king of the Lamanites sent an epistle\r\nunto me, which gave unto me to know that they were preparing to\r\ncome again to battle against us.\r\n\r\nMormon 3:5\r\n 5 And it came to pass that I did cause my people that they\r\nshould gather themselves together at the land Desolation, to a\r\ncity which was in the borders, by the narrow pass which led into\r\nthe land southward.\r\n\r\nMormon 3:6\r\n 6 And there we did place our armies, that we might stop the\r\narmies of the Lamanites, that they might not get possession of\r\nany of our lands; therefore we did fortify against them with all\r\nour force.\r\n\r\nMormon 3:7\r\n 7 And it came to pass that in the three hundred and sixty and\r\nfirst year the Lamanites did come down to the city of Desolation\r\nto battle against us; and it came to pass that in that year we\r\ndid beat them, insomuch that they did return to their own lands\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nMormon 3:8\r\n 8 And in the three hundred and sixty and second year they did\r\ncome down again to battle. And we did beat them again, and did\r\nslay a great number of them, and their dead were cast into the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nMormon 3:9\r\n 9 And now, because of this great thing which my people, the\r\nNephites, had done, they began to boast in their own strength,\r\nand began to swear before the heavens that they would avenge\r\nthemselves of the blood of their brethren who had been slain by\r\ntheir enemies.\r\n\r\nMormon 3:10\r\n 10 And they did swear by the heavens, and also by the throne of\r\nGod, that they would go up to battle against their enemies, and\r\nwould cut them off from the face of the land.\r\n\r\nMormon 3:11\r\n 11 And it came to pass that I, Mormon, did utterly refuse from\r\nthis time forth to be a commander and a leader of this people,\r\nbecause of their wickedness and abomination.\r\n\r\nMormon 3:12\r\n 12 Behold, I had led them, notwithstanding their wickedness I\r\nhad led them many times to battle, and had loved them, according\r\nto the love of God which was in me, with all my heart; and my\r\nsoul had been poured out in prayer unto my God all the day long\r\nfor them; nevertheless, it was without faith, because of the\r\nhardness of their hearts.\r\n\r\nMormon 3:13\r\n 13 And thrice have I delivered them out of the hands of their\r\nenemies, and they have repented not of their sins.\r\n\r\nMormon 3:14\r\n 14 And when they had sworn by all that had been forbidden them\r\nby our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, that they would go up unto\r\ntheir enemies to battle, and avenge themselves of the blood of\r\ntheir brethren, behold the voice of the Lord came unto me saying:\r\n\r\nMormon 3:15\r\n 15 Vengeance is mine, and I will repay; and because this people\r\nrepented not after I had delivered them, behold, they shall be\r\ncut off from the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nMormon 3:16\r\n 16 And it came to pass that I utterly refused to go up against\r\nmine enemies; and I did even as the Lord had commanded me; and I\r\ndid stand as an idle witness to manifest unto the world the\r\nthings which I saw and heard, according to the manifestations of\r\nthe Spirit which had testified of things to come.\r\n\r\nMormon 3:17\r\n 17 Therefore I write unto you, Gentiles, and also unto you,\r\nhouse of Israel, when the work shall commence, that ye shall be\r\nabout to prepare to return to the land of your inheritance;\r\n\r\nMormon 3:18\r\n 18 Yea, behold, I write unto all the ends of the earth; yea,\r\nunto you, twelve tribes of Israel, who shall be judged according\r\nto your works by the twelve whom Jesus chose to be his disciples\r\nin the land of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nMormon 3:19\r\n 19 And I write also unto the remnant of this people, who shall\r\nalso be judged by the twelve whom Jesus chose in this land; and\r\nthey shall be judged by the other twelve whom Jesus chose in the\r\nland of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nMormon 3:20\r\n 20 And these things doth the Spirit manifest unto me; therefore\r\nI write unto you all. And for this cause I write unto you, that\r\nye may know that ye must all stand before the judgment-seat of\r\nChrist, yea, every soul who belongs to the whole human family of\r\nAdam; and ye must stand to be judged of your works, whether they\r\nbe good or evil;\r\n\r\nMormon 3:21\r\n 21 And also that ye may believe the gospel of Jesus Christ,\r\nwhich ye shall have among you; and also that the Jews, the\r\ncovenant people of the Lord, shall have other witness besides him\r\nwhom they saw and heard, that Jesus, whom they slew, was the very\r\nChrist and the very God.\r\n\r\nMormon 3:22\r\n 22 And I would that I could persuade all ye ends of the earth to\r\nrepent and prepare to stand before the judgment-seat of Christ.\r\n\r\nMormon 4\r\nChapter 4\r\n\r\nMormon 4:1\r\n 1 And now it came to pass that in the three hundred and sixty\r\nand third year the Nephites did go up with their armies to battle\r\nagainst the Lamanites, out of the land Desolation.\r\n\r\nMormon 4:2\r\n 2 And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites were\r\ndriven back again to the land of Desolation. And while they were\r\nyet weary, a fresh army of the Lamanites did come upon them; and\r\nthey had a sore battle, insomuch that the Lamanites did take\r\npossession of the city Desolation, and did slay many of the\r\nNephites, and did take many prisoners.\r\n\r\nMormon 4:3\r\n 3 And the remainder did flee and join the inhabitants of the\r\ncity Teancum. Now the city Teancum lay in the borders by the\r\nseashore; and it was also near the city Desolation.\r\n\r\nMormon 4:4\r\n 4 And it was because the armies of the Nephites went up unto the\r\nLamanites that they began to be smitten; for were it not for\r\nthat, the Lamanites could have had no power over them.\r\n\r\nMormon 4:5\r\n 5 But, behold, the judgments of God will overtake the wicked;\r\nand it is by the wicked that the wicked are punished; for it is\r\nthe wicked that stir up the hearts of the children of men unto\r\nbloodshed.\r\n\r\nMormon 4:6\r\n 6 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did make preparations\r\nto come against the city Teancum.\r\n\r\nMormon 4:7\r\n 7 And it came to pass in the three hundred and sixty and fourth\r\nyear the Lamanites did come against the city Teancum, that they\r\nmight take possession of the city Teancum also.\r\n\r\nMormon 4:8\r\n 8 And it came to pass that they were repulsed and driven back by\r\nthe Nephites. And when the Nephites saw that they had driven the\r\nLamanites they did again boast of their own strength; and they\r\nwent forth in their own might, and took possession again of the\r\ncity Desolation.\r\n\r\nMormon 4:9\r\n 9 And now all these things had been done, and there had been\r\nthousands slain on both sides, both the Nephites and the\r\nLamanites.\r\n\r\nMormon 4:10\r\n 10 And it came to pass that the three hundred and sixty and\r\nsixth year had passed away, and the Lamanites came again upon the\r\nNephites to battle; and yet the Nephites repented not of the evil\r\nthey had done, but persisted in their wickedness continually.\r\n\r\nMormon 4:11\r\n 11 And it is impossible for the tongue to describe, or for man\r\nto write a perfect description of the horrible scene of the blood\r\nand carnage which was among the people, both of the Nephites and\r\nof the Lamanites; and every heart was hardened, so that they\r\ndelighted in the shedding of blood continually.\r\n\r\nMormon 4:12\r\n 12 And there never had been so great wickedness among all the\r\nchildren of Lehi, nor even among all the house of Israel,\r\naccording to the words of the Lord, as was among this people.\r\n\r\nMormon 4:13\r\n 13 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did take possession of\r\nthe city Desolation, and this because their number did exceed the\r\nnumber of the Nephites.\r\n\r\nMormon 4:14\r\n 14 And they did also march forward against the city Teancum, and\r\ndid drive the inhabitants forth out of her, and did take many\r\nprisoners both women and children, and did offer them up as\r\nsacrifices unto their idol gods.\r\n\r\nMormon 4:15\r\n 15 And it came to pass that in the three hundred and sixty and\r\nseventh year, the Nephites being angry because the Lamanites had\r\nsacrificed their women and their children, that they did go\r\nagainst the Lamanites with exceedingly great anger, insomuch that\r\nthey did beat again the Lamanites, and drive them out of their\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nMormon 4:16\r\n 16 And the Lamanites did not come again against the Nephites\r\nuntil the three hundred and seventy and fifth year.\r\n\r\nMormon 4:17\r\n 17 And in this year they did come down against the Nephites with\r\nall their powers; and they were not numbered because of the\r\ngreatness of their number.\r\n\r\nMormon 4:18\r\n 18 And from this time forth did the Nephites gain no power over\r\nthe Lamanites, but began to be swept off by them even as a dew\r\nbefore the sun.\r\n\r\nMormon 4:19\r\n 19 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did come down against\r\nthe city Desolation; and there was an exceedingly sore battle\r\nfought in the land Desolation, in the which they did beat the\r\nNephites.\r\n\r\nMormon 4:20\r\n 20 And they fled again from before them, and they came to the\r\ncity Boaz; and there they did stand against the Lamanites with\r\nexceeding boldness, insomuch that the Lamanites did not beat them\r\nuntil they had come again the second time.\r\n\r\nMormon 4:21\r\n 21 And when they had come the second time, the Nephites were\r\ndriven and slaughtered with an exceedingly great slaughter; their\r\nwomen and their children were again sacrificed unto idols.\r\n\r\nMormon 4:22\r\n 22 And it came to pass that the Nephites did again flee from\r\nbefore them, taking all the inhabitants with them, both in towns\r\nand villages.\r\n\r\nMormon 4:23\r\n 23 And now I, Mormon, seeing that the Lamanites were about to\r\noverthrow the land, therefore I did go to the hill Shim, and did\r\ntake up all the records which Ammaron had hid up unto the Lord.\r\n\r\nMormon 5\r\nChapter 5\r\n\r\nMormon 5:1\r\n 1 And it came to pass that I did go forth among the Nephites,\r\nand did repent of the oath which I had made that I would no more\r\nassist them; and they gave me command again of their armies, for\r\nthey looked upon me as though I could deliver them from their\r\nafflictions.\r\n\r\nMormon 5:2\r\n 2 But behold, I was without hope, for I knew the judgments of\r\nthe Lord which should come upon them; for they repented not of\r\ntheir iniquities, but did struggle for their lives without\r\ncalling upon that Being who created them.\r\n\r\nMormon 5:3\r\n 3 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did come against us as\r\nwe had fled to the city of Jordan; but behold, they were driven\r\nback that they did not take the city at that time.\r\n\r\nMormon 5:4\r\n 4 And it came to pass that they came against us again, and we\r\ndid maintain the city. And there were also other cities which\r\nwere maintained by Nephites, which strongholds did cut them off\r\nthat they could not get into the country which lay before us, to\r\ndestroy the inhabitants of our land.\r\n\r\nMormon 5:5\r\n 5 And it came to pass that whatsoever lands we had passed by,\r\nand the inhabitants thereof were not gathered in, were destroyed\r\nby the Lamanites, and their towns, and villages, and cities were\r\nburned with fire; and thus three hundred and seventy and nine\r\nyears passed away.\r\n\r\nMormon 5:6\r\n 6 And it came to pass that in the three hundred and eightieth\r\nyear the Lamanites did come again against us to battle, and we\r\ndid stand against them boldly; but it was all in vain, for so\r\ngreat were their numbers that they did tread the people of the\r\nNephites under their feet.\r\n\r\nMormon 5:7\r\n 7 And it came to pass that we did again take to flight, and\r\nthose whose flight was swifter than the Lamanites' did escape,\r\nand those whose flight did not exceed the Lamanites' were swept\r\ndown and destroyed.\r\n\r\nMormon 5:8\r\n 8 And now behold, I, Mormon, do not desire to harrow up the\r\nsouls of men in casting before them such an awful scene of blood\r\nand carnage as was laid before mine eyes; but I, knowing that\r\nthese things must surely be made known, and that all things which\r\nare hid must be revealed upon the house-tops--\r\n\r\nMormon 5:9\r\n 9 And also that a knowledge of these things must come unto the\r\nremnant of these people, and also unto the Gentiles, who the Lord\r\nhath said should scatter this people, and this people should be\r\ncounted as naught among them--therefore I write a small\r\nabridgment, daring not to give a full account of the things which\r\nI have seen, because of the commandment which I have received,\r\nand also that ye might not have too great sorrow because of the\r\nwickedness of this people.\r\n\r\nMormon 5:10\r\n 10 And now behold, this I speak unto their seed, and also to the\r\nGentiles who have care for the house of Israel, that realize and\r\nknow from whence their blessings come.\r\n\r\nMormon 5:11\r\n 11 For I know that such will sorrow for the calamity of the\r\nhouse of Israel; yea, they will sorrow for the destruction of\r\nthis people; they will sorrow that this people had not repented\r\nthat they might have been clasped in the arms of Jesus.\r\n\r\nMormon 5:12\r\n 12 Now these things are written unto the remnant of the house of\r\nJacob; and they are written after this manner, because it is\r\nknown of God that wickedness will not bring them forth unto them;\r\nand they are to be hid up unto the Lord that they may come forth\r\nin his own due time.\r\n\r\nMormon 5:13\r\n 13 And this is the commandment which I have received; and\r\nbehold, they shall come forth according to the commandment of the\r\nLord, when he shall see fit, in his wisdom.\r\n\r\nMormon 5:14\r\n 14 And behold, they shall go unto the unbelieving of the Jews;\r\nand for this intent shall they go--that they may be persuaded\r\nthat Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God; that the\r\nFather may bring about, through his most Beloved, his great and\r\neternal purpose, in restoring the Jews, or all the house of\r\nIsrael, to the land of their inheritance, which the Lord their\r\nGod hath given them, unto the fulfilling of his covenant;\r\n\r\nMormon 5:15\r\n 15 And also that the seed of this people may more fully believe\r\nhis gospel, which shall go forth unto them from the Gentiles; for\r\nthis people shall be scattered, and shall become a dark, a\r\nfilthy, and a loathsome people, beyond the description of that\r\nwhich ever hath been amongst us, yea, even that which hath been\r\namong the Lamanites, and this because of their unbelief and\r\nidolatry.\r\n\r\nMormon 5:16\r\n 16 For behold, the Spirit of the Lord hath already ceased to\r\nstrive with their fathers; and they are without Christ and God in\r\nthe world; and they are driven about as chaff before the wind.\r\n\r\nMormon 5:17\r\n 17 They were once a delightsome people, and they had Christ for\r\ntheir shepherd; yea, they were led even by God the Father.\r\n\r\nMormon 5:18\r\n 18 But now, behold, they are led about by Satan, even as chaff\r\nis driven before the wind, or as a vessel is tossed about upon\r\nthe waves, without sail or anchor, or without anything wherewith\r\nto steer her; and even as she is, so are they.\r\n\r\nMormon 5:19\r\n 19 And behold, the Lord hath reserved their blessings, which\r\nthey might have received in the land, for the Gentiles who shall\r\npossess the land.\r\n\r\nMormon 5:20\r\n 20 But behold, it shall come to pass that they shall be driven\r\nand scattered by the Gentiles; and after they have been driven\r\nand scattered by the Gentiles, behold, then will the Lord\r\nremember the covenant which he made unto Abraham and unto all the\r\nhouse of Israel.\r\n\r\nMormon 5:21\r\n 21 And also the Lord will remember the prayers of the righteous,\r\nwhich have been put up unto him for them.\r\n\r\nMormon 5:22\r\n 22 And then, O ye Gentiles, how can ye stand before the power of\r\nGod, except ye shall repent and turn from your evil ways?\r\n\r\nMormon 5:23\r\n 23 Know ye not that ye are in the hands of God? Know ye not\r\nthat he hath all power, and at his great command the earth shall\r\nbe rolled together as a scroll?\r\n\r\nMormon 5:24\r\n 24 Therefore, repent ye, and humble yourselves before him, lest\r\nhe shall come out in justice against you--lest a remnant of the\r\nseed of Jacob shall go forth among you as a lion, and tear you in\r\npieces, and there is none to deliver.\r\n\r\nMormon 6\r\nChapter 6\r\n\r\nMormon 6:1\r\n 1 And now I finish my record concerning the destruction of my\r\npeople, the Nephites. And it came to pass that we did march\r\nforth before the Lamanites.\r\n\r\nMormon 6:2\r\n 2 And I, Mormon, wrote an epistle unto the king of the\r\nLamanites, and desired of him that he would grant unto us that we\r\nmight gather together our people unto the land of Cumorah, by a\r\nhill which was called Cumorah, and there we could give them\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nMormon 6:3\r\n 3 And it came to pass that the king of the Lamanites did grant\r\nunto me the thing which I desired.\r\n\r\nMormon 6:4\r\n 4 And it came to pass that we did march forth to the land of\r\nCumorah, and we did pitch our tents around about the hill\r\nCumorah; and it was in a land of many waters, rivers, and\r\nfountains; and here we had hope to gain advantage over the\r\nLamanites.\r\n\r\nMormon 6:5\r\n 5 And when three hundred and eighty and four years had passed\r\naway, we had gathered in all the remainder of our people unto the\r\nland of Cumorah.\r\n\r\nMormon 6:6\r\n 6 And it came to pass that when we had gathered in all our\r\npeople in one to the land of Cumorah, behold I, Mormon, began to\r\nbe old; and knowing it to be the last struggle of my people, and\r\nhaving been commanded of the Lord that I should not suffer the\r\nrecords which had been handed down by our fathers, which were\r\nsacred, to fall into the hands of the Lamanites, (for the\r\nLamanites would destroy them) therefore I made this record out of\r\nthe plates of Nephi, and hid up in the hill Cumorah all the\r\nrecords which had been entrusted to me by the hand of the Lord,\r\nsave it were these few plates which I gave unto my son Moroni.\r\n\r\nMormon 6:7\r\n 7 And it came to pass that my people, with their wives and their\r\nchildren, did now behold the armies of the Lamanites marching\r\ntowards them; and with that awful fear of death which fills the\r\nbreasts of all the wicked, did they await to receive them.\r\n\r\nMormon 6:8\r\n 8 And it came to pass that they came to battle against us, and\r\nevery soul was filled with terror because of the greatness of\r\ntheir numbers.\r\n\r\nMormon 6:9\r\n 9 And it came to pass that they did fall upon my people with the\r\nsword, and with the bow, and with the arrow, and with the ax, and\r\nwith all manner of weapons of war.\r\n\r\nMormon 6:10\r\n 10 And it came to pass that my men were hewn down, yea, even my\r\nten thousand who were with me, and I fell wounded in the midst;\r\nand they passed by me that they did not put an end to my life.\r\n\r\nMormon 6:11\r\n 11 And when they had gone through and hewn down all my people\r\nsave it were twenty and four of us, (among whom was my son\r\nMoroni) and we having survived the dead of our people, did behold\r\non the morrow, when the Lamanites had returned unto their camps,\r\nfrom the top of the hill Cumorah, the ten thousand of my people\r\nwho were hewn down, being led in the front by me.\r\n\r\nMormon 6:12\r\n 12 And we also beheld the ten thousand of my people who were led\r\nby my son Moroni.\r\n\r\nMormon 6:13\r\n 13 And behold, the ten thousand of Gidgiddonah had fallen, and\r\nhe also in the midst.\r\n\r\nMormon 6:14\r\n 14 And Lamah had fallen with his ten thousand; and Gilgal had\r\nfallen with his ten thousand; and Limhah had fallen with his ten\r\nthousand; and Jeneum had fallen with his ten thousand; and\r\nCumenihah, and Moronihah, and Antionum, and Shiblom, and Shem,\r\nand Josh, had fallen with their ten thousand each.\r\n\r\nMormon 6:15\r\n 15 And it came to pass that there were ten more who did fall by\r\nthe sword, with their ten thousand each; yea, even all my people,\r\nsave it were those twenty and four who were with me, and also a\r\nfew who had escaped into the south countries, and a few who had\r\ndeserted over unto the Lamanites, had fallen; and their flesh,\r\nand bones, and blood lay upon the face of the earth, being left\r\nby the hands of those who slew them to molder upon the land, and\r\nto crumble and to return to their mother earth.\r\n\r\nMormon 6:16\r\n 16 And my soul was rent with anguish, because of the slain of my\r\npeople, and I cried:\r\n\r\nMormon 6:17\r\n 17 O ye fair ones, how could ye have departed from the ways of\r\nthe Lord! O ye fair ones, how could ye have rejected that Jesus,\r\nwho stood with open arms to receive you!\r\n\r\nMormon 6:18\r\n 18 Behold, if ye had not done this, ye would not have fallen.\r\nBut behold, ye are fallen, and I mourn your loss.\r\n\r\nMormon 6:19\r\n 19 O ye fair sons and daughters, ye fathers and mothers, ye\r\nhusbands and wives, ye fair ones, how is it that ye could have\r\nfallen!\r\n\r\nMormon 6:20\r\n 20 But behold, ye are gone, and my sorrows cannot bring your\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nMormon 6:21\r\n 21 And the day soon cometh that your mortal must put on\r\nimmortality, and these bodies which are now moldering in\r\ncorruption must soon become incorruptible bodies; and then ye\r\nmust stand before the judgment-seat of Christ to be judged\r\naccording to your works and if it so be that ye are righteous,\r\nthen are ye blessed with your fathers who have gone before you.\r\n\r\nMormon 6:22\r\n 22 O that ye had repented before this great destruction had come\r\nupon you. But behold, ye are gone, and the Father, yea, the\r\nEternal Father of heaven, knoweth your state; and he doeth with\r\nyou according to his justice and mercy.\r\n\r\nMormon 7\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\nMormon 7:1\r\n 1 And now, behold, I would speak somewhat unto the remnant of\r\nthis people who are spared, if it so be that God may give unto\r\nthem my words, that they may know of the things of their fathers;\r\nyea, I speak unto you, ye remnant of the house of Israel; and\r\nthese are the words which I speak:\r\n\r\nMormon 7:2\r\n 2 Know ye that ye are of the house of Israel.\r\n\r\nMormon 7:3\r\n 3 Know ye that ye must come unto repentance, or ye cannot be\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\nMormon 7:4\r\n 4 Know ye that ye must lay down your weapons of war, and delight\r\nno more in the shedding of blood, and take them not again, save\r\nit be that God shall command you.\r\n\r\nMormon 7:5\r\n 5 Know ye that ye must come to the knowledge of your fathers,\r\nand repent of all your sins and iniquities, and believe in Jesus\r\nChrist, that he is the Son of God, and that he was slain by the\r\nJews, and by the power of the Father he hath risen again, whereby\r\nhe hath gained the victory over the grave; and also in him is the\r\nsting of death swallowed up.\r\n\r\nMormon 7:6\r\n 6 And he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead, whereby\r\nman must be raised to stand before his judgment-seat.\r\n\r\nMormon 7:7\r\n 7 And he hath brought to pass the redemption of the world,\r\nwhereby he that is found guiltless before him at the judgment day\r\nhath it given unto him to dwell in the presence of God in his\r\nkingdom, to sing ceaseless praises with the choirs above, unto\r\nthe Father, and unto the Son, and unto the Holy Ghost, which are\r\none God, in a state of happiness which hath no end.\r\n\r\nMormon 7:8\r\n 8 Therefore repent, and be baptized in the name of Jesus, and\r\nlay hold upon the gospel of Christ, which shall be set before\r\nyou, not only in this record but also in the record which shall\r\ncome unto the Gentiles from the Jews, which record shall come\r\nfrom the Gentiles unto you.\r\n\r\nMormon 7:9\r\n 9 For behold, this is written for the intent that ye may believe\r\nthat; and if ye believe that ye will believe this also; and if ye\r\nbelieve this ye will know concerning your fathers, and also the\r\nmarvelous works which were wrought by the power of God among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMormon 7:10\r\n 10 And ye will also know that ye are a remnant of the seed of\r\nJacob; therefore ye are numbered among the people of the first\r\ncovenant; and if it so be that ye believe in Christ, and are\r\nbaptized, first with water, then with fire and with the Holy\r\nGhost, following the example of our Savior, according to that\r\nwhich he hath commanded us, it shall be well with you in the day\r\nof judgment. Amen.\r\n\r\nMormon 8\r\nChapter 8\r\n\r\nMormon 8:1\r\n 1 Behold I, Moroni, do finish the record of my father, Mormon.\r\nBehold, I have but few things to write, which things I have been\r\ncommanded by my father.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:2\r\n 2 And now it came to pass that after the great and tremendous\r\nbattle at Cumorah, behold, the Nephites who had escaped into the\r\ncountry southward were hunted by the Lamanites, until they were\r\nall destroyed.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:3\r\n 3 And my father also was killed by them, and I even remain alone\r\nto write the sad tale of the destruction of my people. But\r\nbehold, they are gone, and I fulfil the commandment of my father.\r\n\r\nAnd whether they will slay me, I know not.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:4\r\n 4 Therefore I will write and hide up the records in the earth;\r\nand whither I go it mattereth not.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:5\r\n 5 Behold, my father hath made this record, and he hath written\r\nthe intent thereof. And behold, I would write it also if I had\r\nroom upon the plates, but I have not; and ore I have none, for I\r\nam alone. My father hath been slain in battle, and all my\r\nkinsfolk, and I have not friends nor whither to go; and how long\r\nthe Lord will suffer that I may live I know not.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:6\r\n 6 Behold, four hundred years have passed away since the coming\r\nof our Lord and Savior.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:7\r\n 7 And behold, the Lamanites have hunted my people, the Nephites,\r\ndown from city to city and from place to place, even until they\r\nare no more; and great has been their fall; yea, great and\r\nmarvelous is the destruction of my people, the Nephites.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:8\r\n 8 And behold, it is the hand of the Lord which hath done it.\r\nAnd behold also, the Lamanites are at war one with another; and\r\nthe whole face of this land is one continual round of murder and\r\nbloodshed; and no one knoweth the end of the war.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:9\r\n 9 And now, behold, I say no more concerning them, for there are\r\nnone save it be the Lamanites and robbers that do exist upon the\r\nface of the land.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:10\r\n 10 And there are none that do know the true God save it be the\r\ndisciples of Jesus, who did tarry in the land until the\r\nwickedness of the people was so great that the Lord would not\r\nsuffer them to remain with the people; and whether they be upon\r\nthe face of the land no man knoweth.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:11\r\n 11 But behold, my father and I have seen them, and they have\r\nministered unto us.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:12\r\n 12 And whoso receiveth this record, and shall not condemn it\r\nbecause of the imperfections which are in it, the same shall know\r\nof greater things than these. Behold, I am Moroni; and were it\r\npossible, I would make all things known unto you.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:13\r\n 13 Behold, I make an end of speaking concerning this people. I\r\nam the son of Mormon, and my father was a descendant of Nephi.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:14\r\n 14 And I am the same who hideth up this record unto the Lord;\r\nthe plates thereof are of no worth, because of the commandment of\r\nthe Lord. For he truly saith that no one shall have them to get\r\ngain; but the record thereof is of great worth; and whoso shall\r\nbring it to light, him will the Lord bless.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:15\r\n 15 For none can have power to bring it to light save it be given\r\nhim of God; for God wills that it shall be done with an eye\r\nsingle to his glory, or the welfare of the ancient and long\r\ndispersed covenant people of the Lord.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:16\r\n 16 And blessed be he that shall bring this thing to light; for\r\nit shall be brought out of darkness unto light, according to the\r\nword of God; yea, it shall be brought out of the earth, and it\r\nshall shine forth out of darkness, and come unto the knowledge of\r\nthe people; and it shall be done by the power of God.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:17\r\n 17 And if there be faults they be the faults of a man. But\r\nbehold, we know no fault; nevertheless God knoweth all things;\r\ntherefore, he that condemneth, let him be aware lest he shall be\r\nin danger of hell fire.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:18\r\n 18 And he that saith: Show unto me, or ye shall be smitten--let\r\nhim beware lest he commandeth that which is forbidden of the\r\nLord.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:19\r\n 19 For behold, the same that judgeth rashly shall be judged\r\nrashly again; for according to his works shall his wages be;\r\ntherefore, he that smiteth shall be smitten again, of the Lord.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:20\r\n 20 Behold what the scripture says--man shall not smite, neither\r\nshall he judge; for judgment is mine, saith the Lord, and\r\nvengeance is mine also, and I will repay.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:21\r\n 21 And he that shall breathe out wrath and strifes against the\r\nwork of the Lord, and against the covenant people of the Lord who\r\nare the house of Israel, and shall say: We will destroy the work\r\nof the Lord, and the Lord will not remember his covenant which he\r\nhath made unto the house of Israel--the same is in danger to be\r\nhewn down and cast into the fire;\r\n\r\nMormon 8:22\r\n 22 For the eternal purposes of the Lord shall roll on, until all\r\nhis promises shall be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:23\r\n 23 Search the prophecies of Isaiah. Behold, I cannot write\r\nthem. Yea, behold I say unto you, that those saints who have\r\ngone before me, who have possessed this land, shall cry, yea,\r\neven from the dust will they cry unto the Lord; and as the Lord\r\nliveth he will remember the covenant which he hath made with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:24\r\n 24 And he knoweth their prayers, that they were in behalf of\r\ntheir brethren. And he knoweth their faith, for in his name\r\ncould they remove mountains; and in his name could they cause the\r\nearth to shake; and by the power of his word did they cause\r\nprisons to tumble to the earth; yea, even the fiery furnace could\r\nnot harm them, neither wild beasts nor poisonous serpents,\r\nbecause of the power of his word.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:25\r\n 25 And behold, their prayers were also in behalf of him that the\r\nLord should suffer to bring these things forth.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:26\r\n 26 And no one need say they shall not come, for they surely\r\nshall, for the Lord hath spoken it; for out of the earth shall\r\nthey come, by the hand of the Lord, and none can stay it; and it\r\nshall come in a day when it shall be said that miracles are done\r\naway; and it shall come even as if one should speak from the\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:27\r\n 27 And it shall come in a day when the blood of saints shall cry\r\nunto the Lord, because of secret combinations and the works of\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:28\r\n 28 Yea, it shall come in a day when the power of God shall be\r\ndenied, and churches become defiled and be lifted up in the pride\r\nof their hearts; yea, even in a day when leaders of churches and\r\nteachers shall rise in the pride of their hearts, even to the\r\nenvying of them who belong to their churches.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:29\r\n 29 Yea, it shall come in a day when there shall be heard of\r\nfires, and tempests, and vapors of smoke in foreign lands;\r\n\r\nMormon 8:30\r\n 30 And there shall also be heard of wars, rumors of wars, and\r\nearthquakes in divers places.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:31\r\n 31 Yea, it shall come in a day when there shall be great\r\npollutions upon the face of the earth; there shall be murders,\r\nand robbing, and lying, and deceivings, and whoredoms, and all\r\nmanner of abominations; when there shall be many who will say, Do\r\nthis, or do that, and it mattereth not, for the Lord will uphold\r\nsuch at the last day. But wo unto such for they are in the gall\r\nof bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:32\r\n 32 Yea, it shall come in a day when there shall be churches\r\nbuilt up that shall say: Come unto me, and for your money you\r\nshall be forgiven of your sins.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:33\r\n 33 O ye wicked and perverse and stiffnecked people, why have ye\r\nbuilt up churches unto yourselves to get gain? Why have ye\r\ntransfigured the holy word of God, that ye might bring damnation\r\nupon your souls? Behold, look ye unto the revelations of God;\r\nfor behold, the time cometh at that day when all these things\r\nmust be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:34\r\n 34 Behold, the Lord hath shown unto me great and marvelous\r\nthings concerning that which must shortly come, at that day when\r\nthese things shall come forth among you.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:35\r\n 35 Behold, I speak unto you as if ye were present, and yet ye\r\nare not. But behold, Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me, and I\r\nknow your doing.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:36\r\n 36 And I know that ye do walk in the pride of your hearts; and\r\nthere are none save a few only who do not lift themselves up in\r\nthe pride of their hearts, unto the wearing of very fine apparel,\r\nunto envying, and strifes, and malice, and persecutions, and all\r\nmanner of iniquities; and your churches, yea, even every one,\r\nhave become polluted because of the pride of your hearts.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:37\r\n 37 For behold, ye do love money, and your substance, and your\r\nfine apparel, and the adorning of your churches, more than ye\r\nlove the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted.\r\n\r\nMormon 8:38\r\n 38 O ye pollutions, ye hypocrites, ye teachers, who sell\r\nyourselves for that which will canker, why have ye polluted the\r\nholy church of God? Why are ye ashamed to take upon you the name\r\nof Christ? Why do ye not think that greater is the value of an\r\nendless happiness than that misery which never dies--because of\r\nthe praise of the world?\r\n\r\nMormon 8:39\r\n 39 Why do ye adorn yourselves with that which hath no life, and\r\nyet suffer the hungry, and the needy, and the naked, and the sick\r\nand the afflicted to pass by you, and notice them not?\r\n\r\nMormon 8:40\r\n 40 Yea, why do ye build up your secret abominations to get gain,\r\nand cause that widows should mourn before the Lord, and also\r\norphans to mourn before the Lord, and also the blood of their\r\nfathers and their husbands to cry unto the Lord from the ground,\r\nfor vengeance upon your heads?\r\n\r\nMormon 8:41\r\n 41 Behold, the sword of vengeance hangeth over you; and the time\r\nsoon cometh that he avengeth the blood of the saints upon you,\r\nfor he will not suffer their cries any longer.\r\n\r\nMormon 9\r\nChapter 9\r\n\r\nMormon 9:1\r\n 1 And now, I speak also concerning those who do not believe in\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:2\r\n 2 Behold, will ye believe in the day of your visitation--behold,\r\nwhen the Lord shall come, yea, even that great day when the earth\r\nshall be rolled together as a scroll, and the elements shall melt\r\nwith fervent heat, yea, in that great day when ye shall be\r\nbrought to stand before the Lamb of God--then will ye say that\r\nthere is no God?\r\n\r\nMormon 9:3\r\n 3 Then will ye longer deny the Christ, or can ye behold the Lamb\r\nof God? Do ye suppose that ye shall dwell with him under a\r\nconsciousness of your guilt? Do ye suppose that ye could be\r\nhappy to dwell with that holy Being, when your souls are racked\r\nwith a consciousness of guilt that ye have ever abused his laws?\r\n\r\nMormon 9:4\r\n 4 Behold, I say unto you that ye would be more miserable to\r\ndwell with a holy and just God, under a consciousness of your\r\nfilthiness before him, than ye would to dwell with the damned\r\nsouls in hell.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:5\r\n 5 For behold, when ye shall be brought to see your nakedness\r\nbefore God, and also the glory of God, and the holiness of Jesus\r\nChrist, it will kindle a flame of unquenchable fire upon you.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:6\r\n 6 O then ye unbelieving, turn ye unto the Lord; cry mightily\r\nunto the Father in the name of Jesus, that perhaps ye may be\r\nfound spotless, pure, fair, and white, having been cleansed by\r\nthe blood of the Lamb, at that great and last day.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:7\r\n 7 And again I speak unto you who deny the revelations of God,\r\nand say that they are done away, that there are no revelations,\r\nnor prophecies, nor gifts, nor healing, nor speaking with\r\ntongues, and the interpretation of tongues;\r\n\r\nMormon 9:8\r\n 8 Behold I say unto you, he that denieth these things knoweth\r\nnot the gospel of Christ; yea, he has not read the scriptures; if\r\nso, he does not understand them.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:9\r\n 9 For do we not read that God is the same yesterday, today, and\r\nforever, and in him there is no variableness neither shadow of\r\nchanging?\r\n\r\nMormon 9:10\r\n 10 And now if ye have imagined up unto yourselves a god who doth\r\nvary, and in whom there is shadow of changing, then have ye\r\nimagined up unto yourselves a god who is not God of miracles.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:11\r\n 11 But behold, I will show unto you a God of miracles, even the\r\nGod of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and\r\nit is that same God who created the heavens and the earth, and\r\nall things that in them are.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:12\r\n 12 Behold he created Adam, and by Adam came the fall of man.\r\nAnd because of the fall of man came Jesus Christ, even the Father\r\nand the Son; and because of Jesus Christ came the redemption of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:13\r\n 13 And because of the redemption of man, which came by Jesus\r\nChrist, they are brought back into the presence of the Lord; yea,\r\nthis is wherein all men are redeemed, because the death of Christ\r\nbringeth to pass the resurrection, which bringeth to pass a\r\nredemption from an endless sleep, from which sleep all men shall\r\nbe awakened by the power of God when the trump shall sound; and\r\nthey shall come forth, both small and great, and all shall stand\r\nbefore his bar, being redeemed and loosed from this eternal band\r\nof death, which death is a temporal death.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:14\r\n 14 And then cometh the judgment of the Holy One upon them; and\r\nthen cometh the time that he that is filthy shall be filthy\r\nstill; and he that is righteous shall be righteous still; he that\r\nis happy shall be happy still; and he that is unhappy shall be\r\nunhappy still.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:15\r\n 15 And now, O all ye that have imagined up unto yourselves a god\r\nwho can do no miracles, I would ask of you, have all these things\r\npassed, of which I have spoken? Has the end come yet? Behold I\r\nsay unto you, Nay; and God has not ceased to be a God of\r\nmiracles.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:16\r\n 16 Behold, are not the things that God hath wrought marvelous in\r\nour eyes? Yea, and who can comprehend the marvelous works of\r\nGod?\r\n\r\nMormon 9:17\r\n 17 Who shall say that it was not a miracle that by his word the\r\nheaven and the earth should be; and by the power of his word man\r\nwas created of the dust of the earth; and by the power of his\r\nword have miracles been wrought?\r\n\r\nMormon 9:18\r\n 18 And who shall say that Jesus Christ did not many mighty\r\nmiracles? And there were many mighty miracles wrought by the\r\nhands of the apostles.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:19\r\n 19 And if there were miracles wrought then, why has God ceased\r\nto be a God of miracles and yet be an unchangeable Being? And\r\nbehold, I say unto you he changeth not; if so he would cease to\r\nbe God; and he ceaseth not to be God, and is a God of miracles.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:20\r\n 20 And the reason why he ceaseth to do miracles among the\r\nchildren of men is because that they dwindle in unbelief, and\r\ndepart from the right way, and know not the God in whom they\r\nshould trust.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:21\r\n 21 Behold, I say unto you that whoso believeth in Christ,\r\ndoubting nothing, whatsoever he shall ask the Father in the name\r\nof Christ it shall be granted him; and this promise is unto all,\r\neven unto the ends of the earth.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:22\r\n 22 For behold, thus said Jesus Christ, the Son of God, unto his\r\ndisciples who should tarry, yea, and also to all his disciples,\r\nin the hearing of the multitude: Go ye into all the world, and\r\npreach the gospel to every creature;\r\n\r\nMormon 9:23\r\n 23 And he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he\r\nthat believeth not shall be damned;\r\n\r\nMormon 9:24\r\n 24 And these signs shall follow them that believe--in my name\r\nshall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;\r\nthey shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing\r\nit shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick and they\r\nshall recover;\r\n\r\nMormon 9:25\r\n 25 And whosoever shall believe in my name, doubting nothing,\r\nunto him will I confirm all my words, even unto the ends of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:26\r\n 26 And now, behold, who can stand against the works of the Lord?\r\n\r\nWho can deny his sayings? Who will rise up against the almighty\r\npower of the Lord? Who will despise the works of the Lord? Who\r\nwill despise the children of Christ? Behold, all ye who are\r\ndespisers of the works of the Lord, for ye shall wonder and\r\nperish.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:27\r\n 27 O then despise not, and wonder not, but hearken unto the\r\nwords of the Lord, and ask the Father in the name of Jesus for\r\nwhat things soever ye shall stand in need. Doubt not, but be\r\nbelieving, and begin as in times of old, and come unto the Lord\r\nwith all your heart, and work out your own salvation with fear\r\nand trembling before him.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:28\r\n 28 Be wise in the days of your probation; strip yourselves of\r\nall uncleanness; ask not, that ye may consume it on your lusts,\r\nbut ask with a firmness unshaken, that ye will yield to no\r\ntemptation, but that ye will serve the true and living God.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:29\r\n 29 See that ye are not baptized unworthily; see that ye partake\r\nnot of the sacrament of Christ unworthily; but see that ye do all\r\nthings in worthiness, and do it in the name of Jesus Christ, the\r\nSon of the living God; and if ye do this, and endure to the end,\r\nye will in nowise be cast out.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:30\r\n 30 Behold, I speak unto you as though I spake from the dead; for\r\nI know that ye shall have my words.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:31\r\n 31 Condemn me not because of mine imperfection, neither my\r\nfather, because of his imperfection, neither them who have\r\nwritten before him; but rather give thanks unto God that he hath\r\nmade manifest unto you our imperfections, that ye may learn to be\r\nmore wise than we have been.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:32\r\n 32 And now, behold, we have written this record according to our\r\nknowledge, in the characters which are called among us the\r\nreformed Egyptian, being handed down and altered by us, according\r\nto our manner of speech.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:33\r\n 33 And if our plates had been sufficiently large we should have\r\nwritten in Hebrew; but the Hebrew hath been altered by us also;\r\nand if we could have written in Hebrew, behold, ye would have had\r\nno imperfection in our record.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:34\r\n 34 But the Lord knoweth the things which we have written, and\r\nalso that none other people knoweth our language; and because\r\nthat none other people knoweth our language, therefore he hath\r\nprepared means for the interpretation thereof.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:35\r\n 35 And these things are written that we may rid our garments of\r\nthe blood of our brethren, who have dwindled in unbelief.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:36\r\n 36 And behold, these things which we have desired concerning our\r\nbrethren, yea, even their restoration to the knowledge of Christ,\r\nare according to the prayers of all the saints who have dwelt in\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nMormon 9:37\r\n 37 And may the Lord Jesus Christ grant that their prayers may be\r\nanswered according to their faith; and may God the Father\r\nremember the covenant which he hath made with the house of\r\nIsrael; and may he bless them forever, through faith on the name\r\nof Jesus Christ. Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOOK OF ETHER\r\n\r\nThe record of the Jaredites, taken from the twenty-four plates\r\nfound by the people of Limhi in the days of king Mosiah.\r\n\r\nEther 1\r\nChapter 1\r\n\r\nEther 1:1\r\n 1 And now I, Moroni, proceed to give an account of those ancient\r\ninhabitants who were destroyed by the hand of the Lord upon the\r\nface of this north country.\r\n\r\nEther 1:2\r\n 2 And I take mine account from the twenty and four plates which\r\nwere found by the people of Limhi, which is called the Book of\r\nEther.\r\n\r\nEther 1:3\r\n 3 And as I suppose that the first part of this record, which\r\nspeaks concerning the creation of the world, and also of Adam,\r\nand an account from that time even to the great tower, and\r\nwhatsoever things transpired among the children of men until that\r\ntime, is had among the Jews--\r\n\r\nEther 1:4\r\n 4 Therefore I do not write those things which transpired from\r\nthe days of Adam until that time; but they are had upon the\r\nplates; and whoso findeth them, the same will have power that he\r\nmay get the full account.\r\n\r\nEther 1:5\r\n 5 But behold, I give not the full account, but a part of the\r\naccount I give, from the tower down until they were destroyed.\r\n\r\nEther 1:6\r\n 6 And on this wise do I give the account. He that wrote this\r\nrecord was Ether, and he was a descendant of Coriantor.\r\n\r\nEther 1:7\r\n 7 Coriantor was the son of Moron.\r\n\r\nEther 1:8\r\n 8 And Moron was the son of Ethem.\r\n\r\nEther 1:9\r\n 9 And Ethem was the son of Ahah.\r\n\r\nEther 1:10\r\n 10 And Ahah was the son of Seth.\r\n\r\nEther 1:11\r\n 11 And Seth was the son of Shiblon.\r\n\r\nEther 1:12\r\n 12 And Shiblon was the son of Com.\r\n\r\nEther 1:13\r\n 13 And Com was the son of Coriantum.\r\n\r\nEther 1:14\r\n 14 And Coriantum was the son of Amnigaddah.\r\n\r\nEther 1:15\r\n 15 And Amnigaddah was the son of Aaron.\r\n\r\nEther 1:16\r\n 16 And Aaron was a descendant of Heth, who was the son of\r\nHearthom.\r\n\r\nEther 1:17\r\n 17 And Hearthom was the son of Lib.\r\n\r\nEther 1:18\r\n 18 And Lib was the son of Kish.\r\n\r\nEther 1:19\r\n 19 And Kish was the son of Corom.\r\n\r\nEther 1:20\r\n 20 And Corom was the son of Levi.\r\n\r\nEther 1:21\r\n 21 And Levi was the son of Kim.\r\n\r\nEther 1:22\r\n 22 And Kim was the son of Morianton.\r\n\r\nEther 1:23\r\n 23 And Morianton was a descendant of Riplakish.\r\n\r\nEther 1:24\r\n 24 And Riplakish was the son of Shez.\r\n\r\nEther 1:25\r\n 25 And Shez was the son of Heth.\r\n\r\nEther 1:26\r\n 26 And Heth was the son of Com.\r\n\r\nEther 1:27\r\n 27 And Com was the son of Coriantum.\r\n\r\nEther 1:28\r\n 28 And Coriantum was the son of Emer.\r\n\r\nEther 1:29\r\n 29 And Emer was the son of Omer.\r\n\r\nEther 1:30\r\n 30 And Omer was the son of Shule.\r\n\r\nEther 1:31\r\n 31 And Shule was the son of Kib.\r\n\r\nEther 1:32\r\n 32 And Kib was the son of Orihah, who was the son of Jared;\r\n\r\nEther 1:33\r\n 33 Which Jared came forth with his brother and their families,\r\nwith some others and their families, from the great tower, at the\r\ntime the Lord confounded the language of the people, and swore in\r\nhis wrath that they should be scattered upon all the face of the\r\nearth; and according to the word of the Lord the people were\r\nscattered.\r\n\r\nEther 1:34\r\n 34 And the brother of Jared being a large and mighty man, and a\r\nman highly favored of the Lord, Jared, his brother, said unto\r\nhim: Cry unto the Lord, that he will not confound us that we may\r\nnot understand our words.\r\n\r\nEther 1:35\r\n 35 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did cry unto\r\nthe Lord, and the Lord had compassion upon Jared; therefore he\r\ndid not confound the language of Jared; and Jared and his brother\r\nwere not confounded.\r\n\r\nEther 1:36\r\n 36 Then Jared said unto his brother: Cry again unto the Lord,\r\nand it may be that he will turn away his anger from them who are\r\nour friends, that he confound not their language.\r\n\r\nEther 1:37\r\n 37 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did cry unto\r\nthe Lord, and the Lord had compassion upon their friends and\r\ntheir families also, that they were not confounded.\r\n\r\nEther 1:38\r\n 38 And it came to pass that Jared spake again unto his brother,\r\nsaying: Go and inquire of the Lord whether he will drive us out\r\nof the land, and if he will drive us out of the land, cry unto\r\nhim whither we shall go. And who knoweth but the Lord will carry\r\nus forth into a land which is choice above all the earth? And if\r\nit so be, let us be faithful unto the Lord, that we may receive\r\nit for our inheritance.\r\n\r\nEther 1:39\r\n 39 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did cry unto\r\nthe Lord according to that which had been spoken by the mouth of\r\nJared.\r\n\r\nEther 1:40\r\n 40 And it came to pass that the Lord did hear the brother of\r\nJared, and had compassion upon him, and said unto him:\r\n\r\nEther 1:41\r\n 41 Go to and gather together thy flocks, both male and female,\r\nof every kind; and also of the seed of the earth of every kind;\r\nand thy families; and also Jared thy brother and his family; and\r\nalso thy friends and their families, and the friends of Jared and\r\ntheir families.\r\n\r\nEther 1:42\r\n 42 And when thou hast done this thou shalt go at the head of\r\nthem down into the valley which is northward. And there will I\r\nmeet thee, and I will go before thee into a land which is choice\r\nabove all the lands of the earth.\r\n\r\nEther 1:43\r\n 43 And there will I bless thee and thy seed, and raise up unto\r\nme of thy seed, and of the seed of thy brother, and they who\r\nshall go with thee, a great nation. And there shall be none\r\ngreater than the nation which I will raise up unto me of thy\r\nseed, upon all the face of the earth. And thus I will do unto\r\nthee because this long time ye have cried unto me.\r\n\r\nEther 2\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\nEther 2:1\r\n 1 And it came to pass that Jared and his brother, and their\r\nfamilies, and also the friends of Jared and his brother and their\r\nfamilies, went down into the valley which was northward, (and the\r\nname of the valley was Nimrod, being called after the mighty\r\nhunter) with their flocks which they had gathered together, male\r\nand female, of every kind.\r\n\r\nEther 2:2\r\n 2 And they did also lay snares and catch fowls of the air; and\r\nthey did also prepare a vessel, in which they did carry with them\r\nthe fish of the waters.\r\n\r\nEther 2:3\r\n 3 And they did also carry with them deseret, which, by\r\ninterpretation, is a honey bee; and thus they did carry with them\r\nswarms of bees, and all manner of that which was upon the face of\r\nthe land, seeds of every kind.\r\n\r\nEther 2:4\r\n 4 And it came to pass that when they had come down into the\r\nvalley of Nimrod the Lord came down and talked with the brother\r\nof Jared; and he was in a cloud, and the brother of Jared saw him\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nEther 2:5\r\n 5 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded them that they\r\nshould go forth into the wilderness, yea, into that quarter where\r\nthere never had man been. And it came to pass that the Lord did\r\ngo before them, and did talk with them as he stood in a cloud,\r\nand gave directions whither they should travel.\r\n\r\nEther 2:6\r\n 6 And it came to pass that they did travel in the wilderness,\r\nand did build barges, in which they did cross many waters, being\r\ndirected continually by the hand of the Lord.\r\n\r\nEther 2:7\r\n 7 And the Lord would not suffer that they should stop beyond the\r\nsea in the wilderness, but he would that they should come forth\r\neven unto the land of promise, which was choice above all other\r\nlands, which the Lord God had preserved for a righteous people.\r\n\r\nEther 2:8\r\n 8 And he had sworn in his wrath unto the brother of Jared, that\r\nwhoso should possess this land of promise, from that time\r\nhenceforth and forever, should serve him, the true and only God,\r\nor they should be swept off when the fulness of his wrath should\r\ncome upon them.\r\n\r\nEther 2:9\r\n 9 And now, we can behold the decrees of God concerning this\r\nland, that it is a land of promise; and whatsoever nation shall\r\npossess it shall serve God, or they shall be swept off when the\r\nfulness of his wrath shall come upon them. And the fulness of\r\nhis wrath cometh upon them when they are ripened in iniquity.\r\n\r\nEther 2:10\r\n 10 For behold, this is a land which is choice above all other\r\nlands; wherefore he that doth possess it shall serve God or shall\r\nbe swept off; for it is the everlasting decree of God. And it is\r\nnot until the fulness of iniquity among the children of the land,\r\nthat they are swept off.\r\n\r\nEther 2:11\r\n 11 And this cometh unto you, O ye Gentiles, that ye may know the\r\ndecrees of God--that ye may repent, and not continue in your\r\niniquities until the fulness come, that ye may not bring down the\r\nfulness of the wrath of God upon you as the inhabitants of the\r\nland have hitherto done.\r\n\r\nEther 2:12\r\n 12 Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall\r\npossess it shall be free from bondage, and from captivity, and\r\nfrom all other nations under heaven, if they will but serve the\r\nGod of the land, who is Jesus Christ, who hath been manifested by\r\nthe things which we have written.\r\n\r\nEther 2:13\r\n 13 And now I proceed with my record; for behold, it came to pass\r\nthat the Lord did bring Jared and his brethren forth even to that\r\ngreat sea which divideth the lands. And as they came to the sea\r\nthey pitched their tents; and they called the name of the place\r\nMoriancumer; and they dwelt in tents, and dwelt in tents upon the\r\nseashore for the space of four years.\r\n\r\nEther 2:14\r\n 14 And it came to pass at the end of four years that the Lord\r\ncame again unto the brother of Jared, and stood in a cloud and\r\ntalked with him. And for the space of three hours did the Lord\r\ntalk with the brother of Jared, and chastened him because he\r\nremembered not to call upon the name of the Lord.\r\n\r\nEther 2:15\r\n 15 And the brother of Jared repented of the evil which he had\r\ndone, and did call upon the name of the Lord for his brethren who\r\nwere with him. And the Lord said unto him: I will forgive thee\r\nand thy brethren of their sins; but thou shalt not sin any more,\r\nfor ye shall remember that my Spirit will not always strive with\r\nman; wherefore, if ye will sin until ye are fully ripe ye shall\r\nbe cut off from the presence of the Lord. And these are my\r\nthoughts upon the land which I shall give you for your\r\ninheritance; for it shall be a land choice above all other lands.\r\n\r\nEther 2:16\r\n 16 And the Lord said: Go to work and build, after the manner of\r\nbarges which ye have hitherto built. And it came to pass that\r\nthe brother of Jared did go to work, and also his brethren, and\r\nbuilt barges after the manner which they had built, according to\r\nthe instructions of the Lord. And they were small, and they were\r\nlight upon the water, even like unto the lightness of a fowl upon\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nEther 2:17\r\n 17 And they were built after a manner that they were exceedingly\r\ntight, even that they would hold water like unto a dish; and the\r\nbottom thereof was tight like unto a dish; and the sides thereof\r\nwere tight like unto a dish; and the ends thereof were peaked;\r\nand the top thereof was tight like unto a dish; and the length\r\nthereof was the length of a tree; and the door thereof, when it\r\nwas shut, was tight like unto a dish.\r\n\r\nEther 2:18\r\n 18 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared cried unto the\r\nLord, saying: O Lord, I have performed the work which thou hast\r\ncommanded me, and I have made the barges according as thou hast\r\ndirected me.\r\n\r\nEther 2:19\r\n 19 And behold, O Lord, in them there is no light; whither shall\r\nwe steer? And also we shall perish, for in them we cannot\r\nbreathe, save it is the air which is in them; therefore we shall\r\nperish.\r\n\r\nEther 2:20\r\n 20 And the Lord said unto the brother of Jared: Behold, thou\r\nshalt make a hole in the top, and also in the bottom; and when\r\nthou shalt suffer for air thou shalt unstop the hole and receive\r\nair. And if it be so that the water come in upon thee, behold,\r\nye shall stop the hole, that ye may not perish in the flood.\r\n\r\nEther 2:21\r\n 21 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did so,\r\naccording as the Lord had commanded.\r\n\r\nEther 2:22\r\n 22 And he cried again unto the Lord saying: O Lord, behold I\r\nhave done even as thou hast commanded me; and I have prepared the\r\nvessels for my people, and behold there is no light in them.\r\nBehold, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that we shall cross this great\r\nwater in darkness?\r\n\r\nEther 2:23\r\n 23 And the Lord said unto the brother of Jared: What will ye\r\nthat I should do that ye may have light in your vessels? For\r\nbehold, ye cannot have windows, for they will be dashed in\r\npieces; neither shall ye take fire with you, for ye shall not go\r\nby the light of fire.\r\n\r\nEther 2:24\r\n 24 For behold, ye shall be as a whale in the midst of the sea;\r\nfor the mountain waves shall dash upon you. Nevertheless, I will\r\nbring you up again out of the depths of the sea; for the winds\r\nhave gone forth out of my mouth, and also the rains and the\r\nfloods have I sent forth.\r\n\r\nEther 2:25\r\n 25 And behold, I prepare you against these things; for ye cannot\r\ncross this great deep save I prepare you against the waves of the\r\nsea, and the winds which have gone forth, and the floods which\r\nshall come. Therefore what will ye that I should prepare for you\r\nthat ye may have light when ye are swallowed up in the depths of\r\nthe sea?\r\n\r\nEther 3\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\nEther 3:1\r\n 1 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared, (now the number\r\nof the vessels which had been prepared was eight) went forth unto\r\nthe mount, which they called the mount Shelem, because of its\r\nexceeding height, and did molten out of a rock sixteen small\r\nstones; and they were white and clear, even as transparent glass;\r\nand he did carry them in his hands upon the top of the mount, and\r\ncried again unto the Lord, saying:\r\n\r\nEther 3:2\r\n 2 O Lord, thou hast said that we must be encompassed about by\r\nthe floods. Now behold, O Lord, and do not be angry with thy\r\nservant because of his weakness before thee; for we know that\r\nthou art holy and dwellest in the heavens, and that we are\r\nunworthy before thee; because of the fall our natures have become\r\nevil continually; nevertheless, O Lord, thou hast given us a\r\ncommandment that we must call upon thee, that from thee we may\r\nreceive according to our desires.\r\n\r\nEther 3:3\r\n 3 Behold, O Lord, thou hast smitten us because of our iniquity,\r\nand hast driven us forth, and for these many years we have been\r\nin the wilderness; nevertheless, thou hast been merciful unto us.\r\nO Lord, look upon me in pity, and turn away thine anger from this\r\nthy people, and suffer not that they shall go forth across this\r\nraging deep in darkness; but behold these things which I have\r\nmolten out of the rock.\r\n\r\nEther 3:4\r\n 4 And I know, O Lord, that thou hast all power, and can do\r\nwhatsoever thou wilt for the benefit of man; therefore touch\r\nthese stones, O Lord, with thy finger, and prepare them that they\r\nmay shine forth in darkness; and they shall shine forth unto us\r\nin the vessels which we have prepared, that we may have light\r\nwhile we shall cross the sea.\r\n\r\nEther 3:5\r\n 5 Behold, O Lord, thou canst do this. We know that thou art\r\nable to show forth great power, which looks small unto the\r\nunderstanding of men.\r\n\r\nEther 3:6\r\n 6 And it came to pass that when the brother of Jared had said\r\nthese words, behold, the Lord stretched forth his hand and\r\ntouched the stones one by one with his finger. And the veil was\r\ntaken from off the eyes of the brother of Jared, and he saw the\r\nfinger of the Lord; and it was as the finger of a man, like unto\r\nflesh and blood; and the brother of Jared fell down before the\r\nLord, for he was struck with fear.\r\n\r\nEther 3:7\r\n 7 And the Lord saw that the brother of Jared had fallen to the\r\nearth; and the Lord said unto him: Arise, why hast thou fallen?\r\n\r\nEther 3:8\r\n 8 And he saith unto the Lord: I saw the finger of the Lord, and\r\nI feared lest he should smite me; for I knew not that the Lord\r\nhad flesh and blood.\r\n\r\nEther 3:9\r\n 9 And the Lord said unto him: Because of thy faith thou hast\r\nseen that I shall take upon me flesh and blood; and never has man\r\ncome before me with such exceeding faith as thou hast; for were\r\nit not so ye could not have seen my finger. Sawest thou more\r\nthan this?\r\n\r\nEther 3:10\r\n 10 And he answered: Nay; Lord, show thyself unto me.\r\n\r\nEther 3:11\r\n 11 And the Lord said unto him: Believest thou the words which I\r\nshall speak?\r\n\r\nEther 3:12\r\n 12 And he answered: Yea, Lord, I know that thou speakest the\r\ntruth, for thou art a God of truth, and canst not lie.\r\n\r\nEther 3:13\r\n 13 And when he had said these words, behold, the Lord showed\r\nhimself unto him, and said: Because thou knowest these things ye\r\nare redeemed from the fall; therefore ye are brought back into my\r\npresence; therefore I show myself unto you.\r\n\r\nEther 3:14\r\n 14 Behold, I am he who was prepared from the foundation of the\r\nworld to redeem my people. Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the\r\nFather and the Son. In me shall all mankind have life, and that\r\neternally, even they who shall believe on my name; and they shall\r\nbecome my sons and my daughters.\r\n\r\nEther 3:15\r\n 15 And never have I showed myself unto man whom I have created,\r\nfor never has man believed in me as thou hast. Seest thou that\r\nye are created after mine own image? Yea, even all men were\r\ncreated in the beginning after mine own image.\r\n\r\nEther 3:16\r\n 16 Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my\r\nspirit; and man have I created after the body of my spirit; and\r\neven as I appear unto thee to be in the spirit will I appear unto\r\nmy people in the flesh.\r\n\r\nEther 3:17\r\n 17 And now, as I, Moroni, said I could not make a full account\r\nof these things which are written therefore it sufficeth me to\r\nsay that Jesus showed himself unto this man in the spirit, even\r\nafter the manner and in the likeness of the same body even as he\r\nshowed himself unto the Nephites.\r\n\r\nEther 3:18\r\n 18 And he ministered unto him even as he ministered unto the\r\nNephites; and all this, that this man might know that he was God,\r\nbecause of the many great works which the Lord had showed unto\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nEther 3:19\r\n 19 And because of the knowledge of this man he could not be kept\r\nfrom beholding within the veil; and he saw the finger of Jesus,\r\nwhich, when he saw, he fell with fear; for he knew that it was\r\nthe finger of the Lord; and he had faith no longer, for he knew,\r\nnothing doubting.\r\n\r\nEther 3:20\r\n 20 Wherefore, having this perfect knowledge of God, he could not\r\nbe kept from within the veil; therefore he saw Jesus; and he did\r\nminister unto him.\r\n\r\nEther 3:21\r\n 21 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto the brother of\r\nJared: Behold, thou shalt not suffer these things which ye have\r\nseen and heard to go forth unto the world, until the time cometh\r\nthat I shall glorify my name in the flesh; wherefore, ye shall\r\ntreasure up the things which ye have seen and heard, and show it\r\nto no man.\r\n\r\nEther 3:22\r\n 22 And behold, when ye shall come unto me, ye shall write them\r\nand shall seal them up, that no one can interpret them; for ye\r\nshall write them in a language that they cannot be read.\r\n\r\nEther 3:23\r\n 23 And behold, these two stones will I give unto thee, and ye\r\nshall seal them up also with the things which ye shall write.\r\n\r\nEther 3:24\r\n 24 For behold, the language which ye shall write I have\r\nconfounded; wherefore I will cause in my own due time that these\r\nstones shall magnify to the eyes of men these things which ye\r\nshall write.\r\n\r\nEther 3:25\r\n 25 And when the Lord had said these words, he showed unto the\r\nbrother of Jared all the inhabitants of the earth which had been,\r\nand also all that would be; and he withheld them not from his\r\nsight, even unto the ends of the earth.\r\n\r\nEther 3:26\r\n 26 For he had said unto him in times before, that if he would\r\nbelieve in him that he could show unto him all things--it should\r\nbe shown unto him; therefore the Lord could not withhold anything\r\nfrom him, for he knew that the Lord could show him all things.\r\n\r\nEther 3:27\r\n 27 And the Lord said unto him: Write these things and seal them\r\nup; and I will show them in mine own due time unto the children\r\nof men.\r\n\r\nEther 3:28\r\n 28 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded him that he\r\nshould seal up the two stones which he had received, and show\r\nthem not, until the Lord should show them unto the children of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nEther 4\r\nChapter 4\r\n\r\nEther 4:1\r\n 1 And the Lord commanded the brother of Jared to go down out of\r\nthe mount from the presence of the Lord, and write the things\r\nwhich he had seen; and they were forbidden to come unto the\r\nchildren of men until after that he should be lifted up upon the\r\ncross; and for this cause did king Mosiah keep them, that they\r\nshould not come unto the world until after Christ should show\r\nhimself unto his people.\r\n\r\nEther 4:2\r\n 2 And after Christ truly had showed himself unto his people he\r\ncommanded that they should be made manifest.\r\n\r\nEther 4:3\r\n 3 And now, after that, they have all dwindled in unbelief; and\r\nthere is none save it be the Lamanites, and they have rejected\r\nthe gospel of Christ; therefore I am commanded that I should hide\r\nthem up again in the earth.\r\n\r\nEther 4:4\r\n 4 Behold, I have written upon these plates the very things which\r\nthe brother of Jared saw; and there never were greater things\r\nmade manifest than those which were made manifest unto the\r\nbrother of Jared.\r\n\r\nEther 4:5\r\n 5 Wherefore the Lord hath commanded me to write them; and I have\r\nwritten them. And he commanded me that I should seal them up;\r\nand he also hath commanded that I should seal up the\r\ninterpretation thereof; wherefore I have sealed up the\r\ninterpreters, according to the commandment of the Lord.\r\n\r\nEther 4:6\r\n 6 For the Lord said unto me: They shall not go forth unto the\r\nGentiles until the day that they shall repent of their iniquity,\r\nand become clean before the Lord.\r\n\r\nEther 4:7\r\n 7 And in that day that they shall exercise faith in me, saith\r\nthe Lord, even as the brother of Jared did, that they may become\r\nsanctified in me, then will I manifest unto them the things which\r\nthe brother of Jared saw, even to the unfolding unto them all my\r\nrevelations, saith Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of\r\nthe heavens and of the earth, and all things that in them are.\r\n\r\nEther 4:8\r\n 8 And he that will contend against the word of the Lord, let him\r\nbe accursed; and he that shall deny these things, let him be\r\naccursed; for unto them will I show no greater things, saith\r\nJesus Christ; for I am he who speaketh.\r\n\r\nEther 4:9\r\n 9 And at my command the heavens are opened and are shut; and at\r\nmy word the earth shall shake; and at my command the inhabitants\r\nthereof shall pass away, even so as by fire.\r\n\r\nEther 4:10\r\n 10 And he that believeth not my words believeth not my\r\ndisciples; and if it so be that I do not speak, judge ye; for ye\r\nshall know that it is I that speaketh, at the last day.\r\n\r\nEther 4:11\r\n 11 But he that believeth these things which I have spoken, him\r\nwill I visit with the manifestations of my Spirit, and he shall\r\nknow and bear record. For because of my Spirit he shall know\r\nthat these things are true; for it persuadeth men to do good.\r\n\r\nEther 4:12\r\n 12 And whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do good is of me; for\r\ngood cometh of none save it be of me. I am the same that leadeth\r\nmen to all good; he that will not believe my words will not\r\nbelieve me--that I am; and he that will not believe me will not\r\nbelieve the Father who sent me. For behold, I am the Father, I\r\nam the light, and the life, and the truth of the world.\r\n\r\nEther 4:13\r\n 13 Come unto me, O ye Gentiles, and I will show unto you the\r\ngreater things, the knowledge which is hid up because of\r\nunbelief.\r\n\r\nEther 4:14\r\n 14 Come unto me, O ye house of Israel, and it shall be made\r\nmanifest unto you how great things the Father hath laid up for\r\nyou, from the foundation of the world; and it hath not come unto\r\nyou, because of unbelief.\r\n\r\nEther 4:15\r\n 15 Behold, when ye shall rend that veil of unbelief which doth\r\ncause you to remain in your awful state of wickedness, and\r\nhardness of heart, and blindness of mind, then shall the great\r\nand marvelous things which have been hid up from the foundation\r\nof the world from you--yea, when ye shall call upon the Father in\r\nmy name, with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, then shall ye\r\nknow that the Father hath remembered the covenant which he made\r\nunto your fathers, O house of Israel.\r\n\r\nEther 4:16\r\n 16 And then shall my revelations which I have caused to be\r\nwritten by my servant John be unfolded in the eyes of all the\r\npeople. Remember, when ye see these things, ye shall know that\r\nthe time is at hand that they shall be made manifest in very\r\ndeed.\r\n\r\nEther 4:17\r\n 17 Therefore, when ye shall receive this record ye may know that\r\nthe work of the Father has commenced upon all the face of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nEther 4:18\r\n 18 Therefore, repent all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me,\r\nand believe in my gospel, and be baptized in my name; for he that\r\nbelieveth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth\r\nnot shall be damned; and signs shall follow them that believe in\r\nmy name.\r\n\r\nEther 4:19\r\n 19 And blessed is he that is found faithful unto my name at the\r\nlast day, for he shall be lifted up to dwell in the kingdom\r\nprepared for him from the foundation of the world. And behold it\r\nis I that hath spoken it. Amen.\r\n\r\nEther 5\r\nChapter 5\r\n\r\nEther 5:1\r\n 1 And now I, Moroni, have written the words which were commanded\r\nme, according to my memory; and I have told you the things which\r\nI have sealed up; therefore touch them not in order that ye may\r\ntranslate; for that thing is forbidden you, except by and by it\r\nshall be wisdom in God.\r\n\r\nEther 5:2\r\n 2 And behold, ye may be privileged that ye may show the plates\r\nunto those who shall assist to bring forth this work;\r\n\r\nEther 5:3\r\n 3 And unto three shall they be shown by the power of God;\r\nwherefore they shall know of a surety that these things are true.\r\n\r\nEther 5:4\r\n 4 And in the mouth of three witnesses shall these things be\r\nestablished; and the testimony of three, and this work, in the\r\nwhich shall be shown forth the power of God and also his word, of\r\nwhich the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost bear\r\nrecord--and all this shall stand as a testimony against the world\r\nat the last day.\r\n\r\nEther 5:5\r\n 5 And if it so be that they repent and come unto the Father in\r\nthe name of Jesus, they shall be received into the kingdom of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nEther 5:6\r\n 6 And now, if I have no authority for these things, judge ye;\r\nfor ye shall know that I have authority when ye shall see me, and\r\nwe shall stand before God at the last day. Amen.\r\n\r\nEther 6\r\nChapter 6\r\n\r\nEther 6:1\r\n 1 And now I, Moroni, proceed to give the record of Jared and his\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nEther 6:2\r\n 2 For it came to pass after the Lord had prepared the stones\r\nwhich the brother of Jared had carried up into the mount, the\r\nbrother of Jared came down out of the mount, and he did put forth\r\nthe stones into the vessels which were prepared, one in each end\r\nthereof; and behold, they did give light unto the vessels.\r\n\r\nEther 6:3\r\n 3 And thus the Lord caused stones to shine in darkness, to give\r\nlight unto men, women, and children, that they might not cross\r\nthe great waters in darkness.\r\n\r\nEther 6:4\r\n 4 And it came to pass that when they had prepared all manner of\r\nfood, that thereby they might subsist upon the water, and also\r\nfood for their flocks and herds, and whatsoever beast or animal\r\nor fowl that they should carry with them--and it came to pass\r\nthat when they had done all these things they got aboard of their\r\nvessels or barges, and set forth into the sea, commending\r\nthemselves unto the Lord their God.\r\n\r\nEther 6:5\r\n 5 And it came to pass that the Lord God caused that there should\r\nbe a furious wind blow upon the face of the waters, towards the\r\npromised land; and thus they were tossed upon the waves of the\r\nsea before the wind.\r\n\r\nEther 6:6\r\n 6 And it came to pass that they were many times buried in the\r\ndepths of the sea, because of the mountain waves which broke upon\r\nthem, and also the great and terrible tempests which were caused\r\nby the fierceness of the wind.\r\n\r\nEther 6:7\r\n 7 And it came to pass that when they were buried in the deep\r\nthere was no water that could hurt them, their vessels being\r\ntight like unto a dish, and also they were tight like unto the\r\nark of Noah; therefore when they were encompassed about by many\r\nwaters they did cry unto the Lord, and he did bring them forth\r\nagain upon the top of the waters.\r\n\r\nEther 6:8\r\n 8 And it came to pass that the wind did never cease to blow\r\ntowards the promised land while they were upon the waters; and\r\nthus they were driven forth before the wind.\r\n\r\nEther 6:9\r\n 9 And they did sing praises unto the Lord; yea, the brother of\r\nJared did sing praises unto the Lord, and he did thank and praise\r\nthe Lord all the day long; and when the night came, they did not\r\ncease to praise the Lord.\r\n\r\nEther 6:10\r\n 10 And thus they were driven forth; and no monster of the sea\r\ncould break them, neither whale that could mar them; and they did\r\nhave light continually, whether it was above the water or under\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nEther 6:11\r\n 11 And thus they were driven forth, three hundred and forty and\r\nfour days upon the water.\r\n\r\nEther 6:12\r\n 12 And they did land upon the shore of the promised land. And\r\nwhen they had set their feet upon the shores of the promised land\r\nthey bowed themselves down upon the face of the land, and did\r\nhumble themselves before the Lord, and did shed tears of joy\r\nbefore the Lord, because of the multitude of his tender mercies\r\nover them.\r\n\r\nEther 6:13\r\n 13 And it came to pass that they went forth upon the face of the\r\nland, and began to till the earth.\r\n\r\nEther 6:14\r\n 14 And Jared had four sons; and they were called Jacom, and\r\nGilgah, and Mahah, and Orihah.\r\n\r\nEther 6:15\r\n 15 And the brother of Jared also begat sons and daughters.\r\n\r\nEther 6:16\r\n 16 And the friends of Jared and his brother were in number about\r\ntwenty and two souls; and they also begat sons and daughters\r\nbefore they came to the promised land; and therefore they began\r\nto be many.\r\n\r\nEther 6:17\r\n 17 And they were taught to walk humbly before the Lord; and they\r\nwere also taught from on high.\r\n\r\nEther 6:18\r\n 18 And it came to pass that they began to spread upon the face\r\nof the land, and to multiply and to till the earth; and they did\r\nwax strong in the land.\r\n\r\nEther 6:19\r\n 19 And the brother of Jared began to be old, and saw that he\r\nmust soon go down to the grave; wherefore he said unto Jared: Let\r\nus gather together our people that we may number them, that we\r\nmay know of them what they will desire of us before we go down to\r\nour graves.\r\n\r\nEther 6:20\r\n 20 And accordingly the people were gathered together. Now the\r\nnumber of the sons and the daughters of the brother of Jared were\r\ntwenty and two souls; and the number of sons and daughters of\r\nJared were twelve, he having four sons.\r\n\r\nEther 6:21\r\n 21 And it came to pass that they did number their people; and\r\nafter that they had numbered them, they did desire of them the\r\nthings which they would that they should do before they went down\r\nto their graves.\r\n\r\nEther 6:22\r\n 22 And it came to pass that the people desired of them that they\r\nshould anoint one of their sons to be a king over them.\r\n\r\nEther 6:23\r\n 23 And now behold, this was grievous unto them. And the brother\r\nof Jared said unto them: Surely this thing leadeth into\r\ncaptivity.\r\n\r\nEther 6:24\r\n 24 But Jared said unto his brother: Suffer them that they may\r\nhave a king. And therefore he said unto them: Choose ye out from\r\namong our sons a king, even whom ye will.\r\n\r\nEther 6:25\r\n 25 And it came to pass that they chose even the firstborn of the\r\nbrother of Jared; and his name was Pagag. And it came to pass\r\nthat he refused and would not be their king. And the people\r\nwould that his father should constrain him, but his father would\r\nnot; and he commanded them that they should constrain no man to\r\nbe their king.\r\n\r\nEther 6:26\r\n 26 And it came to pass that they chose all the brothers of\r\nPagag, and they would not.\r\n\r\nEther 6:27\r\n 27 And it came to pass that neither would the sons of Jared,\r\neven all save it were one; and Orihah was anointed to be king\r\nover the people.\r\n\r\nEther 6:28\r\n 28 And he began to reign, and the people began to prosper; and\r\nthey became exceedingly rich.\r\n\r\nEther 6:29\r\n 29 And it came to pass that Jared died, and his brother also.\r\n\r\nEther 6:30\r\n 30 And it came to pass that Orihah did walk humbly before the\r\nLord, and did remember how great things the Lord had done for his\r\nfather, and also taught his people how great things the Lord had\r\ndone for their fathers.\r\n\r\nEther 7\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\nEther 7:1\r\n 1 And it came to pass that Orihah did execute judgment upon the\r\nland in righteousness all his days, whose days were exceedingly\r\nmany.\r\n\r\nEther 7:2\r\n 2 And he begat sons and daughters; yea, he begat thirty and one,\r\namong whom were twenty and three sons.\r\n\r\nEther 7:3\r\n 3 And it came to pass that he also begat Kib in his old age.\r\nAnd it came to pass that Kib reigned in his stead; and Kib begat\r\nCorihor.\r\n\r\nEther 7:4\r\n 4 And when Corihor was thirty and two years old he rebelled\r\nagainst his father, and went over and dwelt in the land of Nehor;\r\nand he begat sons and daughters, and they became exceedingly\r\nfair; wherefore Corihor drew away many people after him.\r\n\r\nEther 7:5\r\n 5 And when he had gathered together an army he came up unto the\r\nland of Moron where the king dwelt, and took him captive, which\r\nbrought to pass the saying of the brother of Jared that they\r\nwould be brought into captivity.\r\n\r\nEther 7:6\r\n 6 Now the land of Moron, where the king dwelt, was near the land\r\nwhich is called Desolation by the Nephites.\r\n\r\nEther 7:7\r\n 7 And it came to pass that Kib dwelt in captivity, and his\r\npeople under Corihor his son, until he became exceedingly old;\r\nnevertheless Kib begat Shule in his old age, while he was yet in\r\ncaptivity.\r\n\r\nEther 7:8\r\n 8 And it came to pass that Shule was angry with his brother; and\r\nShule waxed strong, and became mighty as to the strength of a\r\nman; and he was also mighty in judgment.\r\n\r\nEther 7:9\r\n 9 Wherefore, he came to the hill Ephraim, and he did molten out\r\nof the hill, and made swords out of steel for those whom he had\r\ndrawn away with him; and after he had armed them with swords he\r\nreturned to the city Nehor and gave battle unto his brother\r\nCorihor, by which means he obtained the kingdom and restored it\r\nunto his father Kib.\r\n\r\nEther 7:10\r\n 10 And now because of the thing which Shule had done, his father\r\nbestowed upon him the kingdom; therefore he began to reign in the\r\nstead of his father.\r\n\r\nEther 7:11\r\n 11 And it came to pass that he did execute judgment in\r\nrighteousness; and he did spread his kingdom upon all the face of\r\nthe land, for the people had become exceedingly numerous.\r\n\r\nEther 7:12\r\n 12 And it came to pass that Shule also begat many sons and\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\nEther 7:13\r\n 13 And Corihor repented of the many evils which he had done;\r\nwherefore Shule gave him power in his kingdom.\r\n\r\nEther 7:14\r\n 14 And it came to pass that Corihor had many sons and daughters.\r\n\r\nAnd among the sons of Corihor there was one whose name was Noah.\r\n\r\nEther 7:15\r\n 15 And it came to pass that Noah rebelled against Shule, the\r\nking, and also his father Corihor, and drew away Cohor his\r\nbrother, and also all his brethren and many of the people.\r\n\r\nEther 7:16\r\n 16 And he gave battle unto Shule the king, in which he did\r\nobtain the land of their first inheritance; and he became a king\r\nover that part of the land.\r\n\r\nEther 7:17\r\n 17 And it came to pass that he gave battle again unto Shule, the\r\nking; and he took Shule, the king, and carried him away captive\r\ninto Moron.\r\n\r\nEther 7:18\r\n 18 And it came to pass as he was about to put him to death, the\r\nsons of Shule crept into the house of Noah by night and slew him,\r\nand broke down the door of the prison and brought out their\r\nfather, and placed him upon his throne in his own kingdom.\r\n\r\nEther 7:19\r\n 19 Wherefore, the son of Noah did build up his kingdom in his\r\nstead; nevertheless they did not gain power any more over Shule\r\nthe king, and the people who were under the reign of Shule the\r\nking did prosper exceedingly and wax great.\r\n\r\nEther 7:20\r\n 20 And the country was divided; and there were two kingdoms, the\r\nkingdom of Shule, and the kingdom of Cohor, the son of Noah.\r\n\r\nEther 7:21\r\n 21 And Cohor, the son of Noah, caused that his people should\r\ngive battle unto Shule, in which Shule did beat them and did slay\r\nCohor.\r\n\r\nEther 7:22\r\n 22 And now Cohor had a son who was called Nimrod; and Nimrod\r\ngave up the kingdom of Cohor unto Shule, and he did gain favor in\r\nthe eyes of Shule; wherefore Shule did bestow great favors upon\r\nhim, and he did do in the kingdom of Shule according to his\r\ndesires.\r\n\r\nEther 7:23\r\n 23 And also in the reign of Shule there came prophets among the\r\npeople, who were sent from the Lord, prophesying that the\r\nwickedness and idolatry of the people was bringing a curse upon\r\nthe land, and they should be destroyed if they did not repent.\r\n\r\nEther 7:24\r\n 24 And it came to pass that the people did revile against the\r\nprophets, and did mock them. And it came to pass that king Shule\r\ndid execute judgment against all those who did revile against the\r\nprophets.\r\n\r\nEther 7:25\r\n 25 And he did execute a law throughout all the land, which gave\r\npower unto the prophets that they should go whithersoever they\r\nwould; and by this cause the people were brought unto repentance.\r\n\r\nEther 7:26\r\n 26 And because the people did repent of their iniquities and\r\nidolatries the Lord did spare them, and they began to prosper\r\nagain in the land. And it came to pass that Shule begat sons and\r\ndaughters in his old age.\r\n\r\nEther 7:27\r\n 27 And there were no more wars in the days of Shule; and he\r\nremembered the great things that the Lord had done for his\r\nfathers in bringing them across the great deep into the promised\r\nland; wherefore he did execute judgment in righteousness all his\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nEther 8\r\nChapter 8\r\n\r\nEther 8:1\r\n 1 And it came to pass that he begat Omer, and Omer reigned in\r\nhis stead. And Omer begat Jared; and Jared begat sons and\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\nEther 8:2\r\n 2 And Jared rebelled against his father, and came and dwelt in\r\nthe land of Heth. And it came to pass that he did flatter many\r\npeople, because of his cunning words, until he had gained the\r\nhalf of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nEther 8:3\r\n 3 And when he had gained the half of the kingdom he gave battle\r\nunto his father, and he did carry away his father into captivity,\r\nand did make him serve in captivity;\r\n\r\nEther 8:4\r\n 4 And now, in the days of the reigns of Omer he was in captivity\r\nthe half of his days. And it came to pass that he begat sons and\r\ndaughters among whom were Esrom and Coriantumr;\r\n\r\nEther 8:5\r\n 5 And they were exceedingly angry because of the doings of Jared\r\ntheir brother, insomuch that they did raise an army and gave\r\nbattle unto Jared. And it came to pass that they did give battle\r\nunto him by night.\r\n\r\nEther 8:6\r\n 6 And it came to pass that when they had slain the army of Jared\r\nthey were about to slay him also; and he plead with them that\r\nthey would not slay him, and he would give up the kingdom unto\r\nhis father. And it came to pass that they did grant unto him his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nEther 8:7\r\n 7 And now Jared became exceedingly sorrowful because of the loss\r\nof the kingdom, for he had set his heart upon the kingdom and\r\nupon the glory of the world.\r\n\r\nEther 8:8\r\n 8 Now the daughter of Jared being exceedingly expert, and seeing\r\nthe sorrows of her father, thought to devise a plan whereby she\r\ncould redeem the kingdom unto her father.\r\n\r\nEther 8:9\r\n 9 Now the daughter of Jared was exceedingly fair. And it came\r\nto pass that she did talk with her father, and said unto him:\r\nWhereby hath my father so much sorrow? Hath he not read the\r\nrecord which our fathers brought across the great deep? Behold,\r\nis there not an account concerning them of old, that they by\r\ntheir secret plans did obtain kingdoms and great glory?\r\n\r\nEther 8:10\r\n 10 And now, therefore, let my father send for Akish, the son of\r\nKimnor; and behold, I am fair, and I will dance before him, and I\r\nwill please him, that he will desire me to wife; wherefore if he\r\nshall desire of thee that ye shall give unto him me to wife, then\r\nshall ye say: I will give her if ye will bring unto me the head\r\nof my father, the king.\r\n\r\nEther 8:11\r\n 11 And now Omer was a friend to Akish; wherefore, when Jared had\r\nsent for Akish, the daughter of Jared danced before him that she\r\npleased him, insomuch that he desired her to wife. And it came\r\nto pass that he said unto Jared: Give her unto me to wife.\r\n\r\nEther 8:12\r\n 12 And Jared said unto him: I will give her unto you, if ye will\r\nbring unto me the head of my father, the king.\r\n\r\nEther 8:13\r\n 13 And it came to pass that Akish gathered in unto the house of\r\nJared all his kinsfolk, and said unto them: Will ye swear unto me\r\nthat ye will be faithful unto me in the thing which I shall\r\ndesire of you?\r\n\r\nEther 8:14\r\n 14 And it came to pass that they all sware unto him, by the God\r\nof heaven, and also by the heavens, and also by the earth, and by\r\ntheir heads, that whoso should vary from the assistance which\r\nAkish desired should lose his head; and whoso should divulge\r\nwhatsoever thing Akish made known unto them, the same should lose\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nEther 8:15\r\n 15 And it came to pass that thus they did agree with Akish. And\r\nAkish did administer unto them the oaths which were given by them\r\nof old who also sought power, which had been handed down even\r\nfrom Cain, who was a murderer from the beginning.\r\n\r\nEther 8:16\r\n 16 And they were kept up by the power of the devil to administer\r\nthese oaths unto the people, to keep them in darkness, to help\r\nsuch as sought power to gain power, and to murder, and to\r\nplunder, and to lie, and to commit all manner of wickedness and\r\nwhoredoms.\r\n\r\nEther 8:17\r\n 17 And it was the daughter of Jared who put it into his heart to\r\nsearch up these things of old; and Jared put it into the heart of\r\nAkish; wherefore, Akish administered it unto his kindred and\r\nfriends, leading them away by fair promises to do whatsoever\r\nthing he desired.\r\n\r\nEther 8:18\r\n 18 And it came to pass that they formed a secret combination,\r\neven as they of old; which combination is most abominable and\r\nwicked above all, in the sight of God;\r\n\r\nEther 8:19\r\n 19 For the Lord worketh not in secret combinations, neither doth\r\nhe will that man should shed blood, but in all things hath\r\nforbidden it, from the beginning of man.\r\n\r\nEther 8:20\r\n 20 And now I, Moroni, do not write the manner of their oaths and\r\ncombinations, for it hath been made known unto me that they are\r\nhad among all people, and they are had among the Lamanites.\r\n\r\nEther 8:21\r\n 21 And they have caused the destruction of this people of whom I\r\nam now speaking, and also the destruction of the people of Nephi.\r\n\r\nEther 8:22\r\n 22 And whatsoever nation shall uphold such secret combinations,\r\nto get power and gain, until they shall spread over the nation,\r\nbehold, they shall be destroyed; for the Lord will not suffer\r\nthat the blood of his saints, which shall be shed by them, shall\r\nalways cry unto him from the ground for vengeance upon them and\r\nyet he avenge them not.\r\n\r\nEther 8:23\r\n 23 Wherefore, O ye Gentiles, it is wisdom in God that these\r\nthings should be shown unto you, that thereby ye may repent of\r\nyour sins, and suffer not that these murderous combinations shall\r\nget above you, which are built up to get power and gain--and the\r\nwork, yea, even the work of destruction come upon you, yea, even\r\nthe sword of the justice of the Eternal God shall fall upon you,\r\nto your overthrow and destruction if ye shall suffer these things\r\nto be.\r\n\r\nEther 8:24\r\n 24 Wherefore, the Lord commandeth you, when ye shall see these\r\nthings come among you that ye shall awake to a sense of your\r\nawful situation, because of this secret combination which shall\r\nbe among you; or wo be unto it, because of the blood of them who\r\nhave been slain; for they cry from the dust for vengeance upon\r\nit, and also upon those who built it up.\r\n\r\nEther 8:25\r\n 25 For it cometh to pass that whoso buildeth it up seeketh to\r\noverthrow the freedom of all lands, nations, and countries; and\r\nit bringeth to pass the destruction of all people, for it is\r\nbuilt up by the devil, who is the father of all lies; even that\r\nsame liar who beguiled our first parents, yea, even that same\r\nliar who hath caused man to commit murder from the beginning; who\r\nhath hardened the hearts of men that they have murdered the\r\nprophets, and stoned them, and cast them out from the beginning.\r\n\r\nEther 8:26\r\n 26 Wherefore, I, Moroni, am commanded to write these things that\r\nevil may be done away, and that the time may come that Satan may\r\nhave no power upon the hearts of the children of men, but that\r\nthey may be persuaded to do good continually, that they may come\r\nunto the fountain of all righteousness and be saved.\r\n\r\nEther 9\r\nChapter 9\r\n\r\nEther 9:1\r\n 1 And now I, Moroni, proceed with my record. Therefore, behold,\r\nit came to pass that because of the secret combinations of Akish\r\nand his friends, behold, they did overthrow the kingdom of Omer.\r\n\r\nEther 9:2\r\n 2 Nevertheless, the Lord was merciful unto Omer, and also to his\r\nsons and to his daughters who did not seek his destruction.\r\n\r\nEther 9:3\r\n 3 And the Lord warned Omer in a dream that he should depart out\r\nof the land; wherefore Omer departed out of the land with his\r\nfamily, and traveled many days, and came over and passed by the\r\nhill of Shim, and came over by the place where the Nephites were\r\ndestroyed, and from thence eastward, and came to a place which\r\nwas called Ablom, by the seashore, and there he pitched his tent,\r\nand also his sons and his daughters, and all his household, save\r\nit were Jared and his family.\r\n\r\nEther 9:4\r\n 4 And it came to pass that Jared was anointed king over the\r\npeople, by the hand of wickedness; and he gave unto Akish his\r\ndaughter to wife.\r\n\r\nEther 9:5\r\n 5 And it came to pass that Akish sought the life of his\r\nfather-in-law; and he applied unto those whom he had sworn by the\r\noath of the ancients, and they obtained the head of his\r\nfather-in-law, as he sat upon his throne, giving audience to his\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nEther 9:6\r\n 6 For so great had been the spreading of this wicked and secret\r\nsociety that it had corrupted the hearts of all the people;\r\ntherefore Jared was murdered upon his throne, and Akish reigned\r\nin his stead.\r\n\r\nEther 9:7\r\n 7 And it came to pass that Akish began to be jealous of his son,\r\ntherefore he shut him up in prison, and kept him upon little or\r\nno food until he had suffered death.\r\n\r\nEther 9:8\r\n 8 And now the brother of him that suffered death, (and his name\r\nwas Nimrah) was angry with his father because of that which his\r\nfather had done unto his brother.\r\n\r\nEther 9:9\r\n 9 And it came to pass that Nimrah gathered together a small\r\nnumber of men, and fled out of the land, and came over and dwelt\r\nwith Omer.\r\n\r\nEther 9:10\r\n 10 And it came to pass that Akish begat other sons, and they won\r\nthe hearts of the people, notwithstanding they had sworn unto him\r\nto do all manner of iniquity according to that which he desired.\r\n\r\nEther 9:11\r\n 11 Now the people of Akish were desirous for gain, even as Akish\r\nwas desirous for power; wherefore, the sons of Akish did offer\r\nthem money, by which means they drew away the more part of the\r\npeople after them.\r\n\r\nEther 9:12\r\n 12 And there began to be a war between the sons of Akish and\r\nAkish, which lasted for the space of many years, yea, unto the\r\ndestruction of nearly all the people of the kingdom, yea, even\r\nall, save it were thirty souls, and they who fled with the house\r\nof Omer.\r\n\r\nEther 9:13\r\n 13 Wherefore, Omer was restored again to the land of his\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\nEther 9:14\r\n 14 And it came to pass that Omer began to be old; nevertheless,\r\nin his old age he begat Emer; and he anointed Emer to be king to\r\nreign in his stead.\r\n\r\nEther 9:15\r\n 15 And after that he had anointed Emer to be king he saw peace\r\nin the land for the space of two years, and he died, having seen\r\nexceedingly many days, which were full of sorrow. And it came to\r\npass that Emer did reign in his stead, and did fill the steps of\r\nhis father.\r\n\r\nEther 9:16\r\n 16 And the Lord began again to take the curse from off the land,\r\nand the house of Emer did prosper exceedingly under the reign of\r\nEmer; and in the space of sixty and two years they had become\r\nexceedingly strong, insomuch that they became exceedingly rich--\r\n\r\nEther 9:17\r\n 17 Having all manner of fruit, and of grain, and of silks, and\r\nof fine linen, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious\r\nthings;\r\n\r\nEther 9:18\r\n 18 And also all manner of cattle, of oxen, and cows, and of\r\nsheep, and of swine, and of goats, and also many other kinds of\r\nanimals which were useful for the food of man.\r\n\r\nEther 9:19\r\n 19 And they also had horses, and asses, and there were elephants\r\nand cureloms and cumoms; all of which were useful unto man, and\r\nmore especially the elephants and cureloms and cumoms.\r\n\r\nEther 9:20\r\n 20 And thus the Lord did pour out his blessings upon this land,\r\nwhich was choice above all other lands; and he commanded that\r\nwhoso should possess the land should possess it unto the Lord, or\r\nthey should be destroyed when they were ripened in iniquity; for\r\nupon such, saith the Lord: I will pour out the fulness of my\r\nwrath.\r\n\r\nEther 9:21\r\n 21 And Emer did execute judgment in righteousness all his days,\r\nand he begat many sons and daughters; and he begat Coriantum, and\r\nhe anointed Coriantum to reign in his stead.\r\n\r\nEther 9:22\r\n 22 And after he had anointed Coriantum to reign in his stead he\r\nlived four years, and he saw peace in the land; yea, and he even\r\nsaw the Son of Righteousness, and did rejoice and glory in his\r\nday; and he died in peace.\r\n\r\nEther 9:23\r\n 23 And it came to pass that Coriantum did walk in the steps of\r\nhis father, and did build many mighty cities, and did administer\r\nthat which was good unto his people in all his days. And it came\r\nto pass that he had no children even until he was exceedingly\r\nold.\r\n\r\nEther 9:24\r\n 24 And it came to pass that his wife died, being an hundred and\r\ntwo years old. And it came to pass that Coriantum took to wife,\r\nin his old age, a young maid, and begat sons and daughters;\r\nwherefore he lived until he was an hundred and forty and two\r\nyears old.\r\n\r\nEther 9:25\r\n 25 And it came to pass that he begat Com, and Com reigned in his\r\nstead; and he reigned forty and nine years, and he begat Heth;\r\nand he also begat other sons and daughters.\r\n\r\nEther 9:26\r\n 26 And the people had spread again over all the face of the\r\nland, and there began again to be an exceedingly great wickedness\r\nupon the face of the land, and Heth began to embrace the secret\r\nplans again of old, to destroy his father.\r\n\r\nEther 9:27\r\n 27 And it came to pass that he did dethrone his father, for he\r\nslew him with his own sword; and he did reign in his stead.\r\n\r\nEther 9:28\r\n 28 And there came prophets in the land again, crying repentance\r\nunto them--that they must prepare the way of the Lord or there\r\nshould come a curse upon the face of the land; yea, even there\r\nshould be a great famine, in which they should be destroyed if\r\nthey did not repent.\r\n\r\nEther 9:29\r\n 29 But the people believed not the words of the prophets, but\r\nthey cast them out; and some of them they cast into pits and left\r\nthem to perish. And it came to pass that they did all these\r\nthings according to the commandment of the king, Heth.\r\n\r\nEther 9:30\r\n 30 And it came to pass that there began to be a great dearth\r\nupon the land, and the inhabitants began to be destroyed\r\nexceedingly fast because of the dearth, for there was no rain\r\nupon the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nEther 9:31\r\n 31 And there came forth poisonous serpents also upon the face of\r\nthe land, and did poison many people. And it came to pass that\r\ntheir flocks began to flee before the poisonous serpents, towards\r\nthe land southward, which was called by the Nephites Zarahemla.\r\n\r\nEther 9:32\r\n 32 And it came to pass that there were many of them which did\r\nperish by the way; nevertheless, there were some which fled into\r\nthe land southward.\r\n\r\nEther 9:33\r\n 33 And it came to pass that the Lord did cause the serpents that\r\nthey should pursue them no more, but that they should hedge up\r\nthe way that the people could not pass, that whoso should attempt\r\nto pass might fall by the poisonous serpents.\r\n\r\nEther 9:34\r\n 34 And it came to pass that the people did follow the course of\r\nthe beasts, and did devour the carcasses of them which fell by\r\nthe way, until they had devoured them all. Now when the people\r\nsaw that they must perish they began to repent of their\r\niniquities and cry unto the Lord.\r\n\r\nEther 9:35\r\n 35 And it came to pass that when they had humbled themselves\r\nsufficiently before the Lord he did send rain upon the face of\r\nthe earth; and the people began to revive again, and there began\r\nto be fruit in the north countries, and in all the countries\r\nround about. And the Lord did show forth his power unto them in\r\npreserving them from famine.\r\n\r\nEther 10\r\nChapter 10\r\n\r\nEther 10:1\r\n 1 And it came to pass that Shez, who was a descendant of\r\nHeth--for Heth had perished by the famine, and all his household\r\nsave it were Shez--wherefore, Shez began to build up again a\r\nbroken people.\r\n\r\nEther 10:2\r\n 2 And it came to pass that Shez did remember the destruction of\r\nhis fathers, and he did build up a righteous kingdom; for he\r\nremembered what the Lord had done in bringing Jared and his\r\nbrother across the deep; and he did walk in the ways of the Lord;\r\nand he begat sons and daughters.\r\n\r\nEther 10:3\r\n 3 And his eldest son, whose name was Shez, did rebel against\r\nhim; nevertheless, Shez was smitten by the hand of a robber,\r\nbecause of his exceeding riches, which brought peace again unto\r\nhis father.\r\n\r\nEther 10:4\r\n 4 And it came to pass that his father did build up many cities\r\nupon the face of the land, and the people began again to spread\r\nover all the face of the land. And Shez did live to an\r\nexceedingly old age; and he begat Riplakish. And he died, and\r\nRiplakish reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\nEther 10:5\r\n 5 And it came to pass that Riplakish did not do that which was\r\nright in the sight of the Lord, for he did have many wives and\r\nconcubines, and did lay that upon men's shoulders which was\r\ngrievous to be borne; yea, he did tax them with heavy taxes; and\r\nwith the taxes he did build many spacious buildings.\r\n\r\nEther 10:6\r\n 6 And he did erect him an exceedingly beautiful throne; and he\r\ndid build many prisons, and whoso would not be subject unto taxes\r\nhe did cast into prison; and whoso was not able to pay taxes he\r\ndid cast into prison; and he did cause that they should labor\r\ncontinually for their support; and whoso refused to labor he did\r\ncause to be put to death.\r\n\r\nEther 10:7\r\n 7 Wherefore he did obtain all his fine work, yea, even his fine\r\ngold he did cause to be refined in prison, and all manner of fine\r\nworkmanship he did cause to be wrought in prison. And it came to\r\npass that he did afflict the people with his whoredoms and\r\nabominations.\r\n\r\nEther 10:8\r\n 8 And when he had reigned for the space of forty and two years\r\nthe people did rise up in rebellion against him; and there began\r\nto be war again in the land, insomuch that Riplakish was killed,\r\nand his descendants were driven out of the land.\r\n\r\nEther 10:9\r\n 9 And it came to pass after the space of many years, Morianton,\r\n(he being a descendant of Riplakish) gathered together an army of\r\noutcasts, and went forth and gave battle unto the people; and he\r\ngained power over many cities; and the war became exceedingly\r\nsore, and did last for the space of many years; and he did gain\r\npower over all the land, and did establish himself king over all\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nEther 10:10\r\n 10 And after that he had established himself king he did ease\r\nthe burden of the people, by which he did gain favor in the eyes\r\nof the people, and they did anoint him to be their king.\r\n\r\nEther 10:11\r\n 11 And he did do justice unto the people, but not unto himself\r\nbecause of his many whoredoms; wherefore he was cut off from the\r\npresence of the Lord.\r\n\r\nEther 10:12\r\n 12 And it came to pass that Morianton built up many cities, and\r\nthe people became exceedingly rich under his reign, both in\r\nbuildings, and in gold and silver, and in raising grain, and in\r\nflocks, and herds, and such things which had been restored unto\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nEther 10:13\r\n 13 And Morianton did live to an exceedingly great age, and then\r\nhe begat Kim; and Kim did reign in the stead of his father; and\r\nhe did reign eight years, and his father died. And it came to\r\npass that Kim did not reign in righteousness, wherefore he was\r\nnot favored of the Lord.\r\n\r\nEther 10:14\r\n 14 And his brother did rise up in rebellion against him, by\r\nwhich he did bring him into captivity; and he did remain in\r\ncaptivity all his days; and he begat sons and daughters in\r\ncaptivity, and in his old age he begat Levi; and he died.\r\n\r\nEther 10:15\r\n 15 And it came to pass that Levi did serve in captivity after\r\nthe death of his father, for the space of forty and two years.\r\nAnd he did make war against the king of the land, by which he did\r\nobtain unto himself the kingdom.\r\n\r\nEther 10:16\r\n 16 And after he had obtained unto himself the kingdom he did\r\nthat which was right in the sight of the Lord; and the people did\r\nprosper in the land; and he did live to a good old age, and begat\r\nsons and daughters; and he also begat Corom, whom he anointed\r\nking in his stead.\r\n\r\nEther 10:17\r\n 17 And it came to pass that Corom did that which was good in the\r\nsight of the Lord all his days; and he begat many sons and\r\ndaughters; and after he had seen many days he did pass away, even\r\nlike unto the rest of the earth; and Kish reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\nEther 10:18\r\n 18 And it came to pass that Kish passed away also, and Lib\r\nreigned in his stead.\r\n\r\nEther 10:19\r\n 19 And it came to pass that Lib also did that which was good in\r\nthe sight of the Lord. And in the days of Lib the poisonous\r\nserpents were destroyed. Wherefore they did go into the land\r\nsouthward, to hunt food for the people of the land, for the land\r\nwas covered with animals of the forest. And Lib also himself\r\nbecame a great hunter.\r\n\r\nEther 10:20\r\n 20 And they built a great city by the narrow neck of land, by\r\nthe place where the sea divides the land.\r\n\r\nEther 10:21\r\n 21 And they did preserve the land southward for a wilderness, to\r\nget game. And the whole face of the land northward was covered\r\nwith inhabitants.\r\n\r\nEther 10:22\r\n 22 And they were exceedingly industrious, and they did buy and\r\nsell and traffic one with another, that they might get gain.\r\n\r\nEther 10:23\r\n 23 And they did work in all manner of ore, and they did make\r\ngold, and silver, and iron, and brass, and all manner of metals;\r\nand they did dig it out of the earth; wherefore they did cast up\r\nmighty heaps of earth to get ore, of gold, and of silver, and of\r\niron, and of copper. And they did work all manner of fine work.\r\n\r\nEther 10:24\r\n 24 And they did have silks, and fine-twined linen; and they did\r\nwork all manner of cloth, that they might clothe themselves from\r\ntheir nakedness.\r\n\r\nEther 10:25\r\n 25 And they did make all manner of tools to till the earth, both\r\nto plow and to sow, to reap and to hoe, and also to thrash.\r\n\r\nEther 10:26\r\n 26 And they did make all manner of tools with which they did\r\nwork their beasts.\r\n\r\nEther 10:27\r\n 27 And they did make all manner of weapons of war. And they did\r\nwork all manner of work of exceedingly curious workmanship.\r\n\r\nEther 10:28\r\n 28 And never could be a people more blessed than were they, and\r\nmore prospered by the hand of the Lord. And they were in a land\r\nthat was choice above all lands, for the Lord had spoken it.\r\n\r\nEther 10:29\r\n 29 And it came to pass that Lib did live many years, and begat\r\nsons and daughters; and he also begat Hearthom.\r\n\r\nEther 10:30\r\n 30 And it came to pass that Hearthom reigned in the stead of his\r\nfather. And when Hearthom had reigned twenty and four years,\r\nbehold, the kingdom was taken away from him. And he served many\r\nyears in captivity, yea, even all the remainder of his days.\r\n\r\nEther 10:31\r\n 31 And he begat Heth, and Heth lived in captivity all his days.\r\nAnd Heth begat Aaron, and Aaron dwelt in captivity all his days;\r\nand he begat Amnigaddah, and Amnigaddah also dwelt in captivity\r\nall his days; and he begat Coriantum, and Coriantum dwelt in\r\ncaptivity all his days; and he begat Com.\r\n\r\nEther 10:32\r\n 32 And it came to pass that Com drew away the half of the\r\nkingdom. And he reigned over the half of the kingdom forty and\r\ntwo years; and he went to battle against the king, Amgid, and\r\nthey fought for the space of many years, during which time Com\r\ngained power over Amgid, and obtained power over the remainder of\r\nthe kingdom.\r\n\r\nEther 10:33\r\n 33 And in the days of Com there began to be robbers in the land;\r\nand they adopted the old plans, and administered oaths after the\r\nmanner of the ancients, and sought again to destroy the kingdom.\r\n\r\nEther 10:34\r\n 34 Now Com did fight against them much; nevertheless, he did not\r\nprevail against them.\r\n\r\nEther 11\r\nChapter 11\r\n\r\nEther 11:1\r\n 1 And there came also in the days of Com many prophets, and\r\nprophesied of the destruction of that great people except they\r\nshould repent, and turn unto the Lord, and forsake their murders\r\nand wickedness.\r\n\r\nEther 11:2\r\n 2 And it came to pass that the prophets were rejected by the\r\npeople, and they fled unto Com for protection, for the people\r\nsought to destroy them.\r\n\r\nEther 11:3\r\n 3 And they prophesied unto Com many things; and he was blessed\r\nin all the remainder of his days.\r\n\r\nEther 11:4\r\n 4 And he lived to a good old age, and begat Shiblom; and Shiblom\r\nreigned in his stead. And the brother of Shiblom rebelled\r\nagainst him, and there began to be an exceedingly great war in\r\nall the land.\r\n\r\nEther 11:5\r\n 5 And it came to pass that the brother of Shiblom caused that\r\nall the prophets who prophesied of the destruction of the people\r\nshould be put to death;\r\n\r\nEther 11:6\r\n 6 And there was great calamity in all the land, for they had\r\ntestified that a great curse should come upon the land, and also\r\nupon the people, and that there should be a great destruction\r\namong them, such an one as never had been upon the face of the\r\nearth, and their bones should become as heaps of earth upon the\r\nface of the land except they should repent of their wickedness.\r\n\r\nEther 11:7\r\n 7 And they hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord, because of\r\ntheir wicked combinations; wherefore, there began to be wars and\r\ncontentions in all the land, and also many famines and\r\npestilences, insomuch that there was a great destruction, such an\r\none as never had been known upon the face of the earth; and all\r\nthis came to pass in the days of Shiblom.\r\n\r\nEther 11:8\r\n 8 And the people began to repent of their iniquity; and inasmuch\r\nas they did the Lord did have mercy on them.\r\n\r\nEther 11:9\r\n 9 And it came to pass that Shiblom was slain, and Seth was\r\nbrought into captivity, and did dwell in captivity all his days.\r\n\r\nEther 11:10\r\n 10 And it came to pass that Ahah, his son, did obtain the\r\nkingdom; and he did reign over the people all his days. And he\r\ndid do all manner of iniquity in his days, by which he did cause\r\nthe shedding of much blood; and few were his days.\r\n\r\nEther 11:11\r\n 11 And Ethem, being a descendant of Ahah, did obtain the\r\nkingdom; and he also did do that which was wicked in his days.\r\n\r\nEther 11:12\r\n 12 And it came to pass that in the days of Ethem there came many\r\nprophets, and prophesied again unto the people; yea, they did\r\nprophesy that the Lord would utterly destroy them from off the\r\nface of the earth except they repented of their iniquities.\r\n\r\nEther 11:13\r\n 13 And it came to pass that the people hardened their hearts,\r\nand would not hearken unto their words; and the prophets mourned\r\nand withdrew from among the people.\r\n\r\nEther 11:14\r\n 14 And it came to pass that Ethem did execute judgment in\r\nwickedness all his days; and he begat Moron. And it came to pass\r\nthat Moron did reign in his stead; and Moron did that which was\r\nwicked before the Lord.\r\n\r\nEther 11:15\r\n 15 And it came to pass that there arose a rebellion among the\r\npeople, because of that secret combination which was built up to\r\nget power and gain; and there arose a mighty man among them in\r\niniquity, and gave battle unto Moron, in which he did overthrow\r\nthe half of the kingdom; and he did maintain the half of the\r\nkingdom for many years.\r\n\r\nEther 11:16\r\n 16 And it came to pass that Moron did overthrow him, and did\r\nobtain the kingdom again.\r\n\r\nEther 11:17\r\n 17 And it came to pass that there arose another mighty man; and\r\nhe was a descendant of the brother of Jared.\r\n\r\nEther 11:18\r\n 18 And it came to pass that he did overthrow Moron and obtain\r\nthe kingdom; wherefore, Moron dwelt in captivity all the\r\nremainder of his days; and he begat Coriantor.\r\n\r\nEther 11:19\r\n 19 And it came to pass that Coriantor dwelt in captivity all his\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nEther 11:20\r\n 20 And in the days of Coriantor there also came many prophets,\r\nand prophesied of great and marvelous things, and cried\r\nrepentance unto the people, and except they should repent the\r\nLord God would execute judgment against them to their utter\r\ndestruction;\r\n\r\nEther 11:21\r\n 21 And that the Lord God would send or bring forth another\r\npeople to possess the land, by his power, after the manner by\r\nwhich he brought their fathers.\r\n\r\nEther 11:22\r\n 22 And they did reject all the words of the prophets, because of\r\ntheir secret society and wicked abominations.\r\n\r\nEther 11:23\r\n 23 And it came to pass that Coriantor begat Ether, and he died,\r\nhaving dwelt in captivity all his days.\r\n\r\nEther 12\r\nChapter 12\r\n\r\nEther 12:1\r\n 1 And it came to pass that the days of Ether were in the days of\r\nCoriantumr; and Coriantumr was king over all the land.\r\n\r\nEther 12:2\r\n 2 And Ether was a prophet of the Lord; wherefore Ether came\r\nforth in the days of Coriantumr, and began to prophesy unto the\r\npeople, for he could not be restrained because of the Spirit of\r\nthe Lord which was in him.\r\n\r\nEther 12:3\r\n 3 For he did cry from the morning, even until the going down of\r\nthe sun, exhorting the people to believe in God unto repentance\r\nlest they should be destroyed, saying unto them that by faith all\r\nthings are fulfilled--\r\n\r\nEther 12:4\r\n 4 Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a\r\nbetter world, yea, even a place at the right hand of God, which\r\nhope cometh of faith, maketh an anchor to the souls of men, which\r\nwould make them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good\r\nworks, being led to glorify God.\r\n\r\nEther 12:5\r\n 5 And it came to pass that Ether did prophesy great and\r\nmarvelous things unto the people, which they did not believe,\r\nbecause they saw them not.\r\n\r\nEther 12:6\r\n 6 And now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these\r\nthings; I would show unto the world that faith is things which\r\nare hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see\r\nnot, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nEther 12:7\r\n 7 For it was by faith that Christ showed himself unto our\r\nfathers, after he had risen from the dead; and he showed not\r\nhimself unto them until after they had faith in him; wherefore,\r\nit must needs be that some had faith in him, for he showed\r\nhimself not unto the world.\r\n\r\nEther 12:8\r\n 8 But because of the faith of men he has shown himself unto the\r\nworld, and glorified the name of the Father, and prepared a way\r\nthat thereby others might be partakers of the heavenly gift, that\r\nthey might hope for those things which they have not seen.\r\n\r\nEther 12:9\r\n 9 Wherefore, ye may also have hope, and be partakers of the\r\ngift, if ye will but have faith.\r\n\r\nEther 12:10\r\n 10 Behold it was by faith that they of old were called after the\r\nholy order of God.\r\n\r\nEther 12:11\r\n 11 Wherefore, by faith was the law of Moses given. But in the\r\ngift of his Son hath God prepared a more excellent way; and it is\r\nby faith that it hath been fulfilled.\r\n\r\nEther 12:12\r\n 12 For if there be no faith among the children of men God can do\r\nno miracle among them; wherefore, he showed not himself until\r\nafter their faith.\r\n\r\nEther 12:13\r\n 13 Behold, it was the faith of Alma and Amulek that caused the\r\nprison to tumble to the earth.\r\n\r\nEther 12:14\r\n 14 Behold, it was the faith of Nephi and Lehi that wrought the\r\nchange upon the Lamanites, that they were baptized with fire and\r\nwith the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\nEther 12:15\r\n 15 Behold, it was the faith of Ammon and his brethren which\r\nwrought so great a miracle among the Lamanites.\r\n\r\nEther 12:16\r\n 16 Yea, and even all they who wrought miracles wrought them by\r\nfaith, even those who were before Christ and also those who were\r\nafter.\r\n\r\nEther 12:17\r\n 17 And it was by faith that the three disciples obtained a\r\npromise that they should not taste of death; and they obtained\r\nnot the promise until after their faith.\r\n\r\nEther 12:18\r\n 18 And neither at any time hath any wrought miracles until after\r\ntheir faith; wherefore they first believed in the Son of God.\r\n\r\nEther 12:19\r\n 19 And there were many whose faith was so exceedingly strong,\r\neven before Christ came, who could not be kept from within the\r\nveil, but truly saw with their eyes the things which they had\r\nbeheld with an eye of faith, and they were glad.\r\n\r\nEther 12:20\r\n 20 And behold, we have seen in this record that one of these was\r\nthe brother of Jared; for so great was his faith in God, that\r\nwhen God put forth his finger he could not hide it from the sight\r\nof the brother of Jared, because of his word which he had spoken\r\nunto him, which word he had obtained by faith.\r\n\r\nEther 12:21\r\n 21 And after the brother of Jared had beheld the finger of the\r\nLord, because of the promise which the brother of Jared had\r\nobtained by faith, the Lord could not withhold anything from his\r\nsight; wherefore he showed him all things, for he could no longer\r\nbe kept without the veil.\r\n\r\nEther 12:22\r\n 22 And it is by faith that my fathers have obtained the promise\r\nthat these things should come unto their brethren through the\r\nGentiles; therefore the Lord hath commanded me, yea, even Jesus\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\nEther 12:23\r\n 23 And I said unto him: Lord, the Gentiles will mock at these\r\nthings, because of our weakness in writing; for Lord thou hast\r\nmade us mighty in word by faith, but thou hast not made us mighty\r\nin writing; for thou hast made all this people that they could\r\nspeak much, because of the Holy Ghost which thou hast given them;\r\n\r\nEther 12:24\r\n 24 And thou hast made us that we could write but little, because\r\nof the awkwardness of our hands. Behold, thou hast not made us\r\nmighty in writing like unto the brother of Jared, for thou madest\r\nhim that the things which he wrote were mighty even as thou art,\r\nunto the overpowering of man to read them.\r\n\r\nEther 12:25\r\n 25 Thou hast also made our words powerful and great, even that\r\nwe cannot write them; wherefore, when we write we behold our\r\nweakness, and stumble because of the placing of our words; and I\r\nfear lest the Gentiles shall mock at our words.\r\n\r\nEther 12:26\r\n 26 And when I had said this, the Lord spake unto me, saying:\r\nFools mock, but they shall mourn; and my grace is sufficient for\r\nthe meek, that they shall take no advantage of your weakness;\r\n\r\nEther 12:27\r\n 27 And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness.\r\nI give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is\r\nsufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if\r\nthey humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will\r\nI make weak things become strong unto them.\r\n\r\nEther 12:28\r\n 28 Behold, I will show unto the Gentiles their weakness and I\r\nwill show unto them that faith, hope and charity bringeth unto\r\nme--the fountain of all righteousness.\r\n\r\nEther 12:29\r\n 29 And I, Moroni, having heard these words, was comforted, and\r\nsaid: O Lord, thy righteous will be done, for I know that thou\r\nworkest unto the children of men according to their faith;\r\n\r\nEther 12:30\r\n 30 For the brother of Jared said unto the mountain Zerin,\r\nRemove--and it was removed. And if he had not had faith it would\r\nnot have moved; wherefore thou workest after men have faith.\r\n\r\nEther 12:31\r\n 31 For thus didst thou manifest thyself unto thy disciples; for\r\nafter they had faith, and did speak in thy name, thou didst show\r\nthyself unto them in great power.\r\n\r\nEther 12:32\r\n 32 And I also remember that thou hast said that thou hast\r\nprepared a house for man, yea, even among the mansions of thy\r\nFather, in which man might have a more excellent hope; wherefore\r\nman must hope, or he cannot receive an inheritance in the place\r\nwhich thou hast prepared.\r\n\r\nEther 12:33\r\n 33 And again, I remember that thou hast said that thou hast\r\nloved the world, even unto the laying down of thy life for the\r\nworld, that thou mightest take it again to prepare a place for\r\nthe children of men.\r\n\r\nEther 12:34\r\n 34 And now I know that this love which thou hast had for the\r\nchildren of men is charity; wherefore, except men shall have\r\ncharity they cannot inherit that place which thou hast prepared\r\nin the mansions of thy Father.\r\n\r\nEther 12:35\r\n 35 Wherefore, I know by this thing which thou hast said, that if\r\nthe Gentiles have not charity, because of our weakness, that thou\r\nwilt prove them, and take away their talent, yea, even that which\r\nthey have received, and give unto them who shall have more\r\nabundantly.\r\n\r\nEther 12:36\r\n 36 And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord that he would\r\ngive unto the Gentiles grace, that they might have charity.\r\n\r\nEther 12:37\r\n 37 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: If they have\r\nnot charity it mattereth not unto thee, thou hast been faithful;\r\nwherefore, thy garments shall be made clean. And because thou\r\nhast seen thy weakness thou shalt be made strong, even unto the\r\nsitting down in the place which I have prepared in the mansions\r\nof my Father.\r\n\r\nEther 12:38\r\n 38 And now I, Moroni, bid farewell unto the Gentiles, yea, and\r\nalso unto my brethren whom I love, until we shall meet before the\r\njudgment-seat of Christ, where all men shall know that my\r\ngarments are not spotted with your blood.\r\n\r\nEther 12:39\r\n 39 And then shall ye know that I have seen Jesus, and that he\r\nhath talked with me face to face, and that he told me in plain\r\nhumility, even as a man telleth another in mine own language,\r\nconcerning these things;\r\n\r\nEther 12:40\r\n 40 And only a few have I written, because of my weakness in\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nEther 12:41\r\n 41 And now, I would commend you to seek this Jesus of whom the\r\nprophets and apostles have written, that the grace of God the\r\nFather, and also the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, which\r\nbeareth record of them, may be and abide in you forever. Amen.\r\n\r\nEther 13\r\nChapter 13\r\n\r\nEther 13:1\r\n 1 And now I, Moroni, proceed to finish my record concerning the\r\ndestruction of the people of whom I have been writing.\r\n\r\nEther 13:2\r\n 2 For behold, they rejected all the words of Ether; for he truly\r\ntold them of all things, from the beginning of man; and that\r\nafter the waters had receded from off the face of this land it\r\nbecame a choice land above all other lands, a chosen land of the\r\nLord; wherefore the Lord would have that all men should serve him\r\nwho dwell upon the face thereof;\r\n\r\nEther 13:3\r\n 3 And that it was the place of the New Jerusalem, which should\r\ncome down out of heaven, and the holy sanctuary of the Lord.\r\n\r\nEther 13:4\r\n 4 Behold, Ether saw the days of Christ, and he spake concerning\r\na New Jerusalem upon this land.\r\n\r\nEther 13:5\r\n 5 And he spake also concerning the house of Israel, and the\r\nJerusalem from whence Lehi should come--after it should be\r\ndestroyed it should be built up again, a holy city unto the Lord;\r\nwherefore, it could not be a new Jerusalem for it had been in a\r\ntime of old; but it should be built up again, and become a holy\r\ncity of the Lord; and it should be built unto the house of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\nEther 13:6\r\n 6 And that a New Jerusalem should be built upon this land, unto\r\nthe remnant of the seed of Joseph, for which things there has\r\nbeen a type.\r\n\r\nEther 13:7\r\n 7 For as Joseph brought his father down into the land of Egypt,\r\neven so he died there; wherefore, the Lord brought a remnant of\r\nthe seed of Joseph out of the land of Jerusalem, that he might be\r\nmerciful unto the seed of Joseph that they should perish not,\r\neven as he was merciful unto the father of Joseph that he should\r\nperish not.\r\n\r\nEther 13:8\r\n 8 Wherefore, the remnant of the house of Joseph shall be built\r\nupon this land; and it shall be a land of their inheritance; and\r\nthey shall build up a holy city unto the Lord, like unto the\r\nJerusalem of old; and they shall no more be confounded, until the\r\nend come when the earth shall pass away.\r\n\r\nEther 13:9\r\n 9 And there shall be a new heaven and a new earth; and they\r\nshall be like unto the old save the old have passed away, and all\r\nthings have become new.\r\n\r\nEther 13:10\r\n 10 And then cometh the New Jerusalem; and blessed are they who\r\ndwell therein, for it is they whose garments are white through\r\nthe blood of the Lamb; and they are they who are numbered among\r\nthe remnant of the seed of Joseph, who were of the house of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\nEther 13:11\r\n 11 And then also cometh the Jerusalem of old; and the\r\ninhabitants thereof, blessed are they, for they have been washed\r\nin the blood of the Lamb; and they are they who were scattered\r\nand gathered in from the four quarters of the earth, and from the\r\nnorth countries, and are partakers of the fulfilling of the\r\ncovenant which God made with their father, Abraham.\r\n\r\nEther 13:12\r\n 12 And when these things come, bringeth to pass the scripture\r\nwhich saith, there are they who were first, who shall be last;\r\nand there are they who were last, who shall be first.\r\n\r\nEther 13:13\r\n 13 And I was about to write more, but I am forbidden; but great\r\nand marvelous were the prophecies of Ether; but they esteemed him\r\nas naught, and cast him out; and he hid himself in the cavity of\r\na rock by day, and by night he went forth viewing the things\r\nwhich should come upon the people.\r\n\r\nEther 13:14\r\n 14 And as he dwelt in the cavity of a rock he made the remainder\r\nof his record, viewing the destructions which came upon the\r\npeople, by night.\r\n\r\nEther 13:15\r\n 15 And it came to pass that in that same year in which he was\r\ncast out from among the people there began to be a great war\r\namong the people, for there were many who rose up, who were\r\nmighty men, and sought to destroy Coriantumr by their secret\r\nplans of wickedness, of which hath been spoken.\r\n\r\nEther 13:16\r\n 16 And now Coriantumr, having studied, himself, in all the arts\r\nof war and all the cunning of the world, wherefore he gave battle\r\nunto them who sought to destroy him.\r\n\r\nEther 13:17\r\n 17 But he repented not, neither his fair sons nor daughters;\r\nneither the fair sons and daughters of Cohor; neither the fair\r\nsons and daughters of Corihor; and in fine, there were none of\r\nthe fair sons and daughters upon the face of the whole earth who\r\nrepented of their sins.\r\n\r\nEther 13:18\r\n 18 Wherefore, it came to pass that in the first year that Ether\r\ndwelt in the cavity of a rock, there were many people who were\r\nslain by the sword of those secret combinations, fighting against\r\nCoriantumr that they might obtain the kingdom.\r\n\r\nEther 13:19\r\n 19 And it came to pass that the sons of Coriantumr fought much\r\nand bled much.\r\n\r\nEther 13:20\r\n 20 And in the second year the word of the Lord came to Ether,\r\nthat he should go and prophesy unto Coriantumr that, if he would\r\nrepent, and all his household, the Lord would give unto him his\r\nkingdom and spare the people--\r\n\r\nEther 13:21\r\n 21 Otherwise they should be destroyed, and all his household\r\nsave it were himself. And he should only live to see the\r\nfulfilling of the prophecies which had been spoken concerning\r\nanother people receiving the land for their inheritance; and\r\nCoriantumr should receive a burial by them; and every soul should\r\nbe destroyed save it were Coriantumr.\r\n\r\nEther 13:22\r\n 22 And it came to pass that Coriantumr repented not, neither his\r\nhousehold, neither the people; and the wars ceased not; and they\r\nsought to kill Ether, but he fled from before them and hid again\r\nin the cavity of the rock.\r\n\r\nEther 13:23\r\n 23 And it came to pass that there arose up Shared, and he also\r\ngave battle unto Coriantumr; and he did beat him, insomuch that\r\nin the third year he did bring him into captivity.\r\n\r\nEther 13:24\r\n 24 And the sons of Coriantumr, in the fourth year, did beat\r\nShared, and did obtain the kingdom again unto their father.\r\n\r\nEther 13:25\r\n 25 Now there began to be a war upon all the face of the land,\r\nevery man with his band fighting for that which he desired.\r\n\r\nEther 13:26\r\n 26 And there were robbers, and in fine, all manner of wickedness\r\nupon all the face of the land.\r\n\r\nEther 13:27\r\n 27 And it came to pass that Coriantumr was exceedingly angry\r\nwith Shared, and he went against him with his armies to battle;\r\nand they did meet in great anger, and they did meet in the valley\r\nof Gilgal; and the battle became exceedingly sore.\r\n\r\nEther 13:28\r\n 28 And it came to pass that Shared fought against him for the\r\nspace of three days. And it came to pass that Coriantumr beat\r\nhim, and did pursue him until he came to the plains of Heshlon.\r\n\r\nEther 13:29\r\n 29 And it came to pass that Shared gave him battle again upon\r\nthe plains; and behold, he did beat Coriantumr, and drove him\r\nback again to the valley of Gilgal.\r\n\r\nEther 13:30\r\n 30 And Coriantumr gave Shared battle again in the valley of\r\nGilgal, in which he beat Shared and slew him.\r\n\r\nEther 13:31\r\n 31 And Shared wounded Coriantumr in his thigh, that he did not\r\ngo to battle again for the space of two years, in which time all\r\nthe people upon the face of the land were shedding blood, and\r\nthere was none to restrain them.\r\n\r\nEther 14\r\nChapter 14\r\n\r\nEther 14:1\r\n 1 And now there began to be a great curse upon all the land\r\nbecause of the iniquity of the people, in which, if a man should\r\nlay his tool or his sword upon his shelf, or upon the place\r\nwhither he would keep it, behold, upon the morrow, he could not\r\nfind it, so great was the curse upon the land.\r\n\r\nEther 14:2\r\n 2 Wherefore every man did cleave unto that which was his own,\r\nwith his hands, and would not borrow neither would he lend; and\r\nevery man kept the hilt of his sword in his right hand, in the\r\ndefence of his property and his own life and of his wives and\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nEther 14:3\r\n 3 And now, after the space of two years, and after the death of\r\nShared, behold, there arose the brother of Shared and he gave\r\nbattle unto Coriantumr, in which Coriantumr did beat him and did\r\npursue him to the wilderness of Akish.\r\n\r\nEther 14:4\r\n 4 And it came to pass that the brother of Shared did give battle\r\nunto him in the wilderness of Akish; and the battle became\r\nexceedingly sore, and many thousands fell by the sword.\r\n\r\nEther 14:5\r\n 5 And it came to pass that Coriantumr did lay siege to the\r\nwilderness; and the brother of Shared did march forth out of the\r\nwilderness by night, and slew a part of the army of Coriantumr,\r\nas they were drunken.\r\n\r\nEther 14:6\r\n 6 And he came forth to the land of Moron, and placed himself\r\nupon the throne of Coriantumr.\r\n\r\nEther 14:7\r\n 7 And it came to pass that Coriantumr dwelt with his army in the\r\nwilderness for the space of two years, in which he did receive\r\ngreat strength to his army.\r\n\r\nEther 14:8\r\n 8 Now the brother of Shared, whose name was Gilead, also\r\nreceived great strength to his army, because of secret\r\ncombinations.\r\n\r\nEther 14:9\r\n 9 And it came to pass that his high priest murdered him as he\r\nsat upon his throne.\r\n\r\nEther 14:10\r\n 10 And it came to pass that one of the secret combinations\r\nmurdered him in a secret pass, and obtained unto himself the\r\nkingdom; and his name was Lib; and Lib was a man of great\r\nstature, more than any other man among all the people.\r\n\r\nEther 14:11\r\n 11 And it came to pass that in the first year of Lib, Coriantumr\r\ncame up unto the land of Moron, and gave battle unto Lib.\r\n\r\nEther 14:12\r\n 12 And it came to pass that he fought with Lib, in which Lib did\r\nsmite upon his arm that he was wounded; nevertheless, the army of\r\nCoriantumr did press forward upon Lib, that he fled to the\r\nborders upon the seashore.\r\n\r\nEther 14:13\r\n 13 And it came to pass that Coriantumr pursued him; and Lib gave\r\nbattle unto him upon the seashore.\r\n\r\nEther 14:14\r\n 14 And it came to pass that Lib did smite the army of\r\nCoriantumr, that they fled again to the wilderness of Akish.\r\n\r\nEther 14:15\r\n 15 And it came to pass that Lib did pursue him until he came to\r\nthe plains of Agosh. And Coriantumr had taken all the people\r\nwith him as he fled before Lib in that quarter of the land\r\nwhither he fled.\r\n\r\nEther 14:16\r\n 16 And when he had come to the plains of Agosh he gave battle\r\nunto Lib, and he smote upon him until he died; nevertheless, the\r\nbrother of Lib did come against Coriantumr in the stead thereof,\r\nand the battle became exceedingly sore, in the which Coriantumr\r\nfled again before the army of the brother of Lib.\r\n\r\nEther 14:17\r\n 17 Now the name of the brother of Lib was called Shiz. And it\r\ncame to pass that Shiz pursued after Coriantumr, and he did\r\noverthrow many cities, and he did slay both women and children,\r\nand he did burn the cities.\r\n\r\nEther 14:18\r\n 18 And there went a fear of Shiz throughout all the land; yea, a\r\ncry went forth throughout the land--Who can stand before the army\r\nof Shiz? Behold, he sweepeth the earth before him!\r\n\r\nEther 14:19\r\n 19 And it came to pass that the people began to flock together\r\nin armies, throughout all the face of the land.\r\n\r\nEther 14:20\r\n 20 And they were divided; and a part of them fled to the army of\r\nShiz, and a part of them fled to the army of Coriantumr.\r\n\r\nEther 14:21\r\n 21 And so great and lasting had been the war, and so long had\r\nbeen the scene of bloodshed and carnage, that the whole face of\r\nthe land was covered with the bodies of the dead.\r\n\r\nEther 14:22\r\n 22 And so swift and speedy was the war that there was none left\r\nto bury the dead, but they did march forth from the shedding of\r\nblood to the shedding of blood, leaving the bodies of both men,\r\nwomen, and children strewed upon the face of the land, to become\r\na prey to the worms of the flesh.\r\n\r\nEther 14:23\r\n 23 And the scent thereof went forth upon the face of the land,\r\neven upon all the face of the land; wherefore the people became\r\ntroubled by day and by night, because of the scent thereof.\r\n\r\nEther 14:24\r\n 24 Nevertheless, Shiz did not cease to pursue Coriantumr; for he\r\nhad sworn to avenge himself upon Coriantumr of the blood of his\r\nbrother, who had been slain, and the word of the Lord which came\r\nto Ether that Coriantumr should not fall by the sword.\r\n\r\nEther 14:25\r\n 25 And thus we see that the Lord did visit them in the fulness\r\nof his wrath, and their wickedness and abominations had prepared\r\na way for their everlasting destruction.\r\n\r\nEther 14:26\r\n 26 And it came to pass that Shiz did pursue Coriantumr eastward,\r\neven to the borders by the seashore, and there he gave battle\r\nunto Shiz for the space of three days.\r\n\r\nEther 14:27\r\n 27 And so terrible was the destruction among the armies of Shiz\r\nthat the people began to be frightened, and began to flee before\r\nthe armies of Coriantumr; and they fled to the land of Corihor,\r\nand swept off the inhabitants before them, all them that would\r\nnot join them.\r\n\r\nEther 14:28\r\n 28 And they pitched their tents in the valley of Corihor; and\r\nCoriantumr pitched his tents in the valley of Shurr. Now the\r\nvalley of Shurr was near the hill Comnor; wherefore, Coriantumr\r\ndid gather his armies together upon the hill Comnor, and did\r\nsound a trumpet unto the armies of Shiz to invite them forth to\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nEther 14:29\r\n 29 And it came to pass that they came forth, but were driven\r\nagain; and they came the second time, and they were driven again\r\nthe second time. And it came to pass that they came again the\r\nthird time, and the battle became exceedingly sore.\r\n\r\nEther 14:30\r\n 30 And it came to pass that Shiz smote upon Coriantumr that he\r\ngave him many deep wounds; and Coriantumr, having lost his blood,\r\nfainted, and was carried away as though he were dead.\r\n\r\nEther 14:31\r\n 31 Now the loss of men, women and children on both sides was so\r\ngreat that Shiz commanded his people that they should not pursue\r\nthe armies of Coriantumr; wherefore, they returned to their camp.\r\n\r\nEther 15\r\nChapter 15\r\n\r\nEther 15:1\r\n 1 And it came to pass when Coriantumr had recovered of his\r\nwounds, he began to remember the words which Ether had spoken\r\nunto him.\r\n\r\nEther 15:2\r\n 2 He saw that there had been slain by the sword already nearly\r\ntwo millions of his people, and he began to sorrow in his heart;\r\nyea, there had been slain two millions of mighty men, and also\r\ntheir wives and their children.\r\n\r\nEther 15:3\r\n 3 He began to repent of the evil which he had done; he began to\r\nremember the words which had been spoken by the mouth of all the\r\nprophets, and he saw them that they were fulfilled thus far,\r\nevery whit; and his soul mourned and refused to be comforted.\r\n\r\nEther 15:4\r\n 4 And it came to pass that he wrote an epistle unto Shiz,\r\ndesiring him that he would spare the people, and he would give up\r\nthe kingdom for the sake of the lives of the people.\r\n\r\nEther 15:5\r\n 5 And it came to pass that when Shiz had received his epistle he\r\nwrote an epistle unto Coriantumr, that if he would give himself\r\nup, that he might slay him with his own sword, that he would\r\nspare the lives of the people.\r\n\r\nEther 15:6\r\n 6 And it came to pass that the people repented not of their\r\niniquity; and the people of Coriantumr were stirred up to anger\r\nagainst the people of Shiz; and the people of Shiz were stirred\r\nup to anger against the people of Coriantumr; wherefore, the\r\npeople of Shiz did give battle unto the people of Coriantumr.\r\n\r\nEther 15:7\r\n 7 And when Coriantumr saw that he was about to fall he fled\r\nagain before the people of Shiz.\r\n\r\nEther 15:8\r\n 8 And it came to pass that he came to the waters of Ripliancum,\r\nwhich, by interpretation, is large, or to exceed all; wherefore,\r\nwhen they came to these waters they pitched their tents; and Shiz\r\nalso pitched his tents near unto them; and therefore on the\r\nmorrow they did come to battle.\r\n\r\nEther 15:9\r\n 9 And it came to pass that they fought an exceedingly sore\r\nbattle, in which Coriantumr was wounded again, and he fainted\r\nwith the loss of blood.\r\n\r\nEther 15:10\r\n 10 And it came to pass that the armies of Coriantumr did press\r\nupon the armies of Shiz that they beat them, that they caused\r\nthem to flee before them; and they did flee southward, and did\r\npitch their tents in a place which was called Ogath.\r\n\r\nEther 15:11\r\n 11 And it came to pass that the army of Coriantumr did pitch\r\ntheir tents by the hill Ramah; and it was that same hill where my\r\nfather Mormon did hide up the records unto the Lord, which were\r\nsacred.\r\n\r\nEther 15:12\r\n 12 And it came to pass that they did gather together all the\r\npeople upon all the face of the land, who had not been slain,\r\nsave it was Ether.\r\n\r\nEther 15:13\r\n 13 And it came to pass that Ether did behold all the doings of\r\nthe people; and he beheld that the people who were for Coriantumr\r\nwere gathered together to the army of Coriantumr; and the people\r\nwho were for Shiz were gathered together to the army of Shiz.\r\n\r\nEther 15:14\r\n 14 Wherefore, they were for the space of four years gathering\r\ntogether the people, that they might get all who were upon the\r\nface of the land, and that they might receive all the strength\r\nwhich it was possible that they could receive.\r\n\r\nEther 15:15\r\n 15 And it came to pass that when they were all gathered\r\ntogether, every one to the army which he would, with their wives\r\nand their children--both men women and children being armed with\r\nweapons of war, having shields, and breastplates, and\r\nhead-plates, and being clothed after the manner of war--they did\r\nmarch forth one against another to battle; and they fought all\r\nthat day, and conquered not.\r\n\r\nEther 15:16\r\n 16 And it came to pass that when it was night they were weary,\r\nand retired to their camps; and after they had retired to their\r\ncamps they took up a howling and a lamentation for the loss of\r\nthe slain of their people; and so great were their cries, their\r\nhowlings and lamentations, that they did rend the air\r\nexceedingly.\r\n\r\nEther 15:17\r\n 17 And it came to pass that on the morrow they did go again to\r\nbattle, and great and terrible was that day; nevertheless, they\r\nconquered not, and when the night came again they did rend the\r\nair with their cries, and their howlings, and their mournings,\r\nfor the loss of the slain of their people.\r\n\r\nEther 15:18\r\n 18 And it came to pass that Coriantumr wrote again an epistle\r\nunto Shiz, desiring that he would not come again to battle, but\r\nthat he would take the kingdom, and spare the lives of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nEther 15:19\r\n 19 And behold, the Spirit of the Lord had ceased striving with\r\nthem, and Satan had full power over the hearts of the people; for\r\nthey were given up unto the hardness of their hearts, and the\r\nblindness of their minds that they might be destroyed; wherefore\r\nthey went again to battle.\r\n\r\nEther 15:20\r\n 20 And it came to pass that they fought all that day, and when\r\nthe night came they slept upon their swords.\r\n\r\nEther 15:21\r\n 21 And on the morrow they fought even until the night came.\r\n\r\nEther 15:22\r\n 22 And when the night came they were drunken with anger, even as\r\na man who is drunken with wine; and they slept again upon their\r\nswords.\r\n\r\nEther 15:23\r\n 23 And on the morrow they fought again; and when the night came\r\nthey had all fallen by the sword save it were fifty and two of\r\nthe people of Coriantumr, and sixty and nine of the people of\r\nShiz.\r\n\r\nEther 15:24\r\n 24 And it came to pass that they slept upon their swords that\r\nnight, and on the morrow they fought again, and they contended in\r\ntheir might with their swords and with their shields, all that\r\nday.\r\n\r\nEther 15:25\r\n 25 And when the night came there were thirty and two of the\r\npeople of Shiz, and twenty and seven of the people of Coriantumr.\r\n\r\nEther 15:26\r\n 26 And it came to pass that they ate and slept, and prepared for\r\ndeath on the morrow. And they were large and mighty men as to\r\nthe strength of men.\r\n\r\nEther 15:27\r\n 27 And it came to pass that they fought for the space of three\r\nhours, and they fainted with the loss of blood.\r\n\r\nEther 15:28\r\n 28 And it came to pass that when the men of Coriantumr had\r\nreceived sufficient strength that they could walk, they were\r\nabout to flee for their lives; but behold, Shiz arose, and also\r\nhis men, and he swore in his wrath that he would slay Coriantumr\r\nor he would perish by the sword.\r\n\r\nEther 15:29\r\n 29 Wherefore, he did pursue them, and on the morrow he did\r\novertake them; and they fought again with the sword. And it came\r\nto pass that when they had all fallen by the sword, save it were\r\nCoriantumr and Shiz, behold Shiz had fainted with the loss of\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nEther 15:30\r\n 30 And it came to pass that when Coriantumr had leaned upon his\r\nsword, that he rested a little, he smote off the head of Shiz.\r\n\r\nEther 15:31\r\n 31 And it came to pass that after he had smitten off the head of\r\nShiz, that Shiz raised upon his hands and fell; and after that he\r\nhad struggled for breath, he died.\r\n\r\nEther 15:32\r\n 32 And it came to pass that Coriantumr fell to the earth, and\r\nbecame as if he had no life.\r\n\r\nEther 15:33\r\n 33 And the Lord spake unto Ether, and said unto him: Go forth.\r\nAnd he went forth, and beheld that the words of the Lord had all\r\nbeen fulfilled; and he finished his record; (and the hundredth\r\npart I have not written) and he hid them in a manner that the\r\npeople of Limhi did find them.\r\n\r\nEther 15:34\r\n 34 Now the last words which are written by Ether are these:\r\nWhether the Lord will that I be translated, or that I suffer the\r\nwill of the Lord in the flesh, it mattereth not, if it so be that\r\nI am saved in the kingdom of God. Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOOK OF MORONI\r\n\r\nMoroni 1\r\nChapter 1\r\n\r\nMoroni 1:1\r\n 1 Now I, Moroni, after having made an end of abridging the\r\naccount of the people of Jared, I had supposed not to have\r\nwritten more, but I have not as yet perished; and I make not\r\nmyself known to the Lamanites lest they should destroy me.\r\n\r\nMoroni 1:2\r\n 2 For behold, their wars are exceedingly fierce among\r\nthemselves; and because of their hatred they put to death every\r\nNephite that will not deny the Christ.\r\n\r\nMoroni 1:3\r\n 3 And I, Moroni, will not deny the Christ; wherefore, I wander\r\nwhithersoever I can for the safety of mine own life.\r\n\r\nMoroni 1:4\r\n 4 Wherefore, I write a few more things, contrary to that which I\r\nhad supposed; for I had supposed not to have written any more;\r\nbut I write a few more things, that perhaps they may be of worth\r\nunto my brethren, the Lamanites, in some future day, according to\r\nthe will of the Lord.\r\n\r\nMoroni 2\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\nMoroni 2:1\r\n 1 The words of Christ, which he spake unto his disciples, the\r\ntwelve whom he had chosen, as he laid his hands upon them--\r\n\r\nMoroni 2:2\r\n 2 And he called them by name, saying: Ye shall call on the\r\nFather in my name, in mighty prayer; and after ye have done this\r\nye shall have power that to him upon whom ye shall lay your\r\nhands, ye shall give the Holy Ghost; and in my name shall ye give\r\nit, for thus do mine apostles.\r\n\r\nMoroni 2:3\r\n 3 Now Christ spake these words unto them at the time of his\r\nfirst appearing; and the multitude heard it not, but the\r\ndisciples heard it; and on as many as they laid their hands, fell\r\nthe Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\nMoroni 3\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\nMoroni 3:1\r\n 1 The manner which the disciples, who were called the elders of\r\nthe church, ordained priests and teachers--\r\n\r\nMoroni 3:2\r\n 2 After they had prayed unto the Father in the name of Christ,\r\nthey laid their hands upon them, and said:\r\n\r\nMoroni 3:3\r\n 3 In the name of Jesus Christ I ordain you to be a priest, (or,\r\nif he be a teacher) I ordain you to be a teacher, to preach\r\nrepentance and remission of sins through Jesus Christ, by the\r\nendurance of faith on his name to the end. Amen.\r\n\r\nMoroni 3:4\r\n 4 And after this manner did they ordain priests and teachers,\r\naccording to the gifts and callings of God unto men; and they\r\nordained them by the power of the Holy Ghost, which was in them.\r\n\r\nMoroni 4\r\nChapter 4\r\n\r\nMoroni 4:1\r\n 1 The manner of their elders and priests administering the flesh\r\nand blood of Christ unto the church; and they administered it\r\naccording to the commandments of Christ; wherefore we know the\r\nmanner to be true; and the elder or priest did minister it--\r\n\r\nMoroni 4:2\r\n 2 And they did kneel down with the church, and pray to the\r\nFather in the name of Christ, saying:\r\n\r\nMoroni 4:3\r\n 3 O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son,\r\nJesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of\r\nall those who partake of it; that they may eat in remembrance of\r\nthe body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal\r\nFather, that they are willing to take upon them the name of thy\r\nSon, and always remember him, and keep his commandments which he\r\nhath given them, that they may always have his Spirit to be with\r\nthem. Amen.\r\n\r\nMoroni 5\r\nChapter 5\r\n\r\nMoroni 5:1\r\n 1 The manner of administering the wine--Behold, they took the\r\ncup, and said:\r\n\r\nMoroni 5:2\r\n 2 O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee, in the name of thy\r\nSon, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this wine to the souls\r\nof all those who drink of it, that they may do it in remembrance\r\nof the blood of thy Son, which was shed for them; that they may\r\nwitness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they do always\r\nremember him, that they may have his Spirit to be with them.\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nMoroni 6\r\nChapter 6\r\n\r\nMoroni 6:1\r\n 1 And now I speak concerning baptism. Behold, elders, priests,\r\nand teachers were baptized; and they were not baptized save they\r\nbrought forth fruit meet that they were worthy of it.\r\n\r\nMoroni 6:2\r\n 2 Neither did they receive any unto baptism save they came forth\r\nwith a broken heart and a contrite spirit, and witnessed unto the\r\nchurch that they truly repented of all their sins.\r\n\r\nMoroni 6:3\r\n 3 And none were received unto baptism save they took upon them\r\nthe name of Christ, having a determination to serve him to the\r\nend.\r\n\r\nMoroni 6:4\r\n 4 And after they had been received unto baptism, and were\r\nwrought upon and cleansed by the power of the Holy Ghost, they\r\nwere numbered among the people of the church of Christ; and their\r\nnames were taken, that they might be remembered and nourished by\r\nthe good word of God, to keep them in the right way, to keep them\r\ncontinually watchful unto prayer, relying alone upon the merits\r\nof Christ, who was the author and the finisher of their faith.\r\n\r\nMoroni 6:5\r\n 5 And the church did meet together oft, to fast and to pray, and\r\nto speak one with another concerning the welfare of their souls.\r\n\r\nMoroni 6:6\r\n 6 And they did meet together oft to partake of bread and wine,\r\nin remembrance of the Lord Jesus.\r\n\r\nMoroni 6:7\r\n 7 And they were strict to observe that there should be no\r\niniquity among them; and whoso was found to commit iniquity, and\r\nthree witnesses of the church did condemn them before the elders,\r\nand if they repented not, and confessed not, their names were\r\nblotted out, and they were not numbered among the people of\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\nMoroni 6:8\r\n 8 But as oft as they repented and sought forgiveness, with real\r\nintent, they were forgiven.\r\n\r\nMoroni 6:9\r\n 9 And their meetings were conducted by the church after the\r\nmanner of the workings of the Spirit, and by the power of the\r\nHoly Ghost; for as the power of the Holy Ghost led them whether\r\nto preach, or to exhort, or to pray, or to supplicate, or to\r\nsing, even so it was done.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:1\r\n 1 And now I, Moroni, write a few of the words of my father\r\nMormon, which he spake concerning faith, hope, and charity; for\r\nafter this manner did he speak unto the people, as he taught them\r\nin the synagogue which they had built for the place of worship.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:2\r\n 2 And now I, Mormon, speak unto you, my beloved brethren; and it\r\nis by the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, and\r\nhis holy will, because of the gift of his calling unto me, that I\r\nam permitted to speak unto you at this time.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:3\r\n 3 Wherefore, I would speak unto you that are of the church, that\r\nare the peaceable followers of Christ, and that have obtained a\r\nsufficient hope by which ye can enter into the rest of the Lord,\r\nfrom this time henceforth until ye shall rest with him in heaven.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:4\r\n 4 And now my brethren, I judge these things of you because of\r\nyour peaceable walk with the children of men.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:5\r\n 5 For I remember the word of God, which saith by their works ye\r\nshall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:6\r\n 6 For behold, God hath said a man being evil cannot do that\r\nwhich is good; for if he offereth a gift, or prayeth unto God,\r\nexcept he shall do it with real intent it profiteth him nothing.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:7\r\n 7 For behold, it is not counted unto him for righteousness.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:8\r\n 8 For behold, if a man being evil giveth a gift, he doeth it\r\ngrudgingly; wherefore it is counted unto him the same as if he\r\nhad retained the gift; wherefore he is counted evil before God.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:9\r\n 9 And likewise also is it counted evil unto a man, if he shall\r\npray and not with real intent of heart; yea, and it profiteth him\r\nnothing, for God receiveth none such.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:10\r\n 10 Wherefore, a man being evil cannot do that which is good;\r\nneither will he give a good gift.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:11\r\n 11 For behold, a bitter fountain cannot bring forth good water;\r\nneither can a good fountain bring forth bitter water; wherefore,\r\na man being a servant of the devil cannot follow Christ; and if\r\nhe follow Christ he cannot be a servant of the devil.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:12\r\n 12 Wherefore, all things which are good cometh of God; and that\r\nwhich is evil cometh of the devil; for the devil is an enemy unto\r\nGod, and fighteth against him continually, and inviteth and\r\nenticeth to sin, and to do that which is evil continually.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:13\r\n 13 But behold, that which is of God inviteth and enticeth to do\r\ngood continually; wherefore, every thing which inviteth and\r\nenticeth to do good, and to love God, and to serve him, is\r\ninspired of God.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:14\r\n 14 Wherefore, take heed, my beloved brethren, that ye do not\r\njudge that which is evil to be of God, or that which is good and\r\nof God to be of the devil.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:15\r\n 15 For behold, my brethren, it is given unto you to judge, that\r\nye may know good from evil; and the way to judge is as plain,\r\nthat ye may know with a perfect knowledge, as the daylight is\r\nfrom the dark night.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:16\r\n 16 For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that\r\nhe may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to\r\njudge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade\r\nto believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of\r\nChrist; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:17\r\n 17 But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe\r\nnot in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know\r\nwith a perfect knowledge it is of the devil; for after this\r\nmanner doth the devil work, for he persuadeth no man to do good,\r\nno, not one; neither do his angels; neither do they who subject\r\nthemselves unto him.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:18\r\n 18 And now, my brethren, seeing that ye know the light by which\r\nye may judge, which light is the light of Christ, see that ye do\r\nnot judge wrongfully; for with that same judgment which ye judge\r\nye shall also be judged.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:19\r\n 19 Wherefore, I beseech of you, brethren, that ye should search\r\ndiligently in the light of Christ that ye may know good from\r\nevil; and if ye will lay hold upon every good thing, and condemn\r\nit not, ye certainly will be a child of Christ.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:20\r\n 20 And now, my brethren, how is it possible that ye can lay hold\r\nupon every good thing?\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:21\r\n 21 And now I come to that faith, of which I said I would speak;\r\nand I will tell you the way whereby ye may lay hold on every good\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:22\r\n 22 For behold, God knowing all things, being from everlasting to\r\neverlasting, behold, he sent angels to minister unto the children\r\nof men, to make manifest concerning the coming of Christ; and in\r\nChrist there should come every good thing.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:23\r\n 23 And God also declared unto prophets, by his own mouth, that\r\nChrist should come.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:24\r\n 24 And behold, there were divers ways that he did manifest\r\nthings unto the children of men, which were good; and all things\r\nwhich are good cometh of Christ; otherwise men were fallen, and\r\nthere could no good thing come unto them.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:25\r\n 25 Wherefore, by the ministering of angels, and by every word\r\nwhich proceeded forth out of the mouth of God, men began to\r\nexercise faith in Christ; and thus by faith, they did lay hold\r\nupon every good thing; and thus it was until the coming of\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:26\r\n 26 And after that he came men also were saved by faith in his\r\nname; and by faith, they become the sons of God. And as sure as\r\nChrist liveth he spake these words unto our fathers, saying:\r\nWhatsoever thing ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is\r\ngood, in faith believing that ye shall receive, behold, it shall\r\nbe done unto you.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:27\r\n 27 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, have miracles ceased because\r\nChrist hath ascended into heaven, and hath sat down on the right\r\nhand of God, to claim of the Father his rights of mercy which he\r\nhath upon the children of men?\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:28\r\n 28 For he hath answered the ends of the law, and he claimeth all\r\nthose who have faith in him; and they who have faith in him will\r\ncleave unto every good thing; wherefore he advocateth the cause\r\nof the children of men; and he dwelleth eternally in the heavens.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:29\r\n 29 And because he hath done this, my beloved brethren, have\r\nmiracles ceased? Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither have angels\r\nceased to minister unto the children of men.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:30\r\n 30 For behold, they are subject unto him, to minister according\r\nto the word of his command, showing themselves unto them of\r\nstrong faith and a firm mind in every form of godliness.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:31\r\n 31 And the office of their ministry is to call men unto\r\nrepentance, and to fulfill and to do the work of the covenants of\r\nthe Father, which he hath made unto the children of men, to\r\nprepare the way among the children of men, by declaring the word\r\nof Christ unto the chosen vessels of the Lord, that they may bear\r\ntestimony of him.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:32\r\n 32 And by so doing, the Lord God prepareth the way that the\r\nresidue of men may have faith in Christ, that the Holy Ghost may\r\nhave place in their hearts, according to the power thereof; and\r\nafter this manner bringeth to pass the Father, the covenants\r\nwhich he hath made unto the children of men.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:33\r\n 33 And Christ hath said: If ye will have faith in me ye shall\r\nhave power to do whatsoever thing is expedient in me.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:34\r\n 34 And he hath said: Repent all ye ends of the earth, and come\r\nunto me, and be baptized in my name, and have faith in me, that\r\nye may be saved.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:35\r\n 35 And now, my beloved brethren, if this be the case that these\r\nthings are true which I have spoken unto you, and God will show\r\nunto you, with power and great glory at the last day, that they\r\nare true, and if they are true has the day of miracles ceased?\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:36\r\n 36 Or have angels ceased to appear unto the children of men? Or\r\nhas he withheld the power of the Holy Ghost from them? Or will\r\nhe, so long as time shall last, or the earth shall stand, or\r\nthere shall be one man upon the face thereof to be saved?\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:37\r\n 37 Behold I say unto you, Nay; for it is by faith that miracles\r\nare wrought; and it is by faith that angels appear and minister\r\nunto men; wherefore, if these things have ceased wo be unto the\r\nchildren of men, for it is because of unbelief, and all is vain.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:38\r\n 38 For no man can be saved, according to the words of Christ,\r\nsave they shall have faith in his name; wherefore, if these\r\nthings have ceased, then has faith ceased also; and awful is the\r\nstate of man, for they are as though there had been no redemption\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:39\r\n 39 But behold, my beloved brethren, I judge better things of\r\nyou, for I judge that ye have faith in Christ because of your\r\nmeekness; for if ye have not faith in him then ye are not fit to\r\nbe numbered among the people of his church.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:40\r\n 40 And again, my beloved brethren, I would speak unto you\r\nconcerning hope. How is it that ye can attain unto faith, save\r\nye shall have hope?\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:41\r\n 41 And what is it that ye shall hope for? Behold I say unto you\r\nthat ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ and the\r\npower of his resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal, and\r\nthis because of your faith in him according to the promise.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:42\r\n 42 Wherefore, if a man have faith he must needs have hope; for\r\nwithout faith there cannot be any hope.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:43\r\n 43 And again, behold I say unto you that he cannot have faith\r\nand hope, save he shall be meek, and lowly of heart.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:44\r\n 44 If so, his faith and hope is vain, for none is acceptable\r\nbefore God, save the meek and lowly in heart; and if a man be\r\nmeek and lowly in heart, and confesses by the power of the Holy\r\nGhost that Jesus is the Christ, he must needs have charity; for\r\nif he have not charity he is nothing; wherefore he must needs\r\nhave charity.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:45\r\n 45 And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and\r\nis not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked,\r\nthinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in\r\nthe truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all\r\nthings, endureth all things.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:46\r\n 46 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye\r\nare nothing, for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto\r\ncharity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail--\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:47\r\n 47 But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth\r\nforever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it\r\nshall be well with him.\r\n\r\nMoroni 7:48\r\n 48 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all\r\nthe energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which\r\nhe hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son,\r\nJesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he\r\nshall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is;\r\nthat we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is\r\npure. Amen.\r\n\r\nMoroni 8\r\nChapter 8\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:1\r\n 1 An epistle of my father Mormon, written to me, Moroni; and it\r\nwas written unto me soon after my calling to the ministry. And\r\non this wise did he write unto me, saying:\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:2\r\n 2 My beloved son, Moroni, I rejoice exceedingly that your Lord\r\nJesus Christ hath been mindful of you, and hath called you to his\r\nministry, and to his holy work.\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:3\r\n 3 I am mindful of you always in my prayers, continually praying\r\nunto God the Father in the name of his Holy Child, Jesus, that\r\nhe, through his infinite goodness and grace, will keep you\r\nthrough the endurance of faith on his name to the end.\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:4\r\n 4 And now, my son, I speak unto you concerning that which\r\ngrieveth me exceedingly; for it grieveth me that there should\r\ndisputations rise among you.\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:5\r\n 5 For, if I have learned the truth, there have been disputations\r\namong you concerning the baptism of your little children.\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:6\r\n 6 And now, my son, I desire that ye should labor diligently,\r\nthat this gross error should be removed from among you; for, for\r\nthis intent I have written this epistle.\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:7\r\n 7 For immediately after I had learned these things of you I\r\ninquired of the Lord concerning the matter. And the word of the\r\nLord came to me by the power of the Holy Ghost, saying:\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:8\r\n 8 Listen to the words of Christ, your Redeemer, your Lord and\r\nyour God. Behold, I came into the world not to call the\r\nrighteous but sinners to repentance; the whole need no physician,\r\nbut they that are sick; wherefore, little children are whole, for\r\nthey are not capable of committing sin; wherefore the curse of\r\nAdam is taken from them in me, that it hath no power over them;\r\nand the law of circumcision is done away in me.\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:9\r\n 9 And after this manner did the Holy Ghost manifest the word of\r\nGod unto me; wherefore, my beloved son, I know that it is solemn\r\nmockery before God, that ye should baptize little children.\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:10\r\n 10 Behold I say unto you that this thing shall ye\r\nteach--repentance and baptism unto those who are accountable and\r\ncapable of committing sin; yea, teach parents that they must\r\nrepent and be baptized, and humble themselves as their little\r\nchildren, and they shall all be saved with their little children.\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:11\r\n 11 And their little children need no repentance, neither\r\nbaptism. Behold, baptism is unto repentance to the fulfilling\r\nthe commandments unto the remission of sins.\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:12\r\n 12 But little children are alive in Christ, even from the\r\nfoundation of the world; if not so, God is a partial God, and\r\nalso a changeable God, and a respecter to persons; for how many\r\nlittle children have died without baptism!\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:13\r\n 13 Wherefore, if little children could not be saved without\r\nbaptism, these must have gone to an endless hell.\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:14\r\n 14 Behold I say unto you, that he that supposeth that little\r\nchildren need baptism is in the gall of bitterness and in the\r\nbonds of iniquity, for he hath neither faith, hope, nor charity;\r\nwherefore, should he be cut off while in the thought, he must go\r\ndown to hell.\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:15\r\n 15 For awful is the wickedness to suppose that God saveth one\r\nchild because of baptism, and the other must perish because he\r\nhath no baptism.\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:16\r\n 16 Wo be unto them that shall pervert the ways of the Lord after\r\nthis manner, for they shall perish except they repent. Behold, I\r\nspeak with boldness, having authority from God; and I fear not\r\nwhat man can do; for perfect love casteth out all fear.\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:17\r\n 17 And I am filled with charity, which is everlasting love;\r\nwherefore, all children are alike unto me; wherefore, I love\r\nlittle children with a perfect love; and they are all alike and\r\npartakers of salvation.\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:18\r\n 18 For I know that God is not a partial God, neither a\r\nchangeable being; but he is unchangeable from all eternity to all\r\neternity.\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:19\r\n 19 Little children cannot repent; wherefore, it is awful\r\nwickedness to deny the pure mercies of God unto them, for they\r\nare all alive in him because of his mercy.\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:20\r\n 20 And he that saith that little children need baptism denieth\r\nthe mercies of Christ, and setteth at naught the atonement of him\r\nand the power of his redemption.\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:21\r\n 21 Wo unto such, for they are in danger of death, hell, and an\r\nendless torment. I speak it boldly; God hath commanded me.\r\nListen unto them and give heed, or they stand against you at the\r\njudgment-seat of Christ.\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:22\r\n 22 For behold that all little children are alive in Christ, and\r\nalso all they that are without the law. For the power of\r\nredemption cometh on all them that have no law; wherefore, he\r\nthat is not condemned, or he that is under no condemnation,\r\ncannot repent; and unto such baptism availeth nothing--\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:23\r\n 23 But it is mockery before God, denying the mercies of Christ,\r\nand the power of his Holy Spirit, and putting trust in dead\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:24\r\n 24 Behold, my son, this thing ought not to be; for repentance is\r\nunto them that are under condemnation and under the curse of a\r\nbroken law.\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:25\r\n 25 And the first fruits of repentance is baptism; and baptism\r\ncometh by faith unto the fulfilling the commandments; and the\r\nfulfilling the commandments bringeth remission of sins;\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:26\r\n 26 And the remission of sins bringeth meekness, and lowliness of\r\nheart; and because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the\r\nvisitation of the Holy Ghost, which Comforter filleth with hope\r\nand perfect love, which love endureth by diligence unto prayer,\r\nuntil the end shall come, when all the saints shall dwell with\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:27\r\n 27 Behold, my son, I will write unto you again if I go not out\r\nsoon against the Lamanites. Behold, the pride of this nation, or\r\nthe people of the Nephites, hath proven their destruction except\r\nthey should repent.\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:28\r\n 28 Pray for them, my son, that repentance may come unto them.\r\nBut behold, I fear lest the Spirit hath ceased striving with\r\nthem; and in this part of the land they are also seeking to put\r\ndown all power and authority which cometh from God; and they are\r\ndenying the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:29\r\n 29 And after rejecting so great a knowledge, my son, they must\r\nperish soon, unto the fulfilling of the prophecies which were\r\nspoken by the prophets, as well as the words of our Savior\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nMoroni 8:30\r\n 30 Farewell, my son, until I shall write unto you, or shall meet\r\nyou again. Amen.\r\n\r\nMoroni 9\r\nChapter 9\r\n\r\nMoroni 9:1\r\n 1 My beloved son, I write unto you again that ye may know that I\r\nam yet alive; but I write somewhat of that which is grievous.\r\n\r\nMoroni 9:2\r\n 2 For behold, I have had a sore battle with the Lamanites, in\r\nwhich we did not conquer; and Archeantus has fallen by the sword,\r\nand also Luram and Emron; yea, and we have lost a great number of\r\nour choice men.\r\n\r\nMoroni 9:3\r\n 3 And now behold, my son, I fear lest the Lamanites shall\r\ndestroy this people; for they do not repent, and Satan stirreth\r\nthem up continually to anger one with another.\r\n\r\nMoroni 9:4\r\n 4 Behold, I am laboring with them continually; and when I speak\r\nthe word of God with sharpness they tremble and anger against me;\r\nand when I use no sharpness they harden their hearts against it;\r\nwherefore, I fear lest the Spirit of the Lord hath ceased\r\nstriving with them.\r\n\r\nMoroni 9:5\r\n 5 For so exceedingly do they anger that it seemeth me that they\r\nhave no fear of death; and they have lost their love, one towards\r\nanother; and they thirst after blood and revenge continually.\r\n\r\nMoroni 9:6\r\n 6 And now, my beloved son, notwithstanding their hardness, let\r\nus labor diligently; for if we should cease to labor, we should\r\nbe brought under condemnation; for we have a labor to perform\r\nwhilst in this tabernacle of clay, that we may conquer the enemy\r\nof all righteousness, and rest our souls in the kingdom of God.\r\n\r\nMoroni 9:7\r\n 7 And now I write somewhat concerning the sufferings of this\r\npeople. For according to the knowledge which I have received\r\nfrom Amoron, behold, the Lamanites have many prisoners, which\r\nthey took from the tower of Sherrizah; and there were men, women,\r\nand children.\r\n\r\nMoroni 9:8\r\n 8 And the husbands and fathers of those women and children they\r\nhave slain; and they feed the women upon the flesh of their\r\nhusbands, and the children upon the flesh of their fathers; and\r\nno water, save a little, do they give unto them.\r\n\r\nMoroni 9:9\r\n 9 And notwithstanding this great abomination of the Lamanites,\r\nit doth not exceed that of our people in Moriantum. For behold,\r\nmany of the daughters of the Lamanites have they taken prisoners;\r\nand after depriving them of that which was most dear and precious\r\nabove all things, which is chastity and virtue--\r\n\r\nMoroni 9:10\r\n 10 And after they had done this thing, they did murder them in a\r\nmost cruel manner, torturing their bodies even unto death; and\r\nafter they have done this, they devour their flesh like unto wild\r\nbeasts, because of the hardness of their hearts; and they do it\r\nfor a token of bravery.\r\n\r\nMoroni 9:11\r\n 11 O my beloved son, how can a people like this, that are\r\nwithout civilization--\r\n\r\nMoroni 9:12\r\n 12 (And only a few years have passed away, and they were a civil\r\nand a delightsome people)\r\n\r\nMoroni 9:13\r\n 13 But O my son, how can a people like this, whose delight is in\r\nso much abomination--\r\n\r\nMoroni 9:14\r\n 14 How can we expect that God will stay his hand in judgment\r\nagainst us?\r\n\r\nMoroni 9:15\r\n 15 Behold, my heart cries: Wo unto this people. Come out in\r\njudgment, O God, and hide their sins, and wickedness, and\r\nabominations from before thy face!\r\n\r\nMoroni 9:16\r\n 16 And again, my son, there are many widows and their daughters\r\nwho remain in Sherrizah; and that part of the provisions which\r\nthe Lamanites did not carry away, behold, the army of Zenephi has\r\ncarried away, and left them to wander whithersoever they can for\r\nfood; and many old women do faint by the way and die.\r\n\r\nMoroni 9:17\r\n 17 And the army which is with me is weak; and the armies of the\r\nLamanites are betwixt Sherrizah and me; and as many as have fled\r\nto the army of Aaron have fallen victims to their awful\r\nbrutality.\r\n\r\nMoroni 9:18\r\n 18 O the depravity of my people!

For\r\nif there be one among you that doeth good, he shall work by the\r\npower and gifts of God.\r\n\r\nMoroni 10:26\r\n 26 And wo unto them who shall do these things away and die, for\r\nthey die in their sins, and they cannot be saved in the kingdom\r\nof God; and I speak it according to the words of Christ; and I\r\nlie not.\r\n\r\nMoroni 10:27\r\n 27 And I exhort you to remember these things; for the time\r\nspeedily cometh that ye shall know that I lie not, for ye shall\r\nsee me at the bar of God; and the Lord God will say unto you: Did\r\nI not declare my words unto you, which were written by this man,\r\nlike as one crying from the dead, yea, even as one speaking out\r\nof the dust?\r\n\r\nMoroni 10:28\r\n 28 I declare these things unto the fulfilling of the prophecies.\r\nAnd behold, they shall proceed forth out of the mouth of the\r\neverlasting God; and his word shall hiss forth from generation to\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nMoroni 10:29\r\n 29 And God shall show unto you, that that which I have written\r\nis true.\r\n\r\nMoroni 10:30\r\n 30 And again I would exhort you that ye would come unto Christ,\r\nand lay hold upon every good gift, and touch not the evil gift,\r\nnor the unclean thing.\r\n\r\nMoroni 10:31\r\n 31 And awake, and arise from the dust, O Jerusalem; yea, and put\r\non thy beautiful garments, O daughter of Zion; and strengthen thy\r\nstakes and enlarge thy borders forever, that thou mayest no more\r\nbe confounded, that the covenants of the Eternal Father which he\r\nhath made unto thee, O house of Israel, may be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nMoroni 10:32\r\n 32 Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny\r\nyourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of\r\nall ungodliness and love God with all your might, mind and\r\nstrength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace\r\nye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are\r\nperfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God.\r\n\r\nMoroni 10:33\r\n 33 And again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ,\r\nand deny not his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the\r\ngrace of God, through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which\r\nis in the covenant of the Father unto the remission of your sins,\r\nthat ye become holy, without spot.\r\n\r\nMoroni 10:34\r\n 34 And now I bid unto all, farewell. I soon go to rest in the\r\nparadise of God, until my spirit and body shall again reunite,\r\nand I am brought forth triumphant through the air, to meet you\r\nbefore the pleasing bar of the great Jehovah, the Eternal Judge\r\nof both quick and dead.

The\r\neconomy has been in trouble since the Dutch ended development aid in\r\n1982. A drop in world bauxite prices that started in the late 1970s and\r\ncontinued until late 1986, was followed by the outbreak of a guerrilla\r\ninsurgency in the interior. The guerrillas targeted the economic\r\ninfrastructure, crippling the important bauxite sector and shutting down\r\nother export industries. These problems have created both high inflation\r\nand high unemployment. A small gain in economic growth of 3.6% was\r\nregistered in 1988 due to reduced guerrilla activity and improved\r\ninternational markets for bauxite.\r\n\r\nGDP: $1.27 billion, per capita $3,215; real growth rate 3.6%\r\n(1988 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 50% (1988 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 27% (1988)\r\n\r\nBudget: revenues $466 million;

By\r\ntreaty (9 February 1920), the nationals of the treaty powers have equal rights\r\nto exploit mineral deposits, subject to Norwegian regulation. Although US, UK,\r\nDutch, and Swedish coal companies have mined in the past, the only companies\r\nstill mining are Norwegian and Soviet. Each company mines about half a million\r\ntons of coal annually. The settlements on Svalbard are essentially company\r\ntowns. The Norwegian state-owned coal company employs nearly 60% of the\r\nNorwegian population on the island, runs many of the local services, and\r\nprovides most of the local infrastructure. There is also some trapping of seal,\r\npolar bear, fox, and walrus.\r\n\r\nElectricity: 21,000 kW capacity; 45 million kWh produced,\r\n11,420 kWh per capita (1989)\r\n\r\nCurrency: Norwegian krone (plural--kroner);\r\n1 Norwegian krone (NKr) = 100 ore\r\n\r\nExchange rates: Norwegian kroner (NKr) per US$1--6.5405 (January\r\n1990), 6.9045 (1989), 6.5170 (1988), 6.7375 (1987), 7.3947 (1986),\r\n8.5972 (1985)\r\n\r\n- Communications\r\nPorts: limited facilities--Ny-Alesund, Advent Bay\r\n\r\nAirports: 4 total, 4 usable; 1 with permanent-surface runways;\r\nnone with runways over 2,439 m; 1 with runways 1,220-2,439 m\r\n\r\nTelecommunications: 5 meteorological/radio stations;\r\nstations--1 AM, 1 (2 relays) FM, 1 TV\r\n\r\n- Defense Forces\r\nNote: demilitarized by treaty (9 February 1920)\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nCountry:  Swaziland\r\n- Geography\r\nTotal area: 17,360 km2; land area: 17,200 km2\r\n\r\nComparative area: slightly smaller than New Jersey\r\n\r\nLand boundaries: 535 km total; Mozambique 105 km, South Africa 430 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: none--landlocked\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: none--landlocked\r\n\r\nClimate: varies from tropical to near temperate\r\n\r\nTerrain: mostly mountains and hills; some moderately sloping plains\r\n\r\nNatural resources: asbestos, coal, clay, tin, hydroelelectric\r\npower, forests, and small gold and diamond deposits\r\n\r\nLand use: 8% arable land; NEGL% permanent crops; 67% meadows and pastures;\r\n6% forest and woodland; 19% other; includes 2% irrigated\r\n\r\nEnvironment: overgrazing; soil degradation; soil erosion\r\n\r\nNote: landlocked; almost completely surrounded by South Africa\r\n\r\n- People\r\nPopulation: 778,525 (July 1990), growth rate 3.1% (1990)\r\n\r\nBirth rate: 46 births/1,000 population (1990)\r\n\r\nDeath rate: 15 deaths/1,000 population (1990)\r\n\r\nNet migration rate: 0 migrants/1,000 population (1990)\r\n\r\nInfant mortality rate: 126 deaths/1,000 live births (1990)\r\n\r\nLife expectancy at birth: 48 years male, 55 years female (1990)\r\n\r\nTotal fertility rate: 6.0 children born/woman (1990)\r\n\r\nNationality: noun--Swazi(s); adjective--Swazi\r\n\r\nEthnic divisions: 97% African, 3% European\r\n\r\nReligion: 60% Christian, 40% indigenous beliefs\r\n\r\nLanguage: English and siSwati (official); government business conducted in\r\nEnglish\r\n\r\nLiteracy: 67.9%\r\n\r\nLabor force: 195,000; over 60,000 engaged in subsistence agriculture;\r\nabout 92,000 wage earners (many only intermittently), with 36% agriculture and\r\nforestry, 20% community and social services, 14% manufacturing, 9% construction,\r\n21% other; 24,000-29,000 employed in South Africa (1987)\r\n\r\nOrganized labor: about 10% of wage earners\r\n\r\n- Government\r\nLong-form name: Kingdom of Swaziland\r\n\r\nType: monarchy; independent member of Commonwealth\r\n\r\nCapital: Mbabane (administrative); Lobamba (legislative)\r\n\r\nAdministrative divisions: 4 districts; Hhohho, Lubombo, Manzini,\r\nShiselweni\r\n\r\nIndependence: 6 September 1968 (from UK)\r\n\r\nConstitution: none; constitution of 6 September 1968 was suspended on\r\n12 April 1973; a new constitution was promulgated 13 October 1978, but has not\r\nbeen formally presented to the people\r\n\r\nLegal system: based on South African Roman-Dutch law in statutory courts,\r\nSwazi traditional law and custom in traditional courts; has not accepted\r\ncompulsory ICJ jurisdiction\r\n\r\nNational holiday: Somhlolo (Independence) Day, 6 September (1968)\r\n\r\nExecutive branch: monarch, prime minister, Cabinet\r\n\r\nLegislative branch: bicameral Parliament (Libandla) is advisory\r\nand consists of an upper house or Senate and a lower house or\r\nHouse of Assembly\r\n\r\nJudicial branch: High Court, Court of Appeal\r\n\r\nLeaders:\r\nChief of State--King  MSWATI III (since 25 April 1986);\r\n\r\nHead of Government--Prime Minister Obed MFANYANA (since 12 July\r\n1989)\r\n\r\nPolitical parties: none; banned by the Constitution promulgated on\r\n13 October 1978\r\n\r\nSuffrage: none\r\n\r\nElections: no direct elections\r\n\r\nCommunists: no Communist party\r\n\r\nMember of: ACP, AfDB, CCC, FAO, G-77, GATT (de facto), IBRD, ICAO, IDA,\r\nIFAD, IFC, ILO, IMF, INTERPOL, ISO, ITU, NAM, OAU, Southern African Customs\r\nUnion, SADCC, UN, UNESCO, UPU, WHO\r\n\r\nDiplomatic representation: Ambassador Absalom Vusani MAMBA;\r\nChancery at 4301 Connecticut Avenue NW, Washington DC 20008;\r\ntelephone (202) 362-6683;\r\nUS--Ambassador (vacant), Deputy Chief of Mission Armajane KARAER;\r\nEmbassy at Central Bank Building, Warner Street, Mbabane (mailing address\r\nis P.

It has essentially full employment,\r\na modern distribution system, excellent internal and external\r\ncommunications, and a skilled and intelligent labor force. Timber,\r\nhydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy\r\nthat is heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms\r\naccount for about 90% of industrial output, of which the engineering\r\nsector accounts for 50% of output and exports. As the 1990s open,\r\nhowever, Sweden faces serious economic problems: long waits for\r\nadequate housing, the decay of the work ethic, and a loss of\r\ncompetitive edge in international markets.\r\n\r\nGDP: $132.7 billion, per capita $15,700;

Per capita output, general living standards, education\r\nand science, health care, and diet are unsurpassed in Europe. Inflation\r\nremains low because of sound government policy and harmonious\r\nlabor-management relations. Unemployment is negligible, a marked\r\ncontrast to the larger economies of Western Europe. This economic\r\nstability helps promote the important banking and tourist sectors. Since\r\nWorld War II, Switzerland's economy has adjusted smoothly to the great\r\nchanges in output and trade patterns in Europe and presumably can adjust\r\nto the challenges of the 1990s, in particular, the further economic\r\nintegration of Western Europe and the amazingly rapid changes in East\r\nEuropean political/economic prospects.\r\n\r\nGDP: $119.5 billion, per capita $17,800;

Economic difficulties are attributable, in part, to severe\r\ndrought in several recent years, costly but unsuccessful attempts to match\r\nIsrael's military strength, a falloff in Arab aid, and insufficient foreign\r\nexchange earnings to buy needed inputs for industry and agriculture. Socialist\r\npolicy, embodied in a thicket of bureaucratic regulations, in many instances\r\nhas driven away or pushed underground the mercantile and entrepreneurial spirit\r\nfor which Syrian businessmen have long been famous. Two bright spots: a sizable\r\nnumber of villagers have benefited from land redistribution, electrification,\r\nand other rural development programs; and a recent find of light crude oil\r\nhas enabled Syria to cut back its substantial imports of light crude. A\r\nlong-term concern is the additional drain of upstream Euphrates water by\r\nTurkey when its vast dam and irrigation projects are completed toward the end\r\nof the 1990s.\r\n\r\nGDP: $18.5 billion, per capita $1,540;

Real output again rose about 11%. The increasingly sophisticated\r\nmanufacturing sector benefited from export-oriented investment, and\r\nagriculture grew by 4.0% because of improved weather. The trade deficit\r\nof $5.2 billion was more than offset by earnings from tourism\r\n($3.9 billion), remittances, and net capital inflows. The government has\r\nfollowed a fairly sound fiscal and monetary policy, aided by increased\r\ntax receipts from the fast-moving economy. In 1989 the government\r\napproved new projects--roads, ports, electric power,\r\ncommunications--needed to refurbish the now overtaxed infrastructure.\r\nAlthough growth in 1990-91 must necessarily fall below the 1988-89 pace,\r\nThailand's immediate economic outlook is good, assuming the continuation\r\nof prudent government policies in the context of a\r\nprivate-sector-oriented development strategy.\r\n\r\nGNP: $64.5 billion, per capita $1,160;

During the first half of the 1980s, the petroleum sector\r\naccounted for nearly 80% of export earnings, 40% of government revenues,\r\nand almost 25% of GDP. In recent years, however, the economy has suffered\r\nbecause of the sharp fall in the price of oil. The government, in response to\r\nthe revenue loss, pursued a series of austerity measures that pushed the\r\nunemployment rate to 22% in 1988. Agriculture employs only about 11% of\r\nthe labor force and produces less than 3% of GDP. Since this sector is small, it\r\nhas been unable to absorb the large numbers of the unemployed. The\r\ngovernment currently seeks to diversify its export base.\r\n\r\nGDP: $3.75 billion, per capita $3,070; real growth rate - 2.0% (1988 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 15.0% (1989 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 22% (1988)\r\n\r\nBudget: revenues $1.4 billion;

Two successive drought-induced crop\r\nfailures have strained the government's budget and increased\r\nunemployment.  The current account fell from a $23 million surplus in\r\n1988 to a $390 million deficit in 1989. Despite its foreign payments\r\nproblems, Tunis appears committed to its IMF-supported structural\r\nadjustment program.

The economy has grown steadily since\r\nthe early 1980s, with real growth in per capita GDP increasing more than 6%\r\nannually. Agriculture remains the most important economic sector,\r\nemploying about 60% of the labor force, accounting for almost 20% of GDP, and\r\ncontributing about 25% to exports. Impressive growth in recent years has not\r\nsolved all of the economic problems facing Turkey. Inflation and interest rates\r\nremain high, and a large budget deficit will continue to provide difficulties\r\nfor a country undergoing a substantial transformation from a centrally\r\ncontrolled to a free market economy. The government has launched a\r\nmultimillion-dollar development program in the southeastern region, which\r\nincludes the building of a dozen dams on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers to\r\ngenerate electric power and irrigate large tracts of farmland. The planned\r\ntapping of huge quantities of Euphrates water has raised serious concern in the\r\ndownstream riparian nations of Syria and Iraq.\r\n\r\nGDP: $75 billion, per capita $1,350; real growth rate 1.8% (1989 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 68.8% (1989)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 15.8% (1988)\r\n\r\nBudget: revenues $12.1 billion;

For most of the past 15 years the economy has been devastated by\r\npolitical instability, mismanagement, and civil war, keeping Uganda poor\r\nwith a per capita income of about $300. (GDP remains below the levels\r\nof the early 1970s, as does industrial production.) Agriculture is the\r\nmost important sector of the economy, employing over 80% of the work\r\nforce. Coffee is the major export crop and accounted for 97% of export\r\nrevenues in 1988. Since 1986 the government has acted to rehabilitate and\r\nstabilize the economy by undertaking currency reform, raising producer\r\nprices on export crops, increasing petroleum prices, and\r\nimproving civil service wages. The policy changes are especially aimed at\r\ndampening inflation, which was running at over 300% in 1987, and boosting\r\nproduction and export earnings.\r\n\r\nGDP: $4.9 billion, per capita $300 (1988);

This wealth is based on oil and gas, and the\r\nfortunes of the economy fluctuate with the prices of those commodities.

The economy is essentially capitalistic with a generous admixture\r\nof social welfare programs and government ownership. Over the last decade\r\nthe Thatcher government has halted the expansion of welfare measures and\r\nhas promoted extensive reprivatization of the government economic sector.\r\nAgriculture is intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European\r\nstandards, producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the labor\r\nforce. Industry is a mixture of public and private enterprises, employing\r\nabout 24% of the work force and generating 22% of GDP. The UK is an\r\nenergy-rich nation with large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves;\r\nprimary energy production accounts for 12% of GDP, one of the highest\r\nshares of any industrial nation. Following the recession of 1979-81, the\r\neconomy has enjoyed the longest period of continuous economic growth it\r\nhas had during the last 30 years. During the period 1982-89 real GDP grew\r\nby about 25%, while the inflation rate of 14% was nearly halved. Between\r\n1986 and 1989 unemployment fell from 11% to about 6%. As a major trading\r\nnation, the UK will continue to be greatly affected by: world boom or\r\nrecession; swings in the international oil market; productivity trends in\r\ndomestic industry; and the terms on which the economic integration of\r\nEurope proceeds.\r\n\r\nGDP: $818.0 billion, per capita $14,300;

In 1986 real GDP grew by 6.6% and in 1987 by 4.9%. The recovery\r\nwas led by growth in the agriculture and fishing sectors, agriculture\r\nalone contributing 20% to GDP, employing about 11% of the labor force, and\r\ngenerating a large proportion of export earnings. Raising livestock,\r\nparticularly cattle and sheep, is the major agricultural activity. In\r\n1988, despite healthy exports and an improved current account, domestic\r\ngrowth slowed because of government concentration on the external sector,\r\nadverse weather conditions, and prolonged strikes. High inflation rates\r\nof about 80%, a large domestic debt, and frequent strikes remain major economic\r\nproblems for the government.\r\n\r\nGDP: $8.8 billion, per capita $2,950; real growth rate 1% (1989 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 80% (1989 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 9.0% (1989 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget: revenues $1.2 billion;

Rice is the staple crop;\r\nsubstantial amounts of maize, sorghum, cassava, and sweet potatoes are\r\nalso grown. The government permits sale of surplus grain on the open\r\nmarket. Most of the mineral resources are located in the north,\r\nincluding coal, which is an important export item. Following the\r\nend of the war in 1975, heavy handed government measures undermined\r\nefforts at an efficient merger of the agricultural resources of the\r\nsouth and the industrial resources of the north. The economy remains\r\nheavily dependent on foreign aid and has received assistance from\r\nCommunist countries, Sweden, and UN agencies. Inflation, although down\r\nfrom recent triple-digit levels, is still a major weakness, and per\r\ncapita output is among the world's lowest. Since early 1989 the\r\ngovernment has sponsored a broad reform program that seeks to turn more\r\neconomic activity over to the private sector.\r\n\r\nGNP: $14.2 billion, per capita $215; real growth rate 8% (1989 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 40% (1989 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 25% (1989 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget: revenues $3.2 billion;

As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and reaffirmed by President\r\nReagan's 1 September 1982 peace initiative, the final status of the West\r\nBank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors, and a peace\r\ntreaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the concerned\r\nparties.  Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will resolve the\r\nrespective boundaries.  Pending the completion of this process, it is US policy\r\nthat the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has yet to be\r\ndetermined.  In the view of the US, the term West Bank describes all of the\r\narea west of the Jordan River under Jordanian administration before the 1967\r\nArab-Israeli war.  However, with respect to negotiations envisaged in the\r\nframework agreement, it is US policy that a distinction must be made between\r\nJerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the city's special status\r\nand circumstances.  Therefore, a negotiated solution for the final status of\r\nJerusalem could be different in character from that of the rest of the West\r\nBank.\r\n\r\n- Geography\r\nTotal area: 5,860 km2; land area: 5,640 km2; includes West Bank,\r\nEast Jerusalem, Latrun Salient, Jerusalem No Man's Land, and the northwest\r\nquarter of the Dead Sea, but excludes Mt.

Industries\r\nusing advanced technology or requiring sizable financial resources have been\r\ndiscouraged by a lack of financial resources and Israeli policy. Capital\r\ninvestment has largely gone into residential housing, not into productive assets\r\nthat could compete with Israeli industry. A major share of GNP is derived from\r\nremittances of workers employed in Israel and neighboring Gulf states. Israeli\r\nreprisals against Palestinian unrest in the West Bank since 1987 have pushed\r\nunemployment up and lowered living standards.\r\n\r\nGNP: $1.0 billion, per capita $1,000; real growth rate - 15% (1988\r\nest.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget: revenues $47.4 million;

The technologically advanced\r\nareas--North America, Japan, and Western Europe--together account for\r\n65% of the gross world product (GWP) of $20.3 trillion; these developed\r\nareas grew in the aggregate at 3.5%. In contrast, the Communist (Second\r\nWorld) countries typically grew at between 0% and 2%, accounting for 23% of GWP.\r\nExperience in the developing countries continued mixed, with the newly\r\nindustrializing countries generally maintaining their rapid growth, and many\r\nothers struggling with debt, inflation, and inadequate investment. The year\r\n1989 ended with remarkable political upheavals in the Communist\r\ncountries, which presumably will dislocate economic production still further.\r\nThe addition of nearly 100 million people a year to an already overcrowded\r\nglobe will exacerbate the problems of pollution, desertification,\r\nunderemployment, and poverty throughout the 1990s.\r\n\r\nGWP (gross world product): $20.3 trillion, per capita $3,870; real growth\r\nrate 3.0% (1989 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 5%, developed countries; 100%,\r\ndeveloping countries with wide variations (1989 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nExports: $2,694 billion (f.o.b., 1988); commodities--NA;\r\npartners--in value, about 70% of exports from industrial countries\r\n\r\nImports: $2,750 billion (c.i.f., 1988); commodities--NA;\r\npartners--in value, about 75% of imports by the industrial countries\r\n\r\nExternal debt: $1,008 billion for less developed countries (1988 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustrial production: growth rate 5% (1989 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity: 2,838,680,000 kW capacity; 11,222,029 million kWh produced,\r\n2,140 kWh per capita (1989)\r\n\r\nIndustries: chemicals, energy, machinery, electronics, metals, mining,\r\ntextiles, food processing\r\n\r\nAgriculture: cereals (wheat, maize, rice), sugar, livestock products,\r\ntropical crops, fruit, vegetables, fish\r\n\r\nAid: NA\r\n\r\n- Communications\r\nPorts: Mina al Ahmadi (Kuwait), Chiba, Houston, Kawasaki, Kobe,\r\nMarseille, New Orleans, New York, Rotterdam, Yokohama\r\n\r\n- Defense Forces\r\nBranches: ground, maritime, and air forces at all levels of\r\ntechnology\r\n\r\nMilitary manpower: 29.15 million persons in the defense forces\r\nof the World (1987)\r\n\r\nDefense expenditures: 5.4% of GWP, or $1.1 trillion (1989 est.)\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nCountry:  Yemen Arab Republic\r\nYemen (Sanaa) or North Yemen\r\n- Geography\r\nTotal area: 195,000 km2; land area: 195,000 km2\r\n\r\nComparative area: slightly smaller than South Dakota\r\n\r\nLand boundaries: 1,209 km total; Saudi Arabia 628 km, PDRY 581 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 523 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n\r\nContiguous zone: 18 nm;\r\n\r\nContinental shelf: 200 meters;\r\n\r\nTerritorial sea: 12 nm\r\n\r\nDisputes: sections of the boundary with PDRY are indefinite or\r\nundefined; undefined section of boundary with Saudi Arabia\r\n\r\nClimate: desert; hot and humid along coast; temperate in central\r\nmountains; harsh desert in east\r\n\r\nTerrain: narrow coastal plain (Tihama); western mountains; flat\r\ndissected plain in center sloping into desert interior of Arabian Peninsula\r\n\r\nNatural resources: crude oil, rock salt, marble; small deposits of coal,\r\nnickel, and copper; fertile soil\r\n\r\nLand use: 14% arable land; NEGL% permanent crops; 36% meadows and\r\npastures; 8% forest and woodland; 42% other; includes 1% irrigated\r\n\r\nEnvironment: subject to sand and dust storms in summer;\r\novergrazing; soil erosion; desertification\r\n\r\nNote: controls northern approaches to Bab el Mandeb linking Red Sea\r\nand Gulf of Aden, one of world's most active shipping lanes\r\n\r\n- People\r\nPopulation: 7,160,981 (July 1990), growth rate 3.1% (1990)\r\n\r\nBirth rate: 52 births/1,000 population (1990)\r\n\r\nDeath rate: 17 deaths/1,000 population (1990)\r\n\r\nNet migration rate: - 4 migrants/1,000 population (1990)\r\n\r\nInfant mortality rate: 129 deaths/1,000 live births (1990)\r\n\r\nLife expectancy at birth: 48 years male, 49 years female (1990)\r\n\r\nTotal fertility rate: 7.6 children born/woman (1990)\r\n\r\nNationality: noun--Yemeni(s); adjective--Yemeni\r\n\r\nEthnic divisions: 90% Arab, 10% Afro-Arab (mixed)\r\n\r\nReligion: 100% Muslim (Sunni and Shia)\r\n\r\nLanguage: Arabic\r\n\r\nLiteracy: 15% (est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA; 70% agriculture and herding, 30% expatriate laborers\r\n(est.)\r\n\r\n- Government\r\nLong-form name: Yemen Arab Republic; abbreviated YAR\r\n\r\nType: republic; military regime assumed power in June 1974\r\n\r\nCapital: Sanaa\r\n\r\nAdministrative divisions: 11 governorates (muhafazat,\r\nsingular--muhafazah); Al Bayda, Al Hudaydah, Al Jawf,\r\nAl Mahwit, Dhamar, Hajjah, Ibb, Marib, Sadah, Sana,\r\nTaizz\r\n\r\nIndependence: November 1918 (from Ottoman Empire)\r\n\r\nConstitution: 28 December 1970, suspended 19 June 1974\r\n\r\nLegal system: based on Turkish law, Islamic law, and local customary law;\r\nhas not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction\r\n\r\nNational holiday: Proclamation of the Republic, 26 September (1962)\r\n\r\nExecutive branch: president, vice president, prime minister,\r\nfour deputy prime ministers, Council of Ministers (cabinet)\r\n\r\nLegislative branch: unicameral Consultative Assembly\r\n(Majlis ash-Shura)\r\n\r\nJudicial branch: State Security Court\r\n\r\nLeaders:\r\nChief of State--President Col.

A shortage of natural resources, a widely\r\ndispersed population, and an arid climate make economic development\r\ndifficult. The economy has grown at an average annual rate of only 2-3%\r\nsince the mid-1970s. The economy is organized along socialist lines,\r\ndominated by the public sector. Economic growth has been constrained by a\r\nlack of incentives, partly stemming from centralized control over production\r\ndecisions, investment allocation, and import choices.\r\n\r\nGNP: $1.2 billion, per capita $495;

A prominent feature of the reforms was the establishment\r\nof workers' self-management councils in all large plants, which were to\r\nselect managers, stimulate production, and divide the proceeds. The\r\ngeneral result of these reforms has been rampant wage-price inflation,\r\nsubstantial rundown of capital plant, consumer shortages, and a still\r\nlarger income gap between the poorer southern regions and the relatively\r\naffluent northern provinces of Hrvatska and Slovenija. In 1988-89 the\r\nbeleaguered central government has been reforming the reforms, trying\r\nto create an open market economy with still considerable state\r\nownership of major industrial plants. These reforms have been moving\r\nforward with the advice and support of the International Monetary Fund\r\nthrough a series of tough negotiations. Self-management supposedly is\r\nto be replaced by the discipline of the market and by fiscal austerity,\r\nultimately leading to a stable dinar. However, strikes in major plants,\r\nhyperinflation, and interregional political jousting have held back\r\nprogress. According to US economic advisers, only a highly unlikely\r\ncombination of genuine privatization, massive Western economic\r\ninvestment and aid, and political moderation can salvage this economy.\r\n\r\nGNP: $129.5 billion, per capita $5,464;

Agriculture,\r\na key sector of the economy, employs 75% of the population but generates\r\nunder 30% of GDP. The main impetus for economic development has been the\r\nextractive industries. Mining and mineral processing account for about\r\none-third of GDP and two-thirds of total export earnings. During the period\r\n1983-88 the economy experienced slow growth, high inflation, a rising foreign\r\ndebt, and a drop in foreign exchange earnings. Recent increases in foreign\r\nprices for copper--a key export earner--and other minerals offer some hope of\r\nreversing the economic decline. Zaire is the world's largest producer of\r\ndiamonds.\r\n\r\nGDP: $6.5 billion, per capita $195; real growth rate 2.8% (1988)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 82% (1988)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget: revenues $856 million;

Economic difficulties stem from a sustained drop in copper production\r\nand ineffective economic policies. In 1988 real GDP stood only slightly\r\nhigher than that of 10 years before, while an annual population growth of\r\nmore than 3% has brought a decline in per capita GDP of 25% during the same\r\nperiod.
